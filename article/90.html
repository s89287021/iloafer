						<p>The familiar scent settled on the nape of his neck, a posture so intimate that Jiang Juan only felt an overwhelming coldness. His sole source of warmth was the squirming kitten in his arms.</p><p>Jiang Juan almost forgot to breathe.</p><p>It was impossible not to feel afraid; he had just been terribly frightened and now found himself exposed. Jiang Juan's heart seemed about to jump out of his chest.</p><p>He took a light breath, but someone turned his face back, Shue Fangli gazing down at him with the same expression as usual, his smile gentle, yet Jiang Juan could sense a hint of cruelty.</p><p>"…Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly, "Did I just wake up?"</p><p>Shue Fangli replied without any discernible emotion, "No."</p><p>"Then… what about me…"</p><p>Jiang Juan's words were jumbled; he had so much to say, but when he opened his mouth, he didn't know what to express. In the end, he only lowered his head and stared at the hand that was holding him for a long time, slowly trying to slip away.</p><p>As he seemed on the verge of escape, Shue Fangli once again grasped his hand, even more forcefully this time.</p><p>"So many people have told you that this king is mad, yet you refuse to believe them," Shue Fangli spoke softly and gently, almost coaxingly, "It doesn't matter if you didn't believe it before; there's no need to dwell on it now. Go back and get some rest, forget all of this, as if it never happened, shall we?"</p><p>How could he possibly forget? Jiang Juan blinked his lashes slowly and said in a low voice, "Let me think about it."</p><p>Shue Fangli nodded, "Very well, this king will wait for you to decide."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…Then let go of my hand."</p><p>However, Shue Fangli didn't release Jiang Juan's hand. After waiting for a moment, Jiang Juan was about to turn his head to look at him when, in the next second, he was abruptly pulled into Shue Fangli's arms. Shue Fangli hugged him tightly, so much so that Jiang Juan felt pain.</p><p>"…Your Highness."</p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only let him hold her. After an indeterminate amount of time, Xue Fangli finally released Jiang Juan and instructed calmly, "Take the Empress Dowager back to the Cool Wind Courtyard."</p><p>Throughout the journey, Jiang Juan's eyelashes were lowered, and she was unusually quiet. Lanting looked at her with worry for a long time. When they returned to their room, she could no longer hold back.</p><p>"Master, will you...?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head and sat down with a confused expression.</p><p>The novel described it so clearly—the King was cruel, disregarding human ethics and being tyrannical and capricious. However, he firmly believed that the Prince was a good person.</p><p>No wonder the Prince said he was easy to deceive, no wonder the Prince said that if one wanted to hide something from him, he would not discover it.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not have any indication of discovering anything.</p><p>"I'm so stupid."</p><p>Jiang Juan's voice was very soft. Lanting hurriedly comforted her, "Why do you say such things about yourself, Master? You are not stupid at all."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked her, "Do...you know if the Prince...is truly that good?"</p><p>Lanting hesitated and said, "Master, I live with the maidservants in the mansion. They often tell me some stories about Lord, so..."</p><p>Jiang Juan answered for her, "You know."</p><p>Lanting waved her hand, "No, no. At first, I did not know either, just like Master, thinking that the Prince was a good person."</p><p>No matter how much she comforted Jiang Juan, it made no difference. Jiang Juan sighed and remained gloomy.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment and then sincerely said, "But Young Master, no matter how the Prince is, he treats you very well. He has not only told his servants many times that they should be good to you, but others in the mansion often say that the Prince treats Young Master as if he were something delicate, afraid of it melting or breaking."</p><p>What she said made sense, but Jiang Juan still had some doubts.</p><p>The scene inside Hall of Standing Snow was too bloody, and the Prince had been deceiving him all along. During the time when he didn't know, had the Prince done other favors?</p><p>The more Jiang Juan thought about it, the more confused he became. Whether or not this was just a psychological effect, he always felt a scent of blood on his body. Jiang Juan said, "Lanting, I want to take a bath."</p><p>Lanting hurriedly replied, "Alright, Young Master, wait a moment."</p><p>She went out and closed the door, but she noticed many guards standing outside. Lanting was puzzled and was about to step out when she was stopped by one of them. The guard asked, "Where are you going?"</p><p>Lanting whispered, "Young Master wants to take a bath, so I'm going to heat some water for him."</p><p>The guard said, "There's no need for you to go. When the water is ready, someone will bring it over."</p><p>Lanting was shocked, "What?"</p><p>After waiting at the door for a while, Jiang Juan curiously asked, "Lanting, what happened?"</p><p>Lanting forced a smile and said, "Young Master, hot water will be brought to you shortly."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "But..."</p><p>Lanting pulled open the door. The little cat that had been calmly lying in Jiang Juan's arms suddenly jumped out and leaped outside. Before Jiang Juan could finish his words, he hurriedly chased after it, only to be stopped by the guards just like Lanting.</p><p>A guard said, "Princess Consort, you cannot go out."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "Why not?"</p><p>The guard replied, "...the Prince ordered it. He told you to rest well and not run around."</p><p>Jiang Juan let out an "ah" and realized something. Although he didn't have difficulty with the guards, he only pursed his lips and said unhappily, "Help me catch the cat back."</p><p>By the time the guard brought Tuanzi back, Jiang Juan had already been angry for quite some time. He picked up the kitten again, rubbing it all over, "The Prince doesn't allow me to go out."</p><p>Lanting sighed and tried to comfort him, "Well, at least you don't like going out anyway, right?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "It's different."</p><p>"I can stay in myself, but I can't stand him not allowing me to go out."</p><p>Lanting: "……"</p><p>Saying that, Jiang Juan pounced on Tuanzi and climbed onto the bed with the cat. His reasoning was quite solid, "The Prince doesn't like cat hair, and he also dislikes me sleeping for too long, so I'll have to hold the cat and sleep for a long time."</p><p>What could Lanting say? He only helped Jiang Juan pull down the mosquito net and said helplessly, "Go to sleep."</p><p>Staying awake made him anxious, but even in his sleep, Jiang Juan didn't feel any better.</p><p>In his dream, he was picked up and sat in a man's lap. The room was dimly lit, and someone brought over a plate with a bunch of ripe grapes, their deep purple color glistening with droplets of water.</p><p>Slim fingers plucked a grape and fed it to Jiang Juan. He was used to being fed this way, so he opened his mouth without any reservations. In the next moment, the flesh on that pale fingertip, still dripping with juice, turned into a lump of blood.</p><p>It was a pair of eyes, and Jiang Juan recognized them. He almost fainted, but that hand continued to feed him.</p><p>"I don't want to eat."</p><p>"No, no, I really don't want to."</p><p>"Prince…"</p><p>The mosquito net swayed gently in the wind as Jiang Juan slept poorly, mumbling incomprehensibly. Later on, he seemed to be sobbing softly. Without knowing how long it had been like that, someone finally lifted the fluttering light curtain.</p><p>On the bed, the young man frowned, sleeping very restlessly. His eyelashes were wet with moisture—had he cried a lot or been frightened by nightmares?</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at him, intending to embrace Jiang Juan, but just as his fingers were about to touch Jiang Juan, he hesitated.</p><p>Even his nightmares were caused by him.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>He dared not hold him and even less so comfort him as usual. Xue Fangli wiped away Jiang Juan's tears and then bent down, gently kissing his eyelashes.</p><p>Picking up the cat sleeping beside him, Xue Fangli let down the curtain and walked out. He asked in a cool tone, "After he came back, how is...he?"</p><p>Lanting immediately understood that he was asking about Jiang Juan's condition. She shook her head, "Master is not...happy."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Hm," then added, "Take care of him."</p><p>With that, he took a step to leave as if his sole purpose had been to greet Lanting. Lanting clenched her hands together, struggling internally for a while before mustering the courage to say, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped walking and looked at her with an unreadable expression.</p><p>Lanting's eyelids flickered; she still managed to say the words she had rehearsed many times. She pleaded, "Do not treat Master this way."</p><p>"You cannot confine him for a lifetime."</p><p>"What...cannot be confined for a lifetime?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied coolly, "As long as he does not figure things out, this king will keep him confined. If he never figures things out in his lifetime, this king will confine him for a lifetime."</p><p>"At the beginning, it was Master who refused to leave when Your Highness said you would send him away."</p><p>Lanting: "But..."</p><p>Despite her fear, Lan Ting took a deep breath and asked her doubt: "If Young Master has made up his mind, but he... still cannot accept it?"</p><p>"That means he has not really made up his mind."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, his expression tinged with a faint darkness. "Keep thinking. Until he truly makes up his mind."</p><p>Lan Ting's lips moved, but she ultimately did not say anything. She stared blankly as Xue Fangli walked away, his black-gold robe exuding great nobility. Though his expression was clearly cold to the extreme, Lan Ting somehow felt that he too was afraid of something.</p><p>This afternoon, Jiang Juan had been sleeping, yet he had also been having nightmares.</p><p>When he fully woke up, it was already dusk.</p><p>This nap had left Jiang Juan very tired. He sluggishly sat up, dazed for a moment before pulling up the thin blanket. However, after looking around everywhere, there was no trace of the kitten. Jiang Juan asked Lan Ting, "Where's Tuanzi?"</p><p>Lan Ting softly replied, "Just now, the Prince came and took Tuanzi back."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, remaining silent for a long time before finally uttering an "Oh."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>"What 'and then'?"</p><p>Lan Ting was quite puzzled. Jiang Juan could only lower his head, clenching the thin blanket tightly as he slowly asked her, "What did the Prince say?"</p><p>She had said something, but those words Lan Ting dared not tell Jiang Juan. After pondering for a moment, she replied, "His Highness told me to take good care of you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was even more unhappy upon hearing this, "He tells you to take care of me, but what about the Prince? Does he not care at all?"</p><p>"He deceived me for so long and deliberately fed me grapes," Jiang Juan said. "He is the smartest one, playing me around and always watching my humiliation."</p><p>Recalling something, Jiang Juan became even more angry, "When he came back, didn't he come to argue with me? Between the cat and I, who is his concubine? He cares about the cat but not me?"</p><p>Lan Ting: "…?"</p><p>The young master should have been angry, but the reason for his anger was beyond Lan Ting's comprehension. Nevertheless, she tried to explain, "Young Master, he left when you were sleeping."</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to get so frustrated that she would faint, "He just left? I had nightmares all afternoon because of him, and he just left?"</p><p>"Why should he?" Jiang Juan became angrier by the thought, "He didn't argue with me, he didn't try to comfort me, nor did he apologize. He even only watched when I had nightmares."</p><p>"Is he human at all?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't stand this injustice any longer; he decided, "No way, the Prince is not getting away with it."</p><p>After a while, the guards rushed to the study and whispered something to the eunuch guarding the door. The eunuch's face changed instantly upon hearing the news. He pushed open the door and shouted, "Your Highness! Something terrible has happened!"</p><p>"The Concubine, the Concubine—he—his heart condition has flared up again!"</p><p>Lan Ting: "…?"</p><p>The young master should have been angry, but Lan Ting couldn't figure out why. She tried to explain, "Young Master, he left while you were sleeping."</p><p>Jiang Juan was on the verge of fainting from frustration, "He just left? I had nightmares all afternoon because of him, and he just left?"</p><p>"Why should he?" Jiang Juan grew angrier by the thought, "He didn't argue with me, he didn't try to comfort me, nor did he apologize. He even only watched when I had nightmares."</p><p>"Is he human at all?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't take any more of this injustice; he decided, "No way, the Prince is not getting away with it."</p><p>After a while, the guards rushed to the study and whispered something to the eunuch guarding the door. The eunuch's face changed instantly upon hearing the news. He pushed open the door and shouted, "Your Highness! Something terrible has happened!"</p><p>"The Concubine, the Concubine—he—his heart condition has flared up again!"</p><p>Lan Ting: "…?"</p><p>The young master should have been angry, but Lan Ting was at a loss as to why. She attempted to explain, "Young Master, he left while you were sleeping."</p><p>Jiang Juan was on the verge of fainting with frustration, "He just left? I had nightmares all afternoon because of him, and he just left?"</p><p>"Why should he?" Jiang Juan's anger grew, "He didn't argue with me, he didn't try to comfort me, nor did he apologize. He even only watched when I had nightmares."</p><p>"Is he human at all?"</p><p>Jiang Juan could no longer endure this injustice; he made up his mind, "No way, the Prince is not getting away with it."</p><p>After some time, the guards rushed to the study and whispered something to the eunuch guarding the door. The eunuch's face turned pale upon hearing the news. He pushed open the door and shouted, "Your Highness! Something terrible has happened!"</p><p>"The Concubine, the Concubine—he—his heart condition has flared up again!"</p>
