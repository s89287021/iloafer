						<p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a nod. His wrist was being squeezed painfully, but Jiang Juan couldn't care less. He asked anxiously, "You're coughing up blood, are you okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't answer; instead, he suddenly pulled Jiang Juan close and pressed him tightly to his chest.</p><p>He loved hugging Jiang Juan so much that he never wanted to let go, a fact he had never tried to hide.</p><p>Whenever they went out, he would carry Jiang Juan. Even when they ate or slept, he would never release his grip.</p><p>No matter how angry or agitated Xue Fangli was, as long as he held Jiang Juan close, all the negativity vanished without a trace.</p><p>This moment was no exception.</p><p>However, the sudden reunion left him restless. Xue Fangli pressed Jiang Juan to his chest with great force, almost as if he wanted to break his own waist and crush Jiang Juan's bones.</p><p>It hurt, it really hurt.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, but after hesitating, he didn't struggle because the person holding him was trembling all over.</p><p>"I'm fine, I really am."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke softly. He didn't know how to comfort Xue Fangli, so he endured the pain and reached out to gently pat Xue Fangli's back, repeatedly soothing him.</p><p>"Don't be afraid..."</p><p>The youth submitted quietly in his arms, just as on every other day and night. His breathing was slow and steady, filling not only Xue Fangli's arms but also his heart.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, inhaling the unique herbal scent that clung to the youth. The person in his embrace was so frail that a breeze could scatter him like smoke, yet he was fragile and strong at the same time, pulling Xue Fangli back to reality with his grip.</p><p>He was the last straw for Xue Fangli, the one he would grasp onto with all his might.</p><p>"How could you not be afraid."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, for he was afraid of too many things. Afraid that the youth would never wake up again, afraid that no one would play with him anymore, and afraid that no matter how unreasonable he became, nobody would get angry at him.</p><p>Forcing Ananda to appear, Xue Fangli could have destroyed the entire temple, using the lives of monks as leverage to bring Jiang Juan back. He could even kill everyone in the world, but even if he did so, the youth might still not return.</p><p>He had not failed to notice the abnormalities on the youth's body nor was he unaware that the youth might not belong here at all.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not believe in ghosts or gods, yet he sought help from them. He bowed before a thirty-seven-story pagoda and committed every evil deed just to retain his soul while leaving behind his wife.</p><p>Even if they were both sent to hell together, he would consider it a sweet deal.</p><p>When he heard him say that he was afraid, Jiang Juan froze and lifted her head.</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyes were red with fury, tinged with a hint of neurosis. In front of Jiang Juan, he might seem gentle or carefree, but Xue Fangli always handled matters with ease, acting nonchalantly as if neither heaven nor earth could move him in the slightest.</p><p>But now, he was admitting his fear aloud.</p><p>Jiang Juan stared at him for a long time, her heart filled with bitterness. "I'm sorry..."</p><p>She then showed him her hand subconsciously. "This is a relic; as long as it's here, I will be."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not speak, only lowering his eyes. On the youth's fair wrist, a bright red thread shone alongside the smooth relic. He stretched out his hand and gently touched it with his fingertips.</p><p>Jiang Juan was still worried about him and asked, "You were coughing up blood just now; how are you? Should we call for someone..."</p><p>Her words trailed off abruptly.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and kissed her.</p><p>It was a bitter kiss, filled with an unpleasant taste, heavy with the scent of blood. It was also a kiss regained, one in which Xue Fangli pressed fiercely, his lips and tongue exploring every part of her mouth, leaving his mark and his essence behind at each spot.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Is it not about giving him something? Mother, it's just that Jiang Juan is very worried. He tried to push Xue Fangli away several times, but couldn't move him. Jiang Juan could only turn his head and make a great effort to end this kiss.</p><p>"Let's go back first, okay? Let the imperial physician take a look at you."</p><p>Unsatisfied with his distraction, Xue Fangli pinched his chin and said, "It's nothing," before trying to kiss him again.</p><p>Jiang Juan hurriedly blocked his lips, shaking his head vigorously, "You've coughed up blood. There's definitely something wrong."</p><p>Xue Fangli inserted his fingers into Jiang Juan's hands, lifted his arm, not allowing him to block anymore, clearly showing that he didn't care. Jiang Juan had no choice but to speak softly, "Will you let someone take a look at you? Come on, my husband?"</p><p>"Husband, I really am worried about you."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Did you hear me? Husband? Husband, Husband, Husband."</p><p>The soft voice sounded like a cat's meow, calling out repeatedly by his ear as if he couldn't speak without the word 'husband.' Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and rubbed his fingertips, "There's no need."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't listen to that, "What you say doesn't count. Only the imperial physician can say it's nothing."</p><p>"Troublesome."</p><p>Xue Fangli scoffed lightly, picking up Jiang Juan in a cradle hold, instructing him, "Return to the palace."</p><p>Not even a few steps had passed when his sleeve was gently tugged. Xue Fangli looked over and saw Jiang Juan's brow furrowed, with clear eyes full of concern and unease. He asked Xue Fangli, "Are you really not going to see the imperial physician? Are you feeling okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "I said it's nothing."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still worried, "But..."</p><p>Not wanting to see him frown, Xue Fangli sighed lightly, "Understood."</p><p>"Let's call him the Imperial Physician then."</p><p>He finally relented.</p><p>When he returned to the palace, the Imperial Physician arrived very quickly.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan, Doctor Sun was taken aback but did not inquire further, merely sighing with relief inwardly.</p><p>In these few days without the new Empress Dowager, this new emperor seemed to have reverted to his old self. The cruelty and brutality in his character were evident, making everyone in the palace uneasy, fearing they might be punished for his anger. Now that Jiang Juan had awakened, it was naturally a great relief.</p><p>"I have seen His Majesty and the Empress."</p><p>Doctor Sun smiled and bowed, instinctively walking towards Jiang Juan and respectfully saying to him, "Empress, I am sorry, please extend your hand."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and took a while to react. He shook his head and explained, "It's not me; give it to Your Highness—the Emperor—he is coughing blood again."</p><p>Coughing up blood was no trivial matter. Upon hearing this, Doctor Sun hurriedly went to examine Xue Fangli's pulse. However, just as he placed his hands on him, he remembered something and looked puzzled.</p><p>He's coughing blood again?</p><p>Has this one ever coughed up blood before?</p><p>Why didn't I know?</p><p>In the past, Emperor Hongxing felt he owed Lord Li a great deal and wanted to make amends. After learning about Lord Li's madness and headaches, he specifically asked Doctor Sun to stay in the Wangfu to be readily available for summoning.</p><p>Logically speaking, Doctor Sun should have been aware of this one's condition if he had ever coughed up blood. Frowning, Doctor Sun said, "Your Majesty, when did you...?"</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly interrupted him, lifting his head and glancing at Doctor Sun with a faint expression that conveyed much.</p><p>Do not ask if it is not appropriate to inquire.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Doctor Sun closed his mouth and focused on taking his pulse.</p><p>A short while later, Doctor Sun understood the situation. He said softly, "Your Majesty, Empress Dowager has heart disease and should avoid great joy or sorrow; you too."</p><p>"In these recent days, your mood has been melancholic, and your qi and blood circulation have not been smooth. After a sudden change in emotion, if he coughs up blood, it would not be surprising."</p><p>Overall, there is nothing to worry about.</p><p>In fact, if Sch Li had coughed up blood, it might even be considered a good sign, as his qi and blood circulation have become much smoother.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not feel reassured after hearing this.</p><p>Regardless of joy or sorrow, Sch Li coughing up blood was due to him. In reality, Sch Li had been coughing up blood before, but it had not happened in a long time. Jiang Juan almost forgot about the matter and even that his health was poor, perhaps...</p><p>his days were numbered.</p><p>"Is there nothing wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Doctor Sun uncertainly, "But he has coughed up a lot of blood."</p><p>Doctor Sun smiled. "It is fine; Empress Dowager need not worry too much."</p><p>How could one not be worried? A person in good health had coughed up so much blood. Jiang Juan's furrowed brow did not relax for a long time. After a while, he asked Doctor Sun again, "Can you prescribe some medicine?"</p><p>"Any medicinal supplements or other medicines are fine; give him something to nourish his body."</p><p>Doctor Sun hesitated, "This..."</p><p>Sch Li said, "It is unnecessary."</p><p>"Some," Jiang Juan insisted, "Whenever I just felt a bit unwell in the past, you forced me to take tonics. Why isn't it necessary for yourself?"</p><p>"You should take it."</p><p>Jiang Juan made his final decision, regardless of what Xue Fangli said about it being unnecessary. He turned to Doctor Sun and said, "Ignore him. If I say you need to take medicine, you must do so. We are in charge here; he doesn't count."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>The person whose words didn't count could only make a soft sound of acknowledgment. Doctor Sun, seeing the situation, couldn't help but say with a mix of amusement and frustration, "Then prescribe a few doses?"</p><p>Actually, it wasn't absolutely necessary to prescribe medicine, but since he was coughing up blood, giving some tonic to replenish his blood would do no harm either. After careful consideration, Doctor Sun still provided a prescription.</p><p>Not long after, someone went to boil the medicine, and Doctor Sun took his leave.</p><p>Inside Lingguang Palace, only Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli remained.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan for a moment before he pinched his chin and lifted his face. "What are you unhappy about again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pushed away his hand but then voluntarily sat on Xue Fangli's lap, nuzzling into his chest and burying his face in it as well.</p><p>"I don't want to be widowed..."</p><p>Jiang Juan's voice was muffled. Previously, since Xue Fangli had never fallen ill, Jiang Juan hadn't thought about these things either, but now he couldn't help it.</p><p>"You keep coughing up blood. If something really happens to you, what will I do?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli with a heavy heart.</p><p>The person in his arms felt soft and warm, yet the place where his face was buried gradually became damp, warm all over. Xue Fangli reached out to touch it and found traces of tears.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Actually, to put it bluntly, he only coughed up blood twice, once on the pagoda and once just now. As Doctor Sun had said, it was merely due to his intense emotions.</p><p>Regarding the previous instances of coughing up blood, at their wedding, Xue Fangli was just fooling Jiang Juan. Later on, whenever he pretended to cough up blood, it was for ulterior motives, to soften Jiang Juan's heart.</p><p>If they were to clear things up, he would have to reveal all his past lies as well. Xue Fangli frowned slightly, a rare look of helplessness appearing on his face.</p><p>——One could imagine how the youth would react upon discovering that he had been deceived; how angry he would be.</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and pressed it against Jiang Juan's forehead, speaking in a soft and gentle tone. "How could I bear to let you spend your life as a widow? If you can live one day, I will live two days. If you can live two days, I will live three days... In our relationship, I am certain to outlive you. This lifetime, don't even think about spending your life mourning me, and don't dream of living a single day without me."</p><p>"If you keep crying, what's important won't be my coughing up blood, but rather your heart disease."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. He didn't want to cry either, but the thought of Xue Fangli potentially getting into trouble in the future made him unable to hold back his tears for long.</p><p>He quietly nestled himself in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the medicine finally boiled, and a servant brought it over.</p><p>"Give it to me."</p><p>Jiang Juan's voice still had a slight nasal twang. Every time he cried, his entire body would be wet with water vapor, making him look extremely pitiful.</p><p>Holding the spoon with his fingers, Jiang Juan lifted it, blew on it for a while, and then fed it to Xue Fangli personally. "Here, drink it."</p><p>The black traditional Chinese medicine had a bitter and fishy smell. Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched slightly. Jiang Juan brought the spoon to his lips and said softly, "Your Highness, you must finish this."</p><p>"If you don't drink it, how can I live one more day than you?"</p>
