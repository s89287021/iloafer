						<p>Jiang Juan handed his hand over to him without hesitation, "Okay."</p><p>The boy's hands were fair and slender, with a faint touch of rosy color at the fingertips.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at them and took Jiang Juan's hand.</p><p>He really wasn't afraid of himself; he even dared to extend his hand.</p><p>And...</p><p>it was quite soft.</p><p>Seeing this, the servant let go of Jiang Juan and stopped supporting him. Jiang Juan moved forward a step, but he hadn't recovered from those arrows earlier, and his legs were still trembling. This movement caused him to fall straight forward.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>This is going to be embarrassing.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt like he was about to crash in front of everyone like a dog eating sh*t, but suddenly someone pulled him back, causing him to stumble into Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. Xue Fangli asked, "Third Young Master, what happened?"</p><p>Was it his legs trembling or being scared? Jiang Juan wanted to speak up, but he thought it would be too embarrassing to tell the truth, so he decided not to lie and instead came up with an excuse, "...my chest hurts."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down; Jiang Juan did indeed look very unwell. At this close proximity, he could smell a faint herbal scent coming from the boy.</p><p>He didn't dislike this smell.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Then let's rest before we continue walking."</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled an "Oh," and glanced at Xue Fangli, even more puzzled in his heart.</p><p>Isn't Wang not a good talker?</p><p>What is the description of him in the book?</p><p>Is the author redefining the terms disregard for human relations and tyrannical cruelty?</p><p>Jiang Juan thought about it and couldn't figure it out, so she decided to give up. At this point, he also felt that he had rested enough and could move. He took a few steps back, tugged on Xue Fangli's sleeve, "Prince Wang, I'm done."</p><p>As he stepped back, the fragrance lingering around Xue Fangli's nostrils gradually faded away, and Jiang Juan couldn't smell it anymore.</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned slightly but spoke normally, "Alright, let's go."</p><p>This wedding was hastily arranged. Not only were both Xue Fangli and Jiang Juan wearing regular clothes, but even Li Wangfu only managed to hang lanterns and red ribbons at the entrance in time. As for inside the mansion, everything remained the same as usual.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced around a few times but didn't really care.</p><p>He was thinking about something else now. According to the original plot, Xue Fangli should be about to have an episode, right?</p><p>Jiang Juan started glancing at Xue Fangli furtively.</p><p>Xue Fangli noticed and thoughtfully rubbed the small leaf sandalwood beads on his wrist without inquiring further.</p><p>They entered the wedding hall, and a matchmaker respectfully handed them a red ribbon. Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli each took one end.</p><p>Just as Jiang Juan gripped the red ribbon tightly, she noticed something was amiss.</p><p>The man beside her seemed to have stopped moving.</p><p>Her hand that held the red ribbon started shaking uncontrollably, veins protruding under his pale skin. Xue Fangli half-closed his eyes, frowning intensely, while his other hand rested on his temple, seemingly in extreme pain.</p><p>He had a splitting headache and was having an episode.</p><p>This seemed like a signal. All the people in Xitang—the estate's executives, maidservants, servants, guards, and even the midwife—kneeled down in reverence, their foreheads touching the ground, not daring to breathe.</p><p>The executive reached into his robe, but due to his trembling fingers, he had to try several times before successfully taking out the medicine bottle. He then cautiously poured the contents out of it.</p><p>"Knock knock knock——"</p><p>Amidst the silence, only the sound of the bottle mouth tapping against his palm could be heard. However, despite multiple attempts, the executive failed to pour out any pills. His face turned pale as he realized something.</p><p>There was no more medicine.</p><p>He paused in his breathing.</p><p>"W-Wang… Prince…"</p><p>"Are you experiencing a headache?"</p><p>The executive and Jiang Juan spoke simultaneously. The executive looked at him with shock and anger—among everyone in Xitang, only this Third Young Master stood upright. For a moment, the executive couldn't determine whether to call him ignorant and fearless or commendable for his courage.</p><p>It was common knowledge throughout the capital that although Prince Li was severely ill, he had an unpredictable temper and was ruthless and vicious. Encountering him during one of his fits could be deadly.</p><p>Jiang Juan received the look from the executive and was quite puzzled, though he was even more bewildered by why everyone had knelt down. However, this didn't seem to matter much at the moment.</p><p>After a brief hesitation, Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli, "Do you want me to massage your head? It might alleviate some of the pain."</p><p>Before undergoing heart surgery, Jiang Juan had actually stayed in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital for a period of time. Given the low success rate of the operation, his family strongly opposed taking the risk. He could do nothing but rest in his ward and even couldn't take long walks. Thus, he had to learn massage from an elderly TCM doctor in the neighboring ward.</p><p>Although he only learned the basics, it should still be able to alleviate some pain, as a way of thanking him for helping him earlier.</p><p>Jiang Juan waited for a moment, but when Xue Fangli didn't respond, he thought that perhaps Xue Fangli didn't trust him and added, "I really know how to give massages."</p><p>Xue Fangli finally lifted his eyelids; bloodshot eyes almost red with pain. The agony was evident as he stared at Jiang Juan expressionlessly and said, "Alright."</p><p>Sigh, I wonder if the absence of Third Young Master will attract blame from the nobles in the palace.</p><p>Jiang Juan tossed aside the red silk and forced Xue Fangli to sit on the chair, completely oblivious to the man's eyes resting on his neck and the extremely sinister look in them.</p><p>Caught off guard, Xue Fangli raised his hand, his fingertips touching Jiang Juan's skin.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "What?"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him, slightly closing his fingers as if about to exert force. He then smelled a faint fragrance.</p><p>A vague, barely perceptible herbal scent.</p><p>His movements paused.</p><p>The irritability and anxiety caused by the headache seemed to be soothed by something. Sniffing this smell—a scent he didn't dislike and even rather enjoyed—Xue Fangli's mind gradually calmed down.</p><p>Xue Fangli's fingers were very cold, causing Jiang Juan to shiver slightly. He asked Xue Fangli again, "Is there something wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked into the youth's clear eyes, paused, then said in a calm tone, "There is a red mole here."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head; the mole was precisely at the neck hollow, which he couldn't see. However, Jiang Juan still gasped in surprise.</p><p>What a coincidence, there is also a red mole on me.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded casually, "Yes, there is one."</p><p>Xue Fangli retracted his hand, and Jiang Juan stood up to stand behind him, starting to massage him.</p><p>The youth's strength was very light, and he found the acupoints accurately. However, that was all; he only knew how to do it. Xue Fangli didn't stop him; with his eyes closed lightly, he remained silent, breathing in the scent emanating from the youth's body, and the sinister aura around him gradually dissipated.</p><p>With a snap, cold sweat trickled down the executive's forehead. He silently sighed, his gaze at Jiang Juan as indifferent as looking at a dead man.</p><p>Sigh, I wonder if Third Young Master's absence will bring blame from the nobles in the palace.</p><p>Jiang Juan tossed aside the red silk and forced Xue Fangli to sit on the chair, completely oblivious to the man's eyes resting on his neck and the extremely sinister look in them.</p><p>Caught off guard, Xue Fangli raised his hand, his fingertips touching Jiang Juan's skin.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "What?"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him, slightly closing his fingers as if about to exert force. He then smelled a faint fragrance.</p><p>A vague, barely perceptible herbal scent.</p><p>His movements paused.</p><p>The irritability and anxiety caused by the headache seemed to be soothed by something.

However, that was all; he only knew how to do it. Xue Fangli didn't stop him; with his eyes closed lightly, he remained silent, breathing in the scent emanating from the youth's body, and the sinister aura around him gradually dissipated.</p><p>With a sharp click, cold sweat trickled down the executive’s forehead as he let out a silent sigh. His gaze at Jiang Juan was as indifferent as looking at a corpse.</p><p>Sigh, I wonder if Third Young Master’s absence will invite blame from the nobles in the palace.</p><p>Jiang Juan discarded the red silk and forced Xue Fangli to sit on the chair, completely oblivious to the man's eyes resting on his neck and the intensely sinister look in them.</p><p>Caught off guard, Xue Fangli raised his hand, his fingertips touching Jiang Juan’s skin.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback.

However, that was all; he only knew how to do it. Xue Fangli didn’t stop him; with his eyes closed lightly, he remained silent, breathing in the scent emanating from the youth’s body, and the sinister aura around him gradually dissipated.</p><p>High Executive Officer kneeled for a long time but never heard any cries of pain. He cautiously lifted his head and immediately dropped his jaw in surprise.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why didn't the Prince kill him?</p><p>That shouldn't be the case.</p><p>High Executive Officer stood rooted to the spot, his gaze lingering too long. Xue Fangli looked at him with an intimation, causing High Executive Officer to shiver and suddenly crawl to the ground, his heart pounding fiercely.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke wearily, "Go fetch medicine."</p><p>High Executive Officer hurriedly replied, "Yes!"</p><p>He stood up in a cold sweat, turned around, and ran off, wishing he could run as fast as possible.</p><p>Jiang Juan massaged Xue Fangli for quite some time. Tiring of it, he began to slack off, trying to use words instead of action, "Does Your Highness always have headaches?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>In fact, this was Jiang Juan's first attempt at massage therapy. He had been a spoiled child all his life and, due to poor health, had been treated almost like an eye in the family. Fortunately, Jiang Juan's character was good, apart from not being able to endure hardship, he had no other bad habits.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli again, "Was my massage okay?"</p><p>"… Acceptable."</p><p>Jiang Juan was satisfied with himself.</p><p>Not long after, High Executive Officer returned. He seemed to dare not linger for a moment, leaving drenched in cold sweat and returning in a rush of sweat. Xue Fangli took the medicine bottle.</p><p>The massage master seized the opportunity to run away. Jiang Juan looked down curiously, remembering that the text had not explicitly introduced Li Wang's illness, only stating it was incurable. He asked, "Your Highness, what is your illness?"</p><p>Throat rolling a few times, Xue Fangli swallowed the pill. However, his gaze suddenly turned cold.</p><p>What illness? Madness.</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan indifferently.</p><p>The third son of the Shangshu Mansion, said to have grown up in the countryside from childhood, was timid and shrinking. He did not believe it.</p><p>To kill him would be as easy as turning his palm over.</p><p>But...</p><p>Xue Fangli recalled the young man's gaze. An inexplicable joy and expectation, pure like not a single speck of dust had touched it, looking at him just for him, without fear or anxiety, just staring at him.</p><p>Killing him was unnecessary.</p><p>Driving him away would be enough.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Fangli slowly spoke: "Coughing up blood."</p><p>The medicine seemed to alleviate his pain. Xue Fangli put on that layer of urbane exterior again, though there was a hint of detachment in his expression.</p><p>Coughing up blood.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes widened.</p><p>Diseases that caused coughing up blood seemed rather serious, no wonder the Xue Fangli in the book died on his second day of marriage.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and then honestly asked Xue Fangli: "Your Majesty, are you feeling better? Can we continue with the ceremony?"</p><p>"Not at all," Jiang Juan blinked. If being a happy anchovy was considered a burden, he would willingly endure it for life. He sincerely added, "Your Majesty is as pure and upright as the clear moon and bright sun; considering me as your equal is too high an honor for me."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him. The young man's dark eyes were filled with sincerity. Tapping the medicine bottle a few more times, he said after a long pause, "Since that is the case, I will ask you again in a few days."</p><p>With that, he lowered his head and coughed softly; bloodstains appeared between his fingers.</p><p>Jiang Juan saw this and sighed deeply.</p><p>Alas, not many days later, you were gone from the novel by Chapter 3.</p><p>A servant brought a golden basin to Xue Fangli. He washed his hands leisurely, and as the water rippled, Xue Fangli inexplicably recalled Jiang Juan's words.</p><p>So weak that even taking a few steps caused chest pain—how much longer could he last?</p><p>He silently snorted inwardly but spoke in a gentle voice.</p><p>"Then let us continue with the ceremony."</p><p>The matchmaker, knowing she had just made a lap around Hell's gate, hastily wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. Putting on a big smile, she yelled at the top of her lungs, "First bow to heaven and earth!"</p><p>"Second bow to our parents!"</p>
