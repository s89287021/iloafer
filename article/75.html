						<p>Accompanying the flickering candle and ancient Buddha, do not enter the palace.</p><p>Do not enter the palace.</p><p>The Empress Dowager's eyelid trembled. She came with joy, but now her heart was filled with sorrow. In these ten years that Emperor Hongxing had avoided her, she had shed all her tears, and could no longer cry even a single drop.</p><p>What did she do wrong?</p><p>Her husband, bewitched by a demon, became so obsessed that he disregarded moral norms; she merely wanted to find someone to help him! </p><p>"Husband, I did it for your own good."</p><p>The Empress Dowager moved her lips. "Which of my actions was not for you? In the end, you repaid me with this!"</p><p>Everyone knew that the Empress Dowager had long resided in the palace, devoted to Buddhism, praying day and night for blessings for over a decade. Yet no one realized it was merely because Emperor Hongxing and she had parted ways, unwilling to see her as his mother.</p><p>But now, not only did Emperor Hongxing avoid her, he even wanted to tear off the last shred of dignity and send her away, forcing her out of the palace!</p><p>Truly a life spent with flickering candles and ancient Buddha.</p><p>Truly do not enter the palace.</p><p>The Empress Dowager was so furious that her whole body shook. She gritted her teeth and said, "Husband, how heartless you are."</p><p>"For your own good..."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing raised his head, his eyes bloodshot. "Mother, could you possibly not know—Qingmei, she is my life! For her, I would defy the entire world. Does it matter if she is Jiang's husband? Or his brother? I do not care! I only want Qingmei!"</p><p>"You know everything, yet what did you do?"</p><p>"The dagger, letting a fire start in Chunshen Hall!"</p><p>Emperor Xinghong laughed loudly: "He was always seeking death. Mother, even if you let him go and he could never find me in this life or the next, I wouldn't hate you for it. You say you're doing this for my sake—wanting to die, handing over a dagger, dying yourself, and having your body seized by others, Mother—"</p><p>"Are you really doing this for my sake?"</p><p>Emperor Xinghong wept with blood in his voice, and Empress Dowager nearly lost her balance. The Grand Palace hurriedly went forward to support her, but Empress Dowager pushed him away. "Do you blame me?"</p><p>"I came into the palace as a low-ranking concubine, yet not only did you insist on burying him in the imperial mausoleum, but also you insisted on a burial befitting an empress dowager. Do you know what the court officials say about you? Do you know how the historians record it?"</p><p>Empress Dowager said sorrowfully, "My Emperor, he was the child I bore after nine months of pregnancy. How could I bear to see him condemned by future generations? Besides..."</p><p>"That boy is full of evil energy. The monk's way to resolve it can only be this method. He has already killed Lady Youmeini, and now it will be you, my Emperor. How could I stand idly by?"</p><p>"For your sake—yes, for your sake."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong closed his eyes. "Mother, not mentioning it doesn't mean I don't know. You claim that he was banished because he brought bad luck and would bring misfortune to his parents, but the monk at Cong'an Temple said—it was you who made these arrangements with him!"</p><p>"You weren't doing this for me from beginning to end," Emperor Xinghong said. "Mother, you were only doing it for yourself!"</p><p>He knew.</p><p>He actually knew.</p><p>Empress Dowager was stunned and stumbled a few steps. She refused the Grand Palace's support and could only lean heavily on the wall, barely standing. Empress Dowager struggled to say, "Emperor..."</p><p>She had lied so many times that she even believed her own lies.</p><p>Yes, her intention from the start was just to vent her hatred.</p><p>Her hatred for Jiang Qingmei.</p><p>There was nothing special about her background, and entering the palace was an absurd thing. It was only because after entering the palace, her emperor would not listen to her advice.</p><p>How could she not hate.</p><p>She hated him to death.</p><p>His Majesty, who had raised him and nurtured him, had worked hard for him and laid everything out meticulously during the late emperor's reign, eventually allowing him to ascend to this supreme position. Yet, all he could see was that person!</p><p>He wished that person would die, and he even wished to tear that person limb from limb!</p><p>But when that person truly died, their ghost still lingered, leaving her with no peace of mind and causing a complete rift between her and Emperor Hongxing, so much so that she had not seen him in years!</p><p>The empress dowager's breathing quickened as she was ruthlessly exposed. She felt as if she had been slapped hard across the face, feeling extremely humiliated.</p><p>After a long moment of stunned silence, the empress dowager slowly spoke up, "Majesty, have you really thought this through?"</p><p>"If you insist on sending me to Cha'an Temple, I will never return to the palace—thereafter, you need not recognize me as your mother anymore, and I shall no longer consider you my son!"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing looked at her, his lips trembling uncontrollably, unable to utter a word for a long time.</p><p>Though he knew about the matter very well, he had never mentioned it, out of respect for his bond with the empress dowager as mother and son. However, his indecisiveness had allowed that matter to run its course.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing remained silent for a long time. In the midst of the silence, hope began to stir in the empress dowager's heart.</p><p>But in the next second, her heart plummeted to the lowest depths.</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing lifted his sleeves and slowly knelt down on the ground. With a thud, he bowed his head to his mother, "This bow repays your nurturing kindness."</p><p>With another thud, Emperor Hongxing performed a second kowtow, "This bow repays my lack of care for you over these past ten years."</p><p>The third bow was yet to be completed when the Empress Dowager had already turned and left. Emperor Hongxing, however, continued at his own unhurried pace, bowing once more.</p><p>"With this bow, from now on, there is no connection between me and Mother. Mother, take care of yourself in the future."</p><p>The Empress Dowager paused, something fell—she reached out to wipe it away, and it was tears.</p><p>The Empress Dowager wiped away her tears dazedly and walked forward without looking back. But before she took a few steps, the world went dark around her, and she collapsed to the ground.</p><p>"Empress Dowager!"</p><p>"Empress Dowager——!"</p><p>The Grand Palace attendant hurriedly pushed her over, crying out, "Physician! The Empress Dowager has fainted, call for a physician quickly—!"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing moved but did not go forward. He asked wearily, "Is this what you want?"</p><p>A screen was lowered by the attendants, and Xue Fangli and Jiang Juan were behind it. Xue Fangli lazily asked Jiang Juan, "Are you satisfied?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's request had been for Emperor Hongxing to punish Concubine Mei and the Empress Dowager.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never really been angry; the Empress Dowager had tried to choke him a few times, but his slap never landed. However, since the Prince was well-intentioned, he nodded, "Yes, I am satisfied."</p><p>Xue Fangli then replied, "If he is satisfied, Your Majesty is also satisfied."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing did not give up there, however. He asked Xue Fangli, "And what about you?"</p><p>"Your Majesty?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, "Father, it has been ten years; it is too late now."</p><p>Emperor Xinggong was taken aback.</p><p>He understood Schue Fangli's intentions. Ten years ago, after those ten thousand days, if he had immediately ordered the Empress Dowager to be sent to Zhaoguan Temple and forbidden from entering the palace for the rest of his life, Schue Fangli might have been satisfied.</p><p>But ten long years had passed, and all he did was avoid seeing the Empress Dowager. It seemed as though he didn't know what to do, but in fact, he was shielding her in another way.</p><p>It was too late.</p><p>Really too late.</p><p>Emperor Xinggong's gaze dimmed, "I understand."</p><p>Schue Fangli ignored this response, "Father, if there is no further matter, I will take my leave now."</p><p>Emperor Xinggong gave a wry smile and waved his hand, "Go."</p><p>"Rest well these few days. If nothing goes wrong, on the day of ancestral worship, after the ceremony, I will issue an edict to establish a crown prince."</p><p>Schue Fangli nodded and left with Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan couldn't help but turn his head to look. Emperor Xinggong was being helped onto the dragon bed; he seemed to have aged greatly in an instant, his entire demeanor filled with despondency.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had been staring for too long, so Schue Fangli asked him. Jiang Juan hesitated and shook his head. He hadn't intended to say anything, but Schue Fangli pressed him, "Do you find him pitiable? Has Your Majesty overreacted, should you forgive him?"</p><p>"No, that's not it," Jiang Juan hurriedly explained, "Those who are pitiable must have hateful aspects as well. It was the Emperor who made a mistake; if Your Highness doesn't want to forgive, no one will force you to."</p><p>Schue Fangli said, "You can."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "Ah?"</p><p>Schue Fangli spoke slowly, "If you cannot bear it and wish me to forgive him, I can forgive. So—do you wish me to forgive him?"</p><p>"The King will follow your advice."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Do I mean everything you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed unconcerned, even his voice carried a hint of amusement, "The King has always been afraid of his wife, so naturally whatever you say, the King will listen to."</p><p>After hearing him finish, Jiang Juan deliberately said, "Then great, forgive His Majesty then."</p><p>Even if the Prince himself did not want to forgive, even if there was still resentment in his heart.</p><p>"Everything the wife says is right."</p><p>Xue Fangli lightly interrupted him, "If you feel sorry for him and can't stop thinking about it at night, unable to sleep, the King will have to spend effort soothing you."</p><p>"That's too troublesome, it would be better to solve it once and for all," Xue Fangli said with a flat tone.</p><p>Xue Fangli was not surprised, "Little liar."</p><p>"The King will follow your advice."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Do I mean everything you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed unconcerned, even his voice carried a hint of amusement. "The King has always been afraid of his wife, so naturally whatever you say, the King will listen to."</p><p>After hearing him finish, Jiang Juan deliberately said, "Then great, forgive His Majesty then."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and hesitated for a moment, as if he were about to speak to Emperor Hongxing. But right as he opened his mouth, Jiang Juan hurriedly grabbed his hand. "Prince, don't."</p><p>Xue Fangli turned his head. "Hmm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him, unsure how to describe her feelings. The emperor looked pitiful, but he was also the root of all the trouble and the source of Prince Fangli's misfortune. Yet when Jiang Juan said she wanted him to forgive, the Prince seemed genuinely willing to let go of all his hatred.</p><p>Even if the Prince himself did not want to forgive, even if there was still resentment in his heart.</p><p>He remained silent, and Xue Fangli asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan softly complained, "Why should I make decisions for your own affairs? What I say is not always right. If you want to forgive, then forgive; if not, don't..."</p><p>"Everything the wife says is right."</p><p>Xue Fangli lightly interrupted him, "If you feel sorry for him and can't stop thinking about it at night, unable to sleep, the King will have to spend effort soothing you."</p><p>"That's too troublesome. It would be better to solve it once and for all," Xue Fangli said with a flat tone.</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly at him, after a long moment muttered, "He is pitiful, but... I don't forgive. Prince, if you don't want to forgive, then I won't allow you to forgive either. Just now... I was deceiving you."</p><p>Xue Fangli was not surprised. "Little liar."</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended she did not hear and merely complained, "I haven't always let you soothe me either."</p><p>"The King will follow your advice."</p><p>Jiang Juan inquired, "Do I mean everything you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed entirely indifferent, his voice tinged with a hint of amusement. "The King has always been fearful of his wife, so naturally, whatever you say, the King will heed."</p><p>After finishing, Jiang Juan deliberately remarked, "Then very well, forgive His Majesty."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and paused momentarily, as if he were about to address Emperor Hongxing. But just as he opened his mouth, Jiang Juan hastily grabbed his hand. "Prince, do not."</p><p>Xue Fangli turned his head. "Hmm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan gazed at him, unsure how to articulate her emotions. The emperor appeared pitiful, yet he was also the source of all the trouble and the cause of Prince Fangli's misfortune. Even when Jiang Juan urged him to forgive, the Prince seemed genuinely willing to let go of all his grievances.</p><p>Even if the Prince did not wish to forgive, even if resentment lingered in his heart.</p><p>He remained silent, and Xue Fangli asked, "What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan softly complained, "Why should I make decisions for your own affairs? What I say is not always right. If you wish to forgive, then forgive; if not, don't..."</p><p>"Everything the wife says is right."</p><p>Xue Fangli interrupted him lightly, "If you feel sorry for him and cannot stop thinking about it at night, unable to sleep, the King will have to exert effort in soothing you."</p><p>"That would be too troublesome. It would be better to resolve it once and for all," Xue Fangli said with a flat tone.</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly at him, after a long moment muttered, "He is pitiful, but... I do not forgive. Prince, if you do not wish to forgive, then I will not allow you to forgive either. Just now... I was deceiving you."</p><p>Xue Fangli was unsurprised. "Little liar."</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended she did not hear and merely complained, "I have not always let you soothe me either."</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered, "Is that so."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>There was no longer any emotion, none at all.</p><p>He sullenly lowered his head and made up his mind not to pay attention to the Prince, but after taking a few steps, the Empress Dowager slowly regained consciousness and immediately saw Xue Fangli. The emaciated Empress Dowager called out to him, "Xue Fangli."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored her, while Jiang Juan stopped in his tracks, instinctively looking over. Xue Fangli calmly said, "Continue walking; there's no need to pay attention."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not give the Empress Dowager a glance, and she didn't care either. She merely slowly stated, "You've done such heinous things, killed so many people. One day, you'll face retribution!"</p><p>"I know that you don't believe in cause and effect or retribution. Regardless, I tell you, it's not that there's no retribution; the time has yet to come."</p><p>"Empress Dowager..."</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't bear to listen any longer, but just as he was about to open his mouth, Xue Fangli picked him up, causing Jiang Juan to jump in fright and hastily wrapped his arms around him. "Prince."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't give him a chance to speak, directly carrying Jiang Juan out of the Yangxin Pavilion. Jiang Juan felt even more depressed, lowering his head and gently bumping into Xue Fangli several times. He asked, "I haven't finished speaking yet."</p><p>"What's the point?"</p><p>Palace lanterns lit the way, the light as bright as day. Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "It's just that we've reached a dead end, so I'm merely cursing a few words. If you respond, this prince fears you'll be thirsty."</p><p>Jiang Juan stopped bumping him but was still not happy. "Then why? Prince, you haven't done anything, yet you say I've committed heinous acts and will face retribution."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said, "If this prince truly did something..."</p><p>Without giving it a second thought, Jiang Juan replied, "Of course not. Prince, you're so good; there's no way you could have done anything heinous. You're just making things up."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Jiang Juan said, "Besides, I spend every day with you. What kind of person is Prince? I know better than anyone."</p><p>The palace lanterns swayed, the youth's face fair and delicate. The firelight made him almost translucent, his gaze as clear as if untainted by any impurity.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his expression darkening slightly, "You spend every day with this king, yet you are so good at deceiving and yet so stupid. If this king wanted to hide something from you, how would you discover it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Why is the king like this.</p><p>He had kindly tried to comfort him, only to be called stupid in return.</p><p>Jiang Juan was even more unhappy, "You are stupid, you are utterly stupid."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You are not stupid. Then tell me, why did this king become the crown prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan vaguely had an answer, but he was unsure if it was just his imagination. After hesitating, Jiang Juan shook his head and asked, "Why?"</p><p>"Because of you."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke each word clearly, "You are always afraid, this king does not know what you are afraid of. There is nothing to be afraid of, but... since you are afraid, it means you feel that this king cannot protect you, so this king can only give you peace of mind."</p><p>"You do not even know this and still say you are not stupid?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, "I..."</p><p>He should have rebutted, he should have said that he knew, but Jiang Juan opened his mouth and nothing came out. He slowly furrowed his brow, looked at Xue Fangli for a long time, and said blankly, "Your Highness, why are you so good to me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled carelessly, "Even this you have to ask this king?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not speak. He first shook his head, then nodded. His mind was also in turmoil, so he could only silently watch Xue Fangli.</p><p>The youth's expression was innocent, and Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time, feeling extremely furious. He pinched the soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face, "This king kisses you, this king bites you, every day this king wishes to eat you up, yet you come to ask why this king is so good to you?"</p><p>"What more is there to why?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said with ill will, "It's natural… This King admires you."</p><p>"This King didn't say anything; I was just afraid of scaring you. I wanted to take things slowly with you, but it ended up taking so long. We've kissed and hugged, yet you're asking why this King treats you so well."</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyes were dark as pitch. "And what about you? Why did you kiss This King?"</p><p>He asked too directly, causing Jiang Juan's heart to skip a beat. His gaze darted around wildly. "You were the one who wanted to kiss me. I just… just forgot to push you away."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him expressionlessly. After a long time, he sneered, "Forgot to push you away."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't speak again; he simply put Jiang Juan down from his embrace. Before Jiang Juan could ask anything, he was suddenly pulled by someone. His back pressed against the artificial mountain, Xue Fangli lowered his head and kissed him without hesitation.</p><p>This kiss was different from the brief taste before; it lacked the tenderness and probing of the previous one.</p><p>Jiang Juan's almost blind trust had once made Xue Fangli feel comforted and pleased, but at this moment, it only filled him with panic and an endless sense of agitation.</p><p>——He wasn't really a good person, and he wasn't sure if the teenager would accept his true self.</p><p>He kissed fiercely, his lips and tongue prying open Jiang Juan's mouth. Xue Fangli roughly rubbed Jiang Juan's waist, plundering his mouth like a conqueror.</p><p>"Y-your highness…"</p><p>Jiang Juan felt pain and could hardly breathe. He didn't like this kiss, but he sharply sensed that the prince was in a bad mood and did nothing, only obediently letting him kiss him.</p><p>But it hurt too much; his lips were savagely bitten several times, even his tongue forcefully held in Xue Fangli's mouth. Jiang Juan could bear the pain to be kissed, but he couldn't stop the tears from falling.</p><p>Tears wetted his eyelashes and silently rolled down. He looked pitiful, his eyes red around the corners, and his nose tip also reddened, but Jiang Juan showed no sign of resistance throughout.</p><p>This wetness finally touched Xue Fangli, causing him to pause his actions. He let Jiang Juan go, but unlike before when he would comfort Jiang Juan in his arms if he saw him cry, he only asked indifferently, "Why didn't you push away This King?"</p><p>"Pushed until I had no strength to push away this prince, you can still bite me."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Did you lose the strength to bite because you were kissed so much?"</p><p>"Or… did you forget?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head and gathered her courage to say, "Prince, I… didn’t want to push you away."</p><p>He thought Xue Fangli would be angry, but since he was just being stubborn, Jiang Juan tried to soothe him, "Prince, don’t be mad."</p><p>"Last time, I didn’t forget about pushing away either. I wanted to kiss you."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids as if listening to his explanation, yet it seemed like he didn’t care.</p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Juan licked her kissed-red lips. To prove that she really wanted to kiss him, Jiang Juan initiated a kiss by wrapping her arms around Xue Fangli’s neck and naively pressing her lips to his.</p>
