						<p>Jiang Juan fell into silence.</p><p>Not long after, the grandfather led someone in. Jiang Juan glanced at Jiang Nian and then lowered her head, making an effort to reduce her presence.</p><p>Xue Fuying misunderstood the situation and asked Jiang Juan with a smile, "Are you going to eat crabs?"</p><p>Jiang Juan let out an "ah," only then noticing a steaming basket in front of her, containing several cooked crabs that were a bright red.</p><p>Jiang Juan quite enjoyed eating crabs, but they were rather cumbersome to consume. She was about to shake her head when Xue Fuying had already picked one crab for her and said, "Try it."</p><p>"These are blue crabs, perfect for April. The meat is sweet and fresh, the fat is fragrant."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt tempted, but just looking at them made her feel too lazy to move. Laziness overpowered her hunger as she moved her chopsticks a few times before raising her head again. She hadn't noticed that Su Feiyue had been watching her the whole time. Su Feiyue asked her, "Why not eat?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "N... "</p><p>It wasn't good to say she didn't want to eat, and it was also no good to admit she was too lazy. After some thought, Jiang Juan replied solemnly, "I can't eat them."</p><p>Jiang Nian happened to walk in at that moment, glanced at the crabs in Jiang Juan's bowl, and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Indeed, they were from the countryside.</p><p>What a shame.</p><p>Such an answer seemed to have taken Su Feiyue and Xue Fuying by surprise. They stood there for a while until Su Feiyue stretched out her clearly visible bones and took the crabs from Jiang Juan's bowl. Jiang Juan hurriedly said, "Your Highness, crabs are cold in nature; you shouldn't eat too many."</p><p>Xue Fangli moved slowly and deliberately as she retrieved the scissors without looking up and said, "Fine."</p><p>Su Feiyue and Xue Fuying exchanged a glance before each picking a crab from the basket.</p><p>For a moment, no one spoke at the table. Jiang Nian walked forward and bowed respectfully: "Jiang Nian pays respects to Princess Chang, Sir Jiafu, King Li, and Lady Li."</p><p>The words died away, leaving behind a profound silence.</p><p>Jiang Nian knelt by the side, remaining silent throughout. No one spoke to him, nor did anyone help him rise. Due to Princess Chang's scolding before the banquet, Jiang Nian dared not lift his head on his own. However, he was not surprised by this situation.</p><p>Princess Chang and her husband must have deliberately ignored him and treated him coldly.</p><p>After all, they favored Jiang Juan more, but now that Marquis Consort had canceled their engagement privately and requested the Emperor's blessing for another marriage, it made sense that Princess Chang and her husband would be furious.</p><p>In reality, this was not just true for Jiang Nian.</p><p>Jiang Juan also felt that Princess Chang and her husband were giving the main character a cold reception. After all, they disliked seeing the main character as an antagonist.</p><p>With no one speaking, Jiang Nian remained kneeling, showing no signs of resentment on his face. He behaved extremely humbly, trying to reduce any ill feelings towards him in front of Princess Chang and her husband.</p><p>It was unclear how long he had been kneeling before his legs began to feel numb. Finally, he heard someone talking at the table.</p><p>"Eat it."</p><p>Xue Fuying pushed a small dish towards Jiang Juan, having already cracked and chopped open the crab shell, revealing the red shell within, where the crab meat and roe spilt out.</p><p>At the same time, Su Feiyue also handed over the well-prepared crab to Jiang Juan. He glanced at the dish Xue Fuying had pushed towards him and smiled at Jiang Juan, saying, "Eat one, eat two, since you haven't eaten before, have another one."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He looked at Su Feiyue and Xue Fuying, then lowered his head to look at the prepared crab, falling into a deep state of confusion.</p><p>So they weren't deliberately ignoring the main character?</p><p>They were just busy preparing crabs for him and forgot about the main character?</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>If he were to hold a grudge, it would not be unjust.</p><p>But eating crabs and having someone peel them for him was truly delightful.</p><p>Jiang Juan bit the chopsticks tightly, feeling extremely complex. Suddenly, his face was pinched, forcing him to spit out the chopsticks. The person then took advantage of the situation to feed him a mouthful of crab meat.</p><p>Jiang Juan chewed a few times; the crab meat was indeed very sweet and fresh. Without turning back, he knew it must have been the Prince feeding him, as the Prince was quite enthusiastic about feeding him.</p><p>At that moment, it was indeed Xue Fangli. He looked at Xue Fuying and Su Feiyue peeling crabs for Jiang Juan without making a sound, then moved away silently. Only then did he take the peeled crab meat, dip it in vinegar, and feed it to Jiang Juan.</p><p>The crabs were too delicious, with someone peeling them and another feeding him, Jiang Juan struggled for less than two seconds before lying down.</p><p>Being remembered with resentment was fine; respecting food was most important.</p><p>At that moment, Jiang Nian also reacted.</p><p>Jiang Juan said he couldn't eat crabs, but even Jie Ma and the Princess showed no disdain at all, even peeling crabs for him personally so he could taste them.</p><p>Why were they so good to Jiang Juan?</p><p>The engagement was like this; compared to himself, they preferred Jiang Juan, and they still did now. He had been kneeling for such a long time, but neither the Princess nor Jie Ma called him up, simply because they were peeling crabs and forgot about him.</p><p>What made Jiang Juan better than he was?</p><p>Did Jiang Juan somehow deserve more attention?</p><p>When it came to the engagement, Jiang Nian had asked Secretary Jiang before, even though he already knew the reason, the attitude of the Princess and Jie Ma towards Jiang Juan still made Jiang Nian jealous. He always felt that Jiang Juan did not deserve it.</p><p>——Jiang Juan only benefited from his grandfather's good fortune; his grandfather had happened to save Jie Ma's life.</p><p>Jiang Nian deeply inhaled to calm himself, while at the same time, Su Feiyue just managed to get someone to bring Jiang Nian forward. He looked up and said, "You are the Young Master of the Secretary's Residence?"</p><p>Jiang Nian: "My father, Jiang You."</p><p>Su Feiyue hummed in response, and Xue Fuying glanced over, then exclaimed, "How could it be you?"</p><p>Jiang Nian's heart skipped a beat. As expected, Xue Fuying's next words were, "I remember you. Back then, during the ceremony, you were gazing around like a fool, completely ignorant of the etiquette."</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled and said nonchalantly, "According to what I've heard, he is kind, gentle, and dignified. But indeed, no matter how kind and gentle one is, it's all superficial, just as you say."</p><p>Xue Fuying spoke bluntly, expressing her dislike for him. Jiang Nian wanted to defend himself but thought about Xue Fuying and the Princess not liking him in the first place, so he remained silent and endured the insult.</p><p>This was indeed the first time someone had evaluated him like this; it would be impossible to remain completely indifferent.</p><p>If they hadn't raised Duke of Anping, if Duke of Anping hadn't valued them...</p><p>Jiang Nian suppressed his dissatisfaction and said slowly, "Xue Fuying is right. I have certainly done many things poorly, so I cannot claim to be kind or dignified."</p><p>Su Feiyue nodded when she heard this. "You think you've done many things poorly? Have you really thought about it? What exactly are these faults of yours? Tell me."</p><p>Jiang Nian was taken aback; he couldn't pinpoint them, but it was mere modesty. He believed that even if his intentions weren't pure, there wasn't anything seriously wrong.</p><p>However, with Xue Fuying asking, Jiang Nian could only say humbly, "I haven't fully learned the etiquette."</p><p>"Not fully learned," Su Feiyue repeated, smiling, "Not fully learned?"</p><p>"You don't understand etiquette at all!"</p><p>Su Feiyue suddenly challenged him, "In marriage, one should follow parents' orders and matchmakers' arrangements. But you privately agreed to marry Zhào Shí, is that what you mean by not understanding etiquette?"</p><p>Jiang Nian had anticipated this question and composed himself before answering softly, "We were supposed to seek permission from our seniors, but at that time, neither Xue Fuying nor the Princess was in the capital. We... couldn't help ourselves."</p><p>"What a noble reason," Su Feiyue said. "I'll ask you three questions."</p><p>"Who is Jiang Juan to you?"</p><p>"... My brother."</p><p>"What is the relationship between Zhao Shi and him?"</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyelashes twitched, and he explained: "Fuchai, when the Marquis of Anping pledged to break off our engagement at the time we fell in love, I agreed to it."</p><p>Su Feiyue remained unmoved, merely snorting. "Pledged to break off your engagement. That means you were clear about his marriage status."</p><p>Jiang Nian froze, reluctantly nodding his head. "Jiang Nian is aware, but..."</p><p>Su Feiyue did not listen to him explain. "Third question. How could you be clear about the fact that your brother Jiang Juan has an engagement with Zhao Shi, who is infatuated with you, and yet show no reluctance?"</p><p>Jiang Nian laughed bitterly: "I have shown reluctance before. But no matter how reluctant I am, having known Marquis of Anping for many years, I can't be overly cold-hearted. It's destined that he and Jiang Nian cannot be together, but we are still friends."</p><p>Su Feiyue spoke slowly and deliberately: "Shown reluctance? Do you mean by going out boating with him today and inviting him to go on an outing tomorrow? Zhao Shi says it was his doing; all the blame is on him. I don't agree."</p><p>"He harbors ill intentions, yet you deliberately seduced him!"</p><p>Su Feiyue left no room for emotion, saying everything clearly.</p><p>In fact, regarding the relationship between Marquis of Anping, Jiang Juan, and Jiang Nian, Jiang Nian had always told himself the same story.</p><p>He did avoid—Marquis of Anping would often invite him, but he wouldn't go every time. After rejecting him too many times, Marquis of Anping became dejected, so out of consideration for his friend's feelings, Jiang Nian invited him again.</p><p>He didn't do it unwillingly; rather, he didn't want Marquis of Anping to be frowning all the time.</p><p>As for Jiang Juan and the engagement between Marquis of Anping and Jiang Juan—Marquis of Anping was infatuated with him. Marquis of Anping may have promised to break off his engagement with Jiang Juan, but he did nothing wrong. He didn't do anything inappropriate or out of bounds.</p><p>But today, these lofty justifications were mercilessly torn apart by Fuchai's harsh words. The phrase "deliberately seduced" rang in his ears, and Jiang Nian felt as if he had been slapped hard!</p><p>"Kind, gentle, and dignified," Su Feiyue repeated the words used by Duke Ping to describe Jiang Nian: "With such an evil heart, do you deserve it?"</p><p>From start to finish, Su Feiyue did not utter a single vulgar word. Jiang Nian heard it all, yet felt every word like a sharp blade piercing his heart.</p><p>He had originally thought no one would discover this little trick, but it was exposed just like that, and he could bear nothing more than being disgraced before the entire world.</p><p>"Seducing your younger brother's fiancé, Secretary Jiang truly raised a good son!"</p><p>Su Feiyue said: "In your Secretary's residence, your father favors you, not properly nurturing you. Now, it will be up to this outsider to do so—you stole your brother's fiancé; have you ever apologized to him?"</p><p>Jiang Nian paled at these words and nearly collapsed.</p><p>Having lost his fiancé, Jiang Juan, who was currently being fed by the Prince, choked. He had not expected such a scolding from Su Feiyue, who demanded an apology.</p><p>Xue Fangli remained indifferent to this farce; after all, it was truly an act of kindness for Duke Ping to call off their engagement. Throughout, he had been feeding crabs to Jiang Juan without sparing him even one glance.</p><p>Jiang Juan choked, and Xue Fangli gently patted his back as he said coolly: "No one is stealing your fiancé; what are you so anxious about?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was not anxious; he was terrified.</p><p>Su Feiyue's words were truly harsh, and after this barrage of humiliation, he still demanded an apology from the main character. Jiang Juan felt that today, the protagonist would certainly hold a grudge against him for at least three things.</p><p>Even though the crabs were delicious, Jiang Juan could not help but frown; subconsciously, he moved closer to Xue Fangli, who gave him more of a sense of security.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and slowly lifted his head.</p><p>Jiang Nian knelt on the ground, trembling all over as if he could no longer bear any more damage and would faint at any moment.</p><p>This young master of the Secretary's residence had grand ambitions but lacked cunning; in the end, he was just stupid. What was he so afraid of?</p><p>A faint fragrance of medicinal herbs drifted by, and Xue Fangli stopped looking at Jiang Nian and resumed his gaze downward. The youth clung to him, his hands lightly gripping his sleeves. Forced to apologize was Jiang Nian, but Xue Fangli also seemed somewhat bewildered.</p><p>"Kind, gentle, and dignified," Su Feiyue repeated the words used by Duke Ping to describe Jiang Nian: "With such an evil heart, do you deserve it?"</p><p>Throughout, Su Feiyue did not use a single vulgar word. Jiang Nian heard each word as if they were sharp blades piercing his heart.</p><p>He had always thought no one would discover this trick, but it was exposed in front of the entire world, and he could not bear the disgrace.</p><p>"Seducing your younger brother's fiancé, Secretary Jiang truly raised a good son!"</p><p>Su Feiyue said: "In your Secretary's residence, your father favored you without properly nurturing you.

The youth clung to him, his hands lightly gripping his sleeves. Forced to apologize was Jiang Nian, but Xue Fangli also seemed somewhat bewildered.</p><p>He glanced at Jiang Juan for a few seconds before pulling him into his arms and sitting Jiang Juan on his lap. </p><p>While it was fine to behave this way in the Prince's Mansion or Chengde Hall, this was the Princess Dowager's residence, where both the Marquis and the Princess Dowager were elders, not to mention the many people present. Jiang Juan pushed Sch Fa Li a few times, "Your Highness, I can sit by myself."</p><p>Sch Fa Li glanced at him, "You're seeking comfort in my arms, but then you say you want to sit by yourself?"</p><p>Seeking comfort was purely an involuntary action, and Jiang Juan refused to admit it, "I didn't seek comfort in your arms."</p><p>Sch Fa Li no longer spoke; instead, he picked up a cup of wine and offered it to him, "Osmanthus-flavored wine, would you like to try some?"</p><p>It sounded sweet just by the sound of it, and Jiang Juan was tempted. However, recalling what happened after drinking too much last time, he suppressed his desire and shook his head, "No thank you, Your Highness, please let me go."</p><p>Sch Fa Li's brow furrowed in disappointment as he looked at Jiang Juan but did not release him. Jiang Juan lifted his head to look at him, and Sch Fa Li grabbed him by the face.</p><p>"…Let go of me quickly."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke softly, but even so, being with Sch Fu Ying and Su Fei Yue made them notice their movements. Sch Fu Ying turned her head and was immediately shocked.</p><p>——At that moment, Jiang Juan sat in his nephew's arms, which was bad enough, but he actually reached out to pinch his nephew's face!</p><p>To Sch Fu Ying, given Sch Fa Li's temper, Jiang Juan might not be able to keep both hands free. She hurriedly asked, "What is going on?"</p><p>Jiang Juan felt embarrassed and couldn't say that the Prince didn't want to hold him; since the Prince insisted on holding him, he could only shake his head slowly and say, "…Nothing much."</p><p>Since it had already been noticed, Sch Fu Ying didn't ask further questions, and Jiang Juan stopped struggling. However, he would remember this, so he pinched Sch Fa Li's hand quickly and pulled back.</p><p>Sch Fu Ying was startled, afraid that Sch Fa Li would react immediately. She lightly bumped into Su Fei Yue, who frowned as well. Seeing Sch Fa Li grab the hand that had pinched him,</p><p>he moved slowly to rub it a few times before carelessly asking Jiang Juan, "Does this hurt? Is your finger sore?"</p><p>Su Fei Yue: "?"</p><p>Xue Fu Ying: "???"</p><p>The two of them exchanged glances, recalling what had just happened, and then they saw surprise in each other's eyes.</p><p>—Could it be that their nephew, when his concubine pinched him, was actually afraid that her pinch would hurt more than a finger?</p><p>Su Fei Yue: "..."</p><p>Xue Fu Ying: "............"</p><p>This seemed unlikely to happen to Xue Fang Li. However, it did indeed happen.</p><p>The feast returned to silence once again, except for Jiang Juan's low whisper, "How could it hurt?"</p><p>Xue Fang Li laughed softly, "Who pinched you? Glass is made like that, it breaks with a touch and cries out when the wind blows."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "You are making things up. I didn't feel anything."</p><p>Xue Fang Li did not respond further but started to gently rub Jiang Juan's finger one after another. Jiang Nian glanced over, sneering inwardly.</p><p>If he were ignorant of etiquette, then what about Jiang Juan?</p><p>In such a situation, sitting in the emperor's arms and being affectionate with him was completely inappropriate. Shouldn't she be considered lowly instead?</p><p>He would definitely hear what the horse would say.</p><p>Not long after, Su Fei Yue indeed spoke up without any displeasure in her voice, "You acting this way makes me feel much more at ease."</p><p>Xue Fu Ying nodded lightly as well. She looked at Jiang Juan and sincerely said, "I was initially worried that you might be bullied, considering how I had promised your grandfather to take good care of you, but it turned out like this."</p><p>Xue Fang Li's tone remained cool, "This emperor bully him? How could this emperor dare to bully him when he is the one bullying this emperor?"</p><p>Xue Fu Ying smiled, "You've bullied so many people, it's time someone taught you a lesson."</p><p>Jiang Juan, however, found it amusing, "Was there ever a time I bullied you?"</p><p>Scholar Xue Fang Li raised his eyebrows, "Did this king take your hand and pinch you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up, "...That doesn't count."</p><p>Whether it counted or not was irrelevant; what mattered was that Jiang Juan's behavior hadn't upset Scholar Xue Fang Li. He even seemed quite tolerant. Regardless, Xue Fu Ying and Su Fei Yue did indeed feel a bit more at ease.</p><p>But no matter how things unfolded, someone should still apologize to him, Su Fei Yue smiled, then looked to one side, only to meet with Jiang Nian's unwavering gaze.</p><p>He had seen countless people in his lifetime and understood this look.</p><p>Jealousy, resentment, anger.</p><p>Jiang Nian hastily lowered his head. Su Fei Yue found it even more annoying, her tone tinged with impatience, "Young Master, how should you apologize for this long period?"</p><p>He couldn't apologize.</p><p>If he apologized, it would mean acknowledging that Scholar Xue Fang Li's daughter and Duke Anping had entered into a marriage agreement with Jiang Juan. Not only would he not avoid suspicion, but he would also use friendship as an excuse to repeatedly approach her, even... deliberately seduce her.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his fists. He couldn't acknowledge it.</p><p>In his previous life, he had adhered to propriety and died in sorrow. Could he not follow his heart in this life?</p><p>Heaven had given him another chance; wasn't that precisely to make up for the regrets of his past life?</p><p>Silence reigned supreme.</p><p>Su Fei Yue asked him, "Well, are you not going to apologize?"</p><p>Xue Fu Ying smiled, "You've bullied so many people; it's time someone taught you a lesson."</p><p>Jiang Juan, however, found this amusing. "Was there ever a time I bullied you?"</p><p>Scholar Xue Fang Li raised his eyebrows. "Did this king take your hand and pinch you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up. "...That doesn't count."</p><p>Whether or not it counted was irrelevant; what mattered was that Jiang Juan's actions had not upset Scholar Xue Fang Li, who even seemed quite tolerant of him. Nevertheless, Xue Fu Ying and Su Fei Yue did feel a bit more at ease.</p><p>Still, no matter how things went for Jiang Juan, someone should apologize to him. Su Fei Yue smiled but then looked sideways, meeting Jiang Nian's unwavering gaze.</p><p>Having seen countless people in his lifetime, he understood this look well.</p><p>Jealousy, resentment, anger.</p><p>Jiang Nian hastily lowered his head. Su Fei Yue found it even more annoying and her tone became slightly impatient. "Young Master, how should you apologize for this long period?"</p><p>He couldn't apologize.</p><p>If he did, it would mean acknowledging that Scholar Xue Fang Li's daughter and Duke Anping had entered into a marriage agreement with Jiang Juan. Not only would this not avoid suspicion, but it would also imply using friendship as an excuse to repeatedly approach her, even... deliberately seduce her.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his fists. He couldn't admit that.</p><p>In his previous life, he had adhered strictly to propriety and died in sorrow. Could he not follow his heart in this life?</p><p>Heaven had given him another chance; wasn't it to make up for the regrets of his past life?</p><p>Silence reigned supreme.</p><p>Su Fei Yue asked him, "Well, are you not going to apologize?"</p><p>Xue Fu Ying smiled, "You've wronged so many people; it's time someone taught you a lesson."</p><p>Jiang Juan found this amusing. "Was there ever a moment I bullied you?"</p><p>Scholar Xue Fang Li raised his eyebrows. "Did this king take your hand and pinch you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up. "...That doesn't count."</p><p>Whether or not it counted was irrelevant; what mattered was that Jiang Juan's actions had not upset Scholar Xue Fang Li, who even seemed quite tolerant of him. Nevertheless, both Xue Fu Ying and Su Fei Yue felt a bit more at ease.</p><p>Still, no matter how things unfolded for Jiang Juan, someone should apologize to him.

Su Fei Yue saw this and her expression grew colder and colder. On their side, Jiang Juan sank further into despair at the beginning. Xue Fang Li lowered his eyes to look at him for a few seconds; he originally had no intention of getting involved but ended up doing so.</p><p>Why is he so scared?</p><p>Even if I tell him not to be afraid, the youth was still afraid. He had to stand up for him.</p><p>Xue Fang Li lazily opened his mouth, "Young Master, this king advises you to apologize."</p><p>Xue Fang Li said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, "If it weren't for Ji Ma's reminder, I would have forgotten to make you apologize. He is engaged to the Marquis, which I don't care about, but since you spoke so many bad things about him in front of me, you should at least apologize."</p><p>He slowly said, "I had repeatedly warned you before; today, I will finally settle accounts with you for all this."</p><p>"Speaking of that, does the Marquis know that the person you admire is actually——"</p><p>"Your Highness!"</p><p>In that instant, Jiang Nian's heart almost stopped beating. He did not want to apologize, nor was he willing to do so, but Xue Fang Li directly hit on his deepest secret.</p><p>The fact that he admired Duke Li, he would never admit and did not wish for anyone to know.</p><p>"I apologize."</p><p>Jiang Nian gritted his teeth and said word by word, "Jiang Nian is willing to apologize."</p><p>No matter how unwilling and resistant he was, Jiang Nian could not help but look at Jiang Juan seated above.
