						<p>Jiang Juan didn't say anything, and he was lying in Xue Fangli's arms. The more he thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt, and his tears almost never stopped.</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a bland tone, "There's nothing to cry for. These things, this king has long stopped caring about."</p><p>Long stopped caring didn't mean he didn't care at all. Jiang Juan raised his head and said seriously, "Your Highness, please care about me in the future."</p><p>The King is truly pitiful, with an unhappy family and a tragic background, and he doesn't have much time left.</p><p>Jiang Juan originally intended to symbolically operate, do some terminal care for Your Highness, but now he changed his mind.</p><p>He wanted to be kinder to the king, and properly see him off on his last journey.</p><p>Jiang Juan added, "I will take good care of you."</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed not to expect Jiang Juan to say such things. He lowered his head and stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before slowly opening his mouth, "What if you regret it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked in confusion, "What would I regret?"</p><p>"Because..."</p><p>Pale fingers touched Jiang Juan's face, and Xue Fangli repeatedly wiped away each of Jiang Juan's tears, then slowly said, "You cry too much."</p><p>Pain makes one cry, feeling others' suffering makes one cry, anything can make one cry.</p><p>Eventually, Jiang Juan realized he had been deceived—he wasn't a good person, but a madman who liked to bring suffering to others. What would happen if he cried?</p><p>The sky was going to collapse, right?</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "I..."</p><p>Distinctive knuckles pressed against his lips. Xue Fangli looked at him, and his rosy lips lightly curled up. He said gently, "Do not make any promises to this king."</p><p>"The King took it seriously. Even if you can't do it, you must."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. Someone pressed his neck from behind, and he leaned back into Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>This time, he was very quiet and didn't cry anymore. However, Jiang Juan was also tired, and soon fell asleep in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Xue Fangli, however, still had one arm around Jiang Juan, looking down at him for a long time.</p><p>His heart softened completely, almost breaking.</p><p>The next evening.</p><p>The memorial ceremony for the peonies was over. The carriage of the Wangfu left Miaolin Temple.</p><p>Jiang Juan had been in low spirits most of yesterday, but today he felt quite good. He sat in Xue Fangli's arms, resigned to being a human cushion and eating whatever was offered.</p><p>"Are you going shopping anymore?"</p><p>Suddenly, Xue Fangli stopped speaking. Jiang Juan was stunned and looked up at him blankly. Xue Fangli raised his chin slightly, gesturing for him to look outside.</p><p>"You said last time that you wanted to go shopping on this street."</p><p>"We'll shop."</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered now. He actually didn't like window-shopping; it was too tiring. However, since coming into the book, Jiang Juan had only experienced a limited number of plots. He was quite curious about other worlds and wanted to explore.</p><p>Xue Fangli said "Hmm," instructing the driver to stop the carriage. He then said, "This King will wait for you at the teahouse."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes. "Won't the Prince go together?"</p><p>If he went along, Jiang Juan wouldn't have much to look at, after all, Wang Wei was far away. However, Xue Fangli replied, "This King prefers quietness."</p><p>"The King took it seriously. Even if you can't do it, you must."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. Someone pressed his neck from behind, and he leaned back into Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>This time, he was very quiet and didn't cry anymore. However, Jiang Juan was also tired and soon fell asleep in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Xue Fangli still had one arm around Jiang Juan, gazing at him for a long time.</p><p>His heart softened completely, almost breaking.</p><p>The following evening.</p><p>The memorial ceremony for the peonies was over, and the Wangfu carriage departed from Miaolin Temple.</p><p>Although Jiang Juan had been in low spirits most of yesterday, he felt quite good today. He sat in Xue Fangli's arms, resigned to being a human cushion and eating whatever was offered.</p><p>"Are you going shopping anymore?"</p><p>Xue Fangli suddenly fell silent. Jiang Juan looked up at him blankly as Xue Fangli raised his chin slightly, gesturing for him to look outside.</p><p>"You said last time that you wanted to go shopping on this street."</p><p>"We'll shop."</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered now. He actually didn't like window-shopping; it was too tiring. However, since coming into the book, Jiang Juan had experienced only a limited number of plots and was quite curious about other worlds, wanting to explore.</p><p>Xue Fangli said "Hmm," instructing the driver to stop the carriage. He then said, "This King will wait for you at the teahouse."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes. "Won't the Prince go together?"</p><p>If he went along, Jiang Juan wouldn't have much to look at, after all, Wang Wei was far away. However, Xue Fangli replied, "This King prefers quietness."</p><p>"The King took it seriously; even if you can't manage, you must."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned as someone pressed his neck from behind, causing him to lean back into Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>This time, he remained silent and didn't cry. Jiang Juan himself was exhausted and soon fell asleep in Xue Fangli's embrace.</p><p>Xue Fangli, with one arm still around Jiang Juan, gazed at him for a long while, his heart softening to the point of breaking.</p><p>The following evening arrived.</p><p>The memorial ceremony for the peonies concluded as the Wangfu carriage departed from Miaolin Temple.</p><p>Though Jiang Juan had been despondent most of yesterday, he felt quite well today. He sat in Xue Fangli's arms, content to be a human cushion and eating whatever was offered.</p><p>"Are you going shopping anymore?"</p><p>Xue Fangli abruptly fell silent, leaving Jiang Juan looking up at him blankly. Xue Fangli raised his chin slightly, gesturing for him to look outside.</p><p>"You mentioned last time that you wanted to browse this street."</p><p>"We'll shop," Jiang Juan recalled. He actually didn't enjoy aimless wandering; it was too tiring. However, since entering the book, Jiang Juan had experienced only a limited number of plots and was quite curious about other worlds, eager to explore.</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a simple "Hmm" before instructing the driver to stop the carriage. He then said, "This King will wait for you at the teahouse."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes in surprise. "Won't the Prince accompany you?"</p><p>If Xue Fangli went along, Jiang Juan wouldn't have much to see, as Wang Wei was far away. However, Xue Fangli replied, "This King prefers quietness."</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered an "oh" without much suspicion, after all, the maidservants usually didn't make a sound; they did everything quietly. "I'll come find you once I'm done."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded. Jiang Juan got up from his arms and just as she touched the curtain,, Xue Fangli said, "Wait."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around, "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli summoned a high official and gave him some orders in a casual tone. The official glanced at Jiang Juan and left; when he returned, he was holding a hood.</p><p>Xue Fangli put it on her and added, "Go now."</p><p>The brim of the hood was wide, the light silk reaching to her waist. Jiang Juan pulled it back slightly and asked curiously, "Prince Wang, why am I wearing this?"</p><p>The hood billowed up, revealing half of the handsome young man's face, already beautiful beyond comparison. Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and calmly said, "It’s hot outside; you can't bear getting sunburned."</p><p>That made sense; Jiang Juan really didn’t want to get hurt anymore. He sincerely said, "Prince Wang, your consideration is so thorough."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and asked, "Is that so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and put the hood back on before getting out of the carriage.</p><p>Xue Fangli naturally wouldn't let him wander around alone; many guards followed, though not in such a grand manner. Jiang Juan looked here and there but found nothing particularly interesting until he stepped into a bookstore.</p><p>"…This black glazed cup is expensive. This kind of black porcelain can no longer be produced, let alone this one which is yao bian, extremely valuable."</p><p>The shop owner carefully lifted a teacup; it was entirely black with several brown spots on the bottom. It seemed ordinary at first glance, but when tilted slightly, a faint blue glow appeared, sparkling like stars in a bowl.</p><p>Jiang Juan was amazed, and those around him weren't any less impressed. Someone asked, "Shop owner, are you selling this cup?"</p><p>"Not for sale, no matter how much silver," the shop owner put the cup away, "However…"</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered an "oh" without much suspicion, after all, the maidservants usually didn't make a sound; they did everything quietly. "I'll come find you once I'm done."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded. Jiang Juan got up from his arms and just as she touched the curtain, Xue Fangli said, "Wait."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around, "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli summoned a high official and gave him some orders in a casual tone. The official glanced at Jiang Juan and left; when he returned, he was holding a hood.</p><p>Xue Fangli put it on her and added, "Go now."</p><p>The brim of the hood was wide, the light silk reaching to her waist.

"I will come find you once I finish."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded his head in acknowledgment. Jiang Juan rose from his position beside Xue Fangli and just as she reached out to touch the curtain, Xue Fangli called out, "Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around curiously, her confusion evident in her voice, "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli summoned a high-ranking official and gave him some orders with a casual tone. The official took a glance at Jiang Juan before leaving; when he returned, he was holding a hood.</p><p>Xue Fangli placed the hood over Jiang Juan's head and stated, "Go now."</p><p>The brim of the hood was wide, and the light silk reached her waist. Jiang Juan pulled it back slightly and asked with curiosity, "Prince Wang, why am I wearing this?"</p><p>The hood billowed up, revealing half of the handsome young man's face, already beautiful beyond comparison. Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said calmly, "It’s hot outside; you can't bear getting sunburned."</p><p>That made sense to Jiang Juan, who really didn’t want to get hurt anymore. She sincerely said, "Prince Wang, your consideration is so thorough."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled at her words and asked, "Is that so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded in agreement and pulled the hood back on before getting out of the carriage.</p><p>Xue Fangli, naturally, wouldn't let Jiang Juan wander around alone; many guards followed him, though not in a grand manner. Jiang Juan looked around but found nothing particularly interesting until she stepped into a bookstore.</p><p>"…This black glazed cup is very expensive.

It seemed ordinary at first glance, but when tilted slightly, a faint blue glow appeared, sparkling like stars in a bowl.</p><p>Jiang Juan was amazed, and those around her weren't any less impressed. Someone asked, "Shop owner, are you selling this cup?"</p><p>"Not for sale, no matter how much silver," the shop owner put the cup away. However,</p><p>He sold a favor, “Our master is a poetry enthusiast. This teacup is invaluable, but if someone writes a poem that satisfies him, he might be pleased enough to give it away.”</p><p>Using poetry to exchange for it would not cost much, but writing a good poem was no easy task. Jiang Juan enjoyed it and liked the idea, but he did not particularly want one; just being able to admire it for a while would make him very happy, so Jiang Juan decided to look his fill.</p><p>Unaware of this, someone on the second floor of the bookshop had been watching him for quite some time.</p><p>“Using poetry to exchange? What bad luck, the Duke is here.”</p><p>“You’re right. We can’t write any good poems, but the Duke is different; he can compose verses effortlessly.”</p><p>This bookshop was originally a collection of books by a great scholar, storing various ancient texts. Later, it was opened to scholars in Beijing, with the first floor selling various reproductions and the second floor connected to a tea house, serving as a resting place for scholars who often gathered there.</p><p>Today, Duke Anping was invited to participate in the gathering. He was of high status and had been rumored to have received instruction from Master Bai, so many scholars in Beijing revered him above all others.</p><p>“Gentlemen, you are being too kind,” Duke Anping said calmly, “My poetry is nothing extraordinary.”</p><p>“The Duke should not be modest,” said Li Ming, the Assistant Minister of Punishment, waving his hand, “If it were ordinary, we would have jumped over the moat already.”</p><p>Duke Anping smiled helplessly and changed his mind, saying, “This black porcelain teacup doesn’t catch my eye. I don’t plan to participate.”</p><p>Li Ming heard this and quickly elbowed the person next to him, “Did you hear that? You were just saying you wanted it, if the Duke participates, he will certainly get it easily. Now is your chance.”</p><p>Duke Anping was even more helpless when he heard this, but he did not say anything; instead, he picked up his teacup and took a sip of tea, his gaze then drifted involuntarily to the lower floor.</p><p>The youth wore light-colored clothes, with curtains falling, almost blending into the sheer fabric. Even without seeing his face, one could tell he had an ice-like complexion and a divine beauty.</p><p>“Duke, what are you looking at?” Li Ming followed him down and was taken aback, “This… is Lord Jiang Nian?”</p><p>It’s no wonder he made a mistake. Lord Jiang Nian from the Ministry of Revenue was known as the Little Immortal in Beijing due to his refined demeanor, gentle manner, and elegant appearance; he was also affectionately called the First Beauty.</p><p>Given Duke Anping’s intense gaze and his long-standing friendship with Jiang Nian, Li Ming naturally misinterpreted the scene.</p><p>Hearing him mention Jiang Juan, the Duke of Ping An finally came to his senses. He slowly said, "It's not Xiao Nian, it's San Gong."</p><p>A moment later, he remembered something and said with a grin, "Isn't she divorced from the Wangfei now?"</p><p>They all knew to some extent about Jiang Juan's obsessive love for the Duke of Ping An since they had connections with him. Li Ming was known for his light-hearted nature, so he lowered his voice and said, "My Lord, you visit the bookstore every month. He didn't come early or late, but why did he come today?"</p><p>Li Ming winked, "I bet it's not about the wine."</p><p>The Duke of Ping An frowned, "Speak cautiously."</p><p>Li Ming was familiar with him and knew that he wasn't really angry; they were still joking around. The others joined in and said, "My Lord, why don't you invite the Wangfei up for a cup of tea?"</p><p>The Duke of Ping An was not very supportive and was about to reject outright when Li Ming teased, "Since she's already the Wangfei, she still seeks you out like this. If you don't see her, it would indeed be as cold as iron."</p><p>The Duke of Ping An looked down at Jiang Juan, his gaze suddenly focusing on her bandaged left hand. He finally changed his mind and said, "...Alright."</p><p>He had owed Jiang Juan a lot. Last time in the palace, many things couldn't be discussed openly, but this time he could clarify them.</p><p>The Duke of Ping An called over the servant boy and whispered to him. The servant immediately took orders and went downstairs.</p><p>Watching for a while, Li Ming couldn't help asking the Duke of Ping An, "My Lord, don't you think he has changed a lot? Last time we saw him, he didn't even dare to lift his head, but now..."</p><p>How much? Li Ming didn't finish his sentence. After all, no matter how much she had changed, Jiang Juan was still the divorced Wangfei; it would be disrespectful to say too much.</p><p>——Why did I get so curious about that face under the veil?</p><p>The Duke of Ping An glanced at him and actually understood Li Ming's unfinished thoughts. He faintly remembered that time—Jiang Juan's eyelashes fluttering, her face wet—and his heart stirred as well.</p><p>In the next second, realizing something, the Duke of Ping An slammed down his teacup heavily, "This Duke sees no difference from before."</p><p>"No change, no change, why such a big fuss..." Li Ming muttered a few words and personally poured wine for the Marquis of Anping. "Alright, alright, I was wrong. Come, drink."</p><p>At the same time, the young servant had already come downstairs. He called out to Jiang Juan and whispered, "Madame, the Marquis is inviting you upstairs to chat."</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly turned her head, "Marquis? Which Marquis?"</p><p>The servant laughed, "Could it be any other Marquis? Naturally, the Marquis of Anping."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this happen.</p><p>He came out just to sightsee, and now he ran into the Marquis of Anping.</p><p>The Marquis of Anping played the lead in an offensive role; Jiang Juan naturally avoided him. Moreover, during their last meeting, the Marquis was too clingy, so Jiang Juan didn't want to have anything to do with him. Thus, she shook her head, "I don't think we need to chat."</p><p>"This..." The servant hesitated, "Madame, the Marquis sincerely invited you."</p><p>Jiang Juan earnestly said, "But I truly don't think there's much to talk about. You can just inform the Marquis like that."</p><p>The servant obediently agreed and hurried back. Li Ming, seeing him alone, quipped, "Where is Madame? Could it be she became a little timid upon hearing the Marquis's invitation, wanting to take things slow?"</p><p>The companions also laughed, "Who knows? Madame used to be completely infatuated with the Marquis. This really is the first time he invited her to meet, not her eagerly approaching him."</p><p>The Marquis of Anping glanced at them and stopped them, "Stop saying such things. He has already left Madame. If Lord Li learns about it, he will surely be displeased."</p><p>But in his heart, he didn't think Jiang Juan would refuse to meet him either. Therefore, he asked the servant, "What happened to Madame?"</p><p>The servant bowed down and was about to whisper softly in his ear, but the Marquis of Anping said, "It's fine, just say it directly."</p><p>Xiao Sai said angrily, "Duke Hou..."</p><p>Li Ming put his hand on the man's shoulder, "If you have something to say, go ahead. Why are you hiding what happened with Duchess from everyone? Could it be that Duchess asked you to secretly pass messages to Duke Hou?"</p><p>Everyone burst into laughter. Even Duke of Anping hesitated for a moment, fearing that Jiang Juan might have said something unpleasant that others shouldn't hear.</p><p>Perhaps he was fleeing from Wang's brutality, and sought help.</p><p>Duke of Anping was about to correct himself when Li Ming sighed, "Duke Hou truly enjoys his good fortune. Our top beauty is infatuated with you, and even her brother is smitten with you."</p><p>Duke of Anping paused but said nothing in the end. Xiao Sai gritted his teeth and said, "Duke Hou, Duchess said she has nothing to say to you; he won't see you."</p><p>When his words fell, the room fell silent.</p><p>The more they had cheered before, the more awkward it felt now. None of them expected Jiang Juan to refuse, let alone so bluntly.</p><p>Didn't he adore Duke of Anping?</p><p>Why did he embarrass Duke of Anping like this?</p><p>Li Ming, who had been cheering enthusiastically and was also quite puzzled (though not being Duke of Anping himself), now regretted not helping Duke of Anping out of his predicament.</p><p>Rejecting an invitation in public, especially from someone who never refused before—it was embarrassing, truly humiliating.</p><p>Thinking about this, Li Ming glanced at Duke of Anping. The duke's expression remained unchanged, still calm and composed. Li Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Thankfully, the Duke Hous doesn't care.</p><p>In fact, even an onlooker like Li Ming felt embarrassed; how much more so for Duke of Anping?</p><p>He was rather disgraced, but as someone who kept his emotions in check, nothing showed on his face. Only the hand hidden in his sleeve was tightly clenched.</p><p>Is there nothing to narrate?</p><p>With the best of intentions, even if he harbored resentment, he shouldn't act so heartlessly.</p><p>Duke Ping became increasingly angry as he thought about it. Just then, Li Ming suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "Why are you leaving?"</p><p>Duke Ping instinctively looked over and saw Jiang Juan turn around as if she was about to leave.</p><p>Li Ming quickly seized the opportunity to smooth things over, saying, "If Princess Consort didn't come, there must be something important, otherwise, why wouldn't she stay with Duke?"</p><p>Amidst the chorus of agreement, Duke Ping's anger did not subside. He stared at Jiang Juan for a few moments before abruptly standing up and declaring, "This Duke is going out."</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances but said nothing, only watching as he left.</p><p>However, soon enough, there was a loud "bang" as the door was kicked open again.</p><p>"Duke, why are you…"</p><p>Several guards stood respectfully to one side as a man slowly approached. His skin was extremely pale, except for his lips which were shockingly vivid. He now wore a sinister smile, brimming with malice.</p><p>It was not Duke Ping returning, but King Li who had arrived.</p><p>"I just overheard some rather interesting things in the next room."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and glanced at the approaching Duke Ping, smiling nonchalantly, "How could this King's Princess Consort possibly be interested in others?"</p><p>"You have mouths but only know how to gossip. In this King’s opinion, it would be better to cut off those tongues."</p>
