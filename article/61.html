						<p>What was he afraid of?</p><p>What was he looking for?</p><p>Jiang Juan froze.</p><p>He was afraid that the Prince was not there.</p><p>He was looking for ... the Prince.</p><p>"I ..."</p><p>I am looking for 。。。。</p><p>There were only four words, but Jiang Juan opened his mouth and couldn't say anything.</p><p>The horse 。。。 was running, and the wind was howling fiercely.</p><p>Bang bang bang.</p><p>Jiang Juan heard his heartbeat again, which seemed louder than the wind 。。。 and inexplicably joyful.</p><p>They sat on the horse 。。。， riding across the grassland and over the hills. At this moment, the world was both quiet and noisy.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't speak. Xue Fangli patiently waited for him for a long time before slowly asking, "Why did you open your eyes?"</p><p>He didn't want to say.</p><p>He just didn't want to say.</p><p>Jiang Juan stammered as he replied, "Wasn't it you who made me open my eyes?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and looked at him. The young man's long hair danced in the wind as he sat up stiffly, trying to maintain composure, but his fingers clung tightly to his sleeves.</p><p>A hand emerged from the wide sleeve of his robe, Xue Fangli smiled enigmatically, "Why are you still so stubborn?"</p><p>In the next moment, he gently brushed away Jiang Juan's hand. At that instant, his fingers fell empty, and Jiang Juan lost all sense of security.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Unable to grasp Your Highness's sleeve, the jolts seemed to intensify. Instinctively, Jiang Juan tried to reach out, but Xue Fangli deliberately avoided him. Jiang Juan missed several times and finally clung desperately to the horse.</p><p>"Look."</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli calmly uttered a word. Jiang Juan instinctively lifted his head, only to find himself in an even worse situation.</p><p>A lake.</p><p>They were racing toward a lake.</p><p>The horse galloped at full speed with no intention of stopping, while Xue Fangli remained leisurely and showed no signs of halting.</p><p>Jiang Juan was terrified but tried to reassure himself.</p><p>—No matter what, the horse would never charge into the lake.</p><p>However, the horse ran too fast. They were getting closer and closer to the lake; the air seemed to turn damp until the hooves stepped into the mud, suddenly lowering the horse's body and causing a violent jolt.</p><p>"Your Highness, no, stop!"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't hold it anymore, "Quickly make &#59692;&#8204; stop."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Why should &#61001;&#8204; stop?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said anxiously, "Lake, there's a lake ahead."</p><p>"I know," Xue Fangli said leisurely, "but suddenly I don't want to make &#59692;&#8204; stop. What should we do?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned and looked up at him.</p><p>His disheveled hair stuck to his face, Jiang Juan was genuinely scared. Without realizing it, his long lashes were wet, as if droplets of dew or moisture clung to them, with a hint of redness at the corners of his eyes.</p><p>What could he do?</p><p>What could be done?</p><p>The Prince was deliberately doing this.</p><p>Deliberately pulling down his hand, not allowing him to grab his sleeve again, deliberately galloping towards the lake, not letting the horse stop, and deliberately scaring him.</p><p>Because...</p><p>Because he refused to answer his question properly?</p><p>But that couldn't be right either.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt more wronged as he thought about it. He tried to hold back for a long time, but he could no longer contain himself now. The droplets on his lashes kept falling, and his face was covered in moisture.</p><p>Xue Fangli paused, finally pulling the reins, and the horse snorted a few times before stopping its gallop towards the lake.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan's tears continued to fall.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time, then wrapped his arms around Jiang Juan's waist and pulled her into his embrace. "Don't cry."</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him, tears silently falling onto Xue Fangli's fingers, warm and wet. Xue Fangli lowered his head and gently wiped away Jiang Juan's tears with the pad of his thumb. "It's my fault for scaring you."</p><p>"Not just that... for forcing..."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, but she didn't speak. Xue Fangli pinched her chin and gently lifted her wet face. "Why are you so scared?"</p><p>"I'm afraid of everything, even telling the truth."</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered in defense, "I'm not afraid to tell the truth; it's just that..."</p><p>He was just terribly anxious.</p><p>It was a feeling for Jiang Juan that was extremely unfamiliar and unprecedented.</p><p>Thrilling, exhilarating, filled with many expectations.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt insecure without the prince around. </p><p>He also felt dependent on the prince.</p><p>But there was an instinctive feeling that these hidden emotions should not be explored or revealed.</p><p>He hated change.</p><p>And he feared the unknown.</p><p>"I'm just scared, I just fear."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered her head and softly spoke, "Prince, don't scare me anymore..."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him. The boy seemed like a scared little animal, so listless that he had forgotten how to scratch himself — he, who was used to being favored and pampered, could act on his whims without restraint.</p><p>The boy merely shed tears, pitifully pleading, and the way he spoke sounded as if he were whining, soft and endearing.</p><p>Xue Fangli moved his finger and brushed Jiang Juan's hair, which had been blown into disarray by the wind, behind his ear. He nodded slightly, "Mm, I won't do it again."</p><p>Jiang Juan believed him, "Then we have a deal. You can't scare me anymore, or else..."</p><p>"Or else you'll sleep alone from now on. I won't take care of you," he said.</p><p>It sounded as if he had taken care of Xue Fangli all along, but in reality, it was Jiang Juan who was the one threatening after being cared for.</p><p>Since people teased him and made him cry, Jiang Juan could say whatever he wanted, and Xue Fangli lazily wrapped his arms around him, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan was satisfied.</p><p>But there was something that bothered him. Jiang Juan decided to take revenge.</p><p>He suddenly grabbed Xue Fangli's hand. Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched, looking at Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan asked him sternly, "What are you looking at?"</p><p>—When the Prince didn't let him grab his sleeve just now, he had fiercely grabbed his hand.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze, saying nothing much. He gripped Jiang Juan's hand tightly and parted his lips slightly, "Nothing."</p><p>Jiang Juan was satisfied with his response and solemnly announced, "From now on, I won't pull at your sleeves anymore; I'll use my hands instead."</p><p>It felt more comfortable to grab with his hands and gave him a greater sense of security.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled faintly, "Okay."</p><p>The matter was settled, but Jiang Juan had new troubles.</p><p>— Even with the cushioning, the saddle was still too hard. The skin inside his thighs, being the most delicate, had been rubbed badly as Jiang Juan rode along.</p><p>He didn’t notice it before, but once he dismounted without any issues, Jiang Juan felt pain. He refused to ride again and asked Xue Fangli to let him down.</p><p>This was outside, so Jiang Juan couldn’t check it himself. He said unhappily, "It must be worn through."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Baby."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to defend himself, "I’ve never ridden a horse before."</p><p>They were by the lake, unable to return, so Jiang Juan had no choice but to stay and play there. Following the principle of sitting instead of standing when possible, Jiang Juan sat on the grass and started pulling at the blades of grass with his hands.</p><p>There were quite a few people by the lake; they were all stablehands from the riding ground. Knowing that two important guests had arrived, they bowed respectfully before continuing their work.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud "splash," as if someone had fallen into the water.</p><p>Jiang Juan froze, looked up, and saw a person fall into the lake. The waves crashed against him, pushing him far away, and he sank in the water.</p><p>In such a critical moment, Jiang Juan couldn’t think much. Besides, he was the closest to the person. Instinctively, he crawled to the shore and reached out his hand.</p><p>"Hold me."</p><p>The person in the water stretched out their hand toward him, but they were still a short distance apart. The intense desire for survival made this person struggle forward with all their might, while Jiang Juan moved forward slightly as well.</p><p>After a moment, his hand was finally grabbed.</p><p>Jiang Juan heaved a sigh of relief, but the other hand that had been supporting him on the grass slipped, and he also fell into the water.</p><p>In that instant, Jiang Juan was dazed.</p><p>Fortunately, in the next second, someone quickly pulled him out. Xue Fangli said expressionlessly, "Rescue him."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong was at the royal stables, and his guards were naturally scattered around. Even without Xi Fangli's orders, they would have rescued him—Lady Wang was not just any stablehand; if he fell into the water, of course, she would be the first to come to his rescue.</p><p>The guards jumped into the lake and pulled Jiang Juan forward, while Xi Fangli tugged at him from the front. Soon enough, hands suddenly exerted force, and Jiang Juan was finally pulled in. He wiped off the water from his face and said anxiously, "There's someone in the lake."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the guards naturally leaped to rescue the person. The sound of splashing water filled the air as Jiang Juan sat on the ground, looking around. Suddenly, something hit him hard, and his vision went black, unable to see anything.</p><p>It was a robe.</p><p>Xi Fangli wrapped Jiang Juan in the robe, lifted him up, and placed him on his horseback.</p><p>"…Your Highness?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to pull off the robe, but as soon as he raised his hand, it was pressed down. Xi Fangli reined in the horse, silently holding him close, and the horse galloped away again.</p><p>On their return, the horse ran even faster, like a gust of wind.</p><p>Jiang Juan remained very calm.</p><p>The horse ran fast, but he was held tightly, so Jiang Juan wasn't afraid. However, he sensed something was off—the prince seemed angry—and with hesitation, Jiang Juan didn't remove the robe, staying hidden underneath it.</p><p>He had fallen into the water and was drenched from head to toe—his hair, sleeves, and hem all dripping water as the horse ran, leaving a trail of droplets behind.</p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>Emperor Xinghong was walking with Su Fimei when he noticed the commotion. Wang Tongguan sized up the situation worriedly and said, "Your Majesty, it seems Lady Wang has fallen into the lake."</p><p>"Fallen into the water?" Emperor Xinghong frowned and said, "Quickly summon a few imperial physicians."</p><p>Wang Tongguan took his orders and rushed off. Su Fimei watched the horse gallop away for a long time without regaining his composure. Emperor Xinghong patted him on the shoulder, "Go check what's happening for me."</p><p>Su Fimei was already worried and didn't refuse, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Jiang Juan was carried back into the tent and placed on the bed. "Boil some water," Xue Fangli ordered. Jiang Juan took a deep breath, pulled down his robe slightly, and tried to sneak a peek. However, there was no obstruction in his line of sight, directly facing Xue Fangli's gaze. Jiang Juan had always felt guilty; at this moment, he nearly jumped up. "…Your Highness," unlike his usual mild demeanor, Xue Fangli looked cold and even vicious, quite frightening. Jiang Juan sighed, knowing that the king was angry, so he admitted his mistake proactively: "I'm sorry, I made a mistake." "I should have been more careful not to fall into the water." Xue Fangli pinched his chin, his eyelids lowered, and asked him emotionlessly, "Do you think your mistake is here?" Jiang Juan exclaimed, cautiously asking him, "Is it not?" Pausing for a moment, Jiang Juan whispered in complaint, "It's not my fault. Everything was fine until I grabbed that person, but then my hand slipped…" Xue Fangli glanced at him; even when admitting his mistake, the boy looked innocent. He suppressed the anger in his heart and finally said slowly, "Be more careful?" "Do you know how a thousand-gold son doesn't sit under eaves and a hundred-gold son doesn't ride on crossbeams?" Jiang Juan didn't know and whispered, "I'll learn when I find out, but…" "This is different. What if someone falls into the water and we do nothing about it?" Xue Fangli said calmly, "Who is he? And who are you?"</p><p>Inside the racecourse, guards were everywhere. If Lord Ji had not been there today, he would have drowned. Whether his groom was willing to save him or not, no one would blame him if he died of drowning. These guards did not move an inch because he was just a groom, just a slave, unworthy of mention.</p><p>Jiang Juan froze in shock.</p><p>After a long time, he said dazedly, "Even as a slave, he is still a person; he was just trying to make a living..."</p><p>"Make a living."</p><p>Xue Fali repeated, closing his eyes lightly.</p><p>He did not want to recall that moment again, when Jiang Juan had fallen into the water from the shore—originally observing coldly, at the very instant Jiang Juan reached out his hand, anger surged in his heart. He even thought that the young man loved to meddle and ought to be given some lessons.</p><p>But seeing the young man fall into the water, fear and panic crept into him, a person usually fearless and unafraid.</p><p>"Are you just so fond of meddling?"</p><p>The more panic he felt about losing him, the greater his anger at that moment. Xue Fali's expression darkened as he spoke with light mockery, "Is it because you have a compassionate heart?"</p><p>With that, Xue Fali snorted lightly, "Of course, how could I forget that you are a little Bodhisattva."</p><p>"Slaves are people too; they are just trying to make a living..."</p><p>The savagery deep in his soul raged on, and the waves of anger surged. But Xue Fali could only restrain himself, saying, "Little Bodhisattva, coming down to earth is for saving all beings."</p><p>Outside the tent, Su Feiyue did not know how long he had been listening; he raised his eyebrows in surprise, the smile on his lips deepening.</p>
