						<p>At a glance, his heart was captivated.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared into his eyes, their palms touching—a thin and supple waist, smooth as jade, not even a span in length.</p><p>He almost involuntarily and unconsciously clenched it tightly.</p><p>However, all this vanished at the touch, the warm softness beneath his palm dissipating instantly.</p><p>Xue Fangli opened his eyes again.</p><p>The dormitory was silent, the curtain hanging down, with the young boy sound asleep in his arms. His black hair spread over his shoulder, breathing slowly and deeply.</p><p>It had only been a dream.</p><p>His eyelids lowered, yet the sensation on his palm lingered, as if he could still hear that cat-like sobbing.</p><p>Jiang Juan had cried many times before, but never with such a sound—repeatedly savoring it, filled with passion and pleasure.</p><p>Before then, the aura around Jiang Juan always managed to soothe all his agitation and ferocity, but at this moment, no matter how delicate the fragrance, Xue Fangli could not find peace.</p><p>His hand loosely rested on the boy’s waist. Perhaps out of regret or a desire to know if that waist was truly so soft, he held it firmly.</p><p>Indeed, it was not even a span long.</p><p>And indeed...</p><p>soft enough to drive one mad with desire.</p><p>"…It hurts."</p><p>Jiang Juan slept deeply, but he did not hesitate to complain verbally, mumbling two words before turning his head and fluttering his curled eyelashes.</p><p>Clean, with no mist covering it.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time, and something gradually became clear in his heart and took root.</p><p>He wanted him to stay by his side.</p><p>But he also wanted—</p><p>The answer was right before him, but Xue Fangli suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>"Fangli."</p><p>A woman called out softly, followed by an intense headache. He had been in the monastery's dormitory, but he saw the woman sitting in front of the mirror again, combing her long hair gently.</p><p>"Do you know how to keep someone with you?"</p><p>In the copper-toned mirror, she lightly curved her red lips, and the golden step decorations swung continuously, "Forever, never forget your heart."</p><p>She said, "A bird must break its wings, a snake must pull out its venomous fangs, let it fear you, let it rely solely on you to live, become your liana."</p><p>"But if you forget your heart, you will be unwilling to part with them. You will hesitate and have pity, then you can only keep her for a moment. In the future, if you forget to close the cage—she—"</p><p>"will fly away."</p><p>The woman smiled and said, "My Fangli, do you remember?"</p><p>"A single thought of delusion, the heart is injured by all things, thus bearing all worldly suffering."</p><p>Whispering softly, her figure faded, Xue Fangli heard her crying in despair and cursing in anger.</p><p>"I hate you, I hate you so much. Why don't you just die?"</p><p>"You cannot keep me. This life, you cannot keep anyone, and no one wishes to stay for your sake."</p><p>"You are a monster, you are a monster, you deserve to die, you deserve to die—!"</p><p>The sharp cry almost pierced her eardrums. Sch Fangli's vision was filled with red.</p><p>He wanted to keep Jiang Juan.</p><p>Even if he was weak to the point of being unable to hold on for long.</p><p>Those surging, clear desires were ultimately restrained in his heart. Sch Fangli closed his eyes indifferently.</p><p>He remembered every word that woman had said.</p><p>When Jiang Juan woke up again, there was only him in the cell.</p><p>He sat for a while and prepared to get out of bed, but when he pressed his hand to the side, he felt something soft. Only then did he realize that several layers of silk brocade had been laid on the bed again.</p><p>Jiang Juan found it increasingly comfortable as she lay back, emitting heartfelt admiration once more.</p><p>—"The Prince is too kind."</p><p>High Official ❄️: "…"</p><p>Having heard such words so often, he was numb. He could now do nothing but remain expressionless.</p><p>High Official ❄️ knocked on the door and told Jiang Juan, "Princess Consort, the abbot came by earlier, but since you were sleeping, the Prince did not have you woken up. The abbot said to come back when you woke up. Should I call him now?"</p><p>Since Sch Fangli was not around, Jiang Juan naturally chose to avoid him. He shook his head, "I will leave."</p><p>Afterward, Jiang Juan asked, "Where is the Prince? Why isn't he here?"</p><p>The high-ranking official gāojiăng answered, "Prince Wang was invited by the Cavalry General."</p><p>Jiāng Juàn said, "Oh," recalling that the high-ranking official had mentioned earlier that people from the general's mansion were also at Wondrous Spirit Temple. He didn't pay much heed to it and, after getting himself ready, Jiāng Juàn said, "If Prince Wang asks, just say I went for a walk."</p><p>As he finished speaking, Jiāng Juàn walked out. Since he was going for a walk, the guards stationed outside followed him closely.</p><p>Wondrous Spirit Temple was much like an ordinary temple, and Jiāng Juàn soon lost interest in sightseeing. After some thought, he decided to go see the beauty's religious ceremony at Yúměiníng Hall.</p><p>However, he didn't know where it was located. Jiāng Juàn looked around, then approached a monk sweeping the grounds to ask for directions.</p><p>"Excuse me, do you happen to know where the beauty's religious ceremony is being held?"</p><p>"In Heavenly Treasure Hall."</p><p>The monk pointed in the direction and Jiāng Juàn thanked him before proceeding forward. Suddenly, he heard a voice from above: "Hey, what are you doing at the beauty's religious ceremony?"</p><p>Jiāng Juàn looked up curiously and saw a young man sitting on a tree branch, about his age, nibbling on a peach with evident enjoyment.</p><p>"I . . ."</p><p>Before Jiāng Juàn could reply, the young man in the tree recognized him, froze for a moment, then dropped the peach from his hand, which rolled down on the ground.</p><p>Jiāng Juàn asked again, "What's wrong?"</p><p>The young man shook his head dazedly. "N-nothing . . ."</p><p>After that, he glanced at Jiāng Juàn once more.</p><p>Jiāng Juàn looked up at him. The young man was not exceptionally handsome; between his eyebrows and eyes was a unique beauty, purer than moonlight and cleaner than snow, setting him apart from the ordinary.</p><p>This beauty, Jiāng Juàn had seen before.</p><p>It looked so familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen it.</p><p>The young man tried to calm his nerves and jumped down from the tree. He asked him again, "What are you doing at the Yumei's ceremony?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "Just watching."</p><p>The young man glanced at him, "Then why don't you watch other ceremonies?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "I don't want to."</p><p>But the young man said, "They are all ceremonies. Why do you watch Yumei's but not others?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him curiously, "Why should I watch other ceremonies?"</p><p>The young man pointed out sharply, "Isn't Yumei someone else? With so many others, why did you choose Yumei?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>They couldn't continue the conversation. It was all repetitive talk. Jiang Juan politely said goodbye, "I'll go now."</p><p>"Wait," the young man caught up to him in a few steps, "You're watching Yumei's ceremony, right? I'll follow you."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed "Ah," and asked him, "You're going too?"</p><p>The young man looked puzzled, "What do you mean by 'you're going too'? If you can go, why can't I?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He had to explain slowly, "I didn't mean that. I just asked out of curiosity. I didn't know you were also attending Yumei's ceremony."</p><p>The young man, after hearing this, posed another soul-searching question, "Just because you don't know if I want to go, does it mean I can't?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How despairing, is this person a professional debater?</p><p>"Hey, why aren't you speaking?"</p><p>Seemingly because he was silent for too long, the boy tried to start a conversation again, "You asked me just now, and now you're not speaking again. Are you being polite?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and really didn't want to engage with this debater, so he chose to use the vague method, "Yeah, you're right, I'm not being polite."</p><p>The boy looked at him and then slowly said, "So just because you say you're not polite, are you not polite? Can you represent everyone?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said calmly, "Ah, you're right."</p><p>"Did you grow a mouth to only say that you're right?"</p><p>"You're right."</p><p>"You—"</p><p>"You're right."</p><p>The boy stared at him. A good debater like this was actually rendered speechless and unable to argue anymore. The world finally became quiet.</p><p>Jiang Juan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>But he didn't expect that in the next second, the boy happily said, "Your temper seems pretty good. I have some brothers who can't help but want to punch me as soon as they start talking to me and even declare that no one doesn't want to hit me. I think you're still okay."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, afraid of being tricked so he didn't say anything. However, not long after, the boy introduced himself again, "What's your name?"</p><p>After asking, he also introduced himself, and both of them almost said their names at the same time.</p><p>"Jiang Qingliang."</p><p>"Jiang Juan."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and exclaimed in shock, "Ah? It's you?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang wasn't doing much better either, he said incredulously, "You're the one who pushed Nian into the lake?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>This couldn't be happening.</p><p>Miaolin Temple is so large; there was no way he would run into the main characters here.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>No wonder he felt like he had seen this beauty before, he really had.</p><p>Only—</p><p>How much has Jiang Juan changed!?</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>He is now the Consort Wang.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Qingliang suddenly raised his head, looking utterly astonished.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't notice and merely recalled the plot.</p><p>In the original series, Jiang Qingliang came from a martial general's family but was forced to abandon martial arts and study literature. He was thrown into the national prison by the general, and he was unhappy about it. His studies were in shambles, but he excelled at leading group disturbances.</p><p>This man had practiced martial arts since childhood and was a naughty person. Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment and decided to go back for acupuncture instead. He said, "…Forget it, I can’t do it anymore, I’m done."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang, however, said, "Wait a minute."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang’s mood was rather complicated. "Regarding Brother Nian’s feelings, we’ll discuss that later. You came here——for the Lady Yu Mei’s ceremony, who sent you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan answered honestly, "I did it myself."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang sized him up and asked again, "What about His Excellency?"</p><p>"His Excellency… he…" The King didn’t want to come, but Jiang Juan still processed his words a bit. "He’s busy."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang sneered, "Busy? I think he’s too afraid to come."</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned; he disliked Jiang Qingliang’s tone and would usually start dodging when he didn’t want to engage. </p><p>But this time, the words "You’re right" were on his lips, but Jiang Juan still couldn’t hold it in. He said seriously, "His Excellency not coming has its reasons, but it definitely isn’t because of fear."</p><p>"Do you know?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang sneered once more, "Tell me, what kind of person is he? Not only did he personally murder his concubine, but he also set fire to her corpse. How could he dare come?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p>
