						<p>The little wench Zhengjun was getting dressed up, and you could use your strong purchasing power to bring her out. Jiang Juan, oblivious, leaned against Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>The shards of glass were removed, and Doctor Sun dressed Jiang Juan up again before instructing him, "Don't get off the bed or touch water for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded weakly.</p><p>He nestled in Xue Fangli's embrace; he had only gotten his hair wet during the herbal bath session, but now sweat was breaking out on his forehead. The young man exuded a sweet scent of medicinal herbs all over.</p><p>Xue Fangli sniffed Jiang Juan's breath and occasionally rubbed Jiang Juan's nape with his hand, looking rather relaxed and at ease for the first time in a long while.</p><p>Doctor Sun had never seen anyone more afraid of pain than Jiang Juan. He couldn't help but chuckle and said, "Rest well."</p><p>Jiang Juan was also exhausted; he lifted his head and asked Xue Fangli listlessly, "Prince, how do I get back?"</p><p>Unable to walk, he couldn't go back on his own. And it wouldn't be proper for a girl like Lan Ting to carry him.</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "No need, you can rest here."</p><p>He made sure not to take up Xue Fangli's spot. Jiang Juan leaned against the sleeping mat, separating himself from Xue Fangli's arms. The scent around his nose began to dissipate, and Xue Fangli frowned slightly but nodded calmly.</p><p>He stood up; now the entire bed belonged to Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan fell asleep almost immediately, but in his drowsy state, he suddenly recalled a passage from a book.</p><p>—"That night, Prince Li went to another villa. In the middle of the night, he was struck by a sudden illness and could not stop coughing up blood. The imperial physician who accompanied him rushed over but was helpless. Before dawn, news of Prince Li's death had already reached the capital. The emperor, upon hearing this, flew into a rage and adjourned court for three days, executing more than a hundred people."</p><p>In the middle of the night, he was struck by a sudden illness.</p><p>Before dawn, news of his death had already reached the capital.</p><p>When Doctor Sun finished treating Jiang Juan's foot injury, it seemed like dawn was already approaching?</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>Lan Ting had just been brought in to wipe Jiang Juan's face. Seeing this, she quietly asked, "Did I wake you, my lord?"</p><p>Jiang Juan absentmindedly shook his head and turned to look outside, only to see the faint light of dawn.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>What was going on with this story? Not only was the prince's character a far cry from what he expected, but the plot didn't match up either.</p><p>Midnight had passed, and the prince hadn't suffered from any acute illness; instead, a pack of wolves had appeared.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>With so many wolves around, if he had arrived later or not at all, and had ignored the unusual behavior of the young wolf, would something have happened to the prince?</p><p>Perhaps, the prince's death was an accident all along, not an acute illness?</p><p>He had spent almost half the night with the prince, who indeed hadn't suffered from any acute illness.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>That made some sense.</p><p>In other words, he had inadvertently saved the prince and altered the course of events.</p><p>Realizing this, Jiang Juan's mood became somewhat complicated.</p><p>The Prince was a great good man. Every time Jiang Juan thought about his fate, she felt regret. Now that the Prince was safe and sound, it could not have been better.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan herself was not doing well. She had come to play dead and had even planned how to be happy after the Prince's death.</p><p>But now...</p><p>Her life as a dead fish had flown away, and her happiness was gone too.</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to cry but couldn't. She lowered her head and hopelessly slammed it against the handrail.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli spoke indifferently. Jiang Juan shook her head dejectedly, "Nothing much."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at her. The young man had pale skin; even a light collision made his forehead turn red. He asked, "What are you unhappy about?"</p><p>Of course, it was the loss of her imagined happy life—guarding the longest widowhood, being the saltiest fish, and spending a lifetime lounging in the prince's mansion.</p><p>But Jiang Juan couldn't tell the truth. She lazily replied, "...My feet really hurt."</p><p>Not mentioning it was fine, but once she said it out loud, Jiang Juan realized another problem.</p><p>The plot had changed; there were no casualties in the prince's mansion except for her own feet.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be.</p><p>Why did the dead fish get injured?</p><p>Was this the consequence of not trying hard?</p><p>He couldn't help but think of various things.</p><p>No way.</p><p>He only wanted to be a salted fish, not a princess.</p><p>Maybe he should run away?</p><p>According to the plot, he still had a grandfather. Going back to the countryside to seek refuge with his grandfather wasn't a bad idea. Jiang Juan thought about it more and more, finding it increasingly feasible. He regained some energy and said, "Prince..."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied nonchalantly, his gaze lingering on Jiang Juan for a long time, his expression difficult to read.</p><p>He was lying.</p><p>The reason the teenager was unhappy wasn't due to his foot injury.</p><p>Jiang Juan said guiltily, "On our wedding day, you said you would see me off and asked if I could reconsider in a few days. Now you can ask again."</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched, "What's up?"</p><p>"I've changed my mind," Jiang Juan said slowly, "I thought about it, and it seems like I've been causing you trouble all along. So... maybe you should send me away."</p><p>After hearing this, Xue Fangli didn't immediately respond. His expression remained unchanged as he lifted his crimson lips to smile nonchalantly, then said regretfully, "No can do."</p><p>When the teenager was sobbing in his arms, if Jiang Juan had said he wanted to leave any earlier, he would have sent him away. But now that he was saying it, it was too late; he himself had changed his mind.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, smiling gently. "You saved my life; I'm too grateful to repay you, let alone find it troublesome?"</p><p>"How can it be considered troublesome?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...It is."</p><p>He hadn't given up hope yet and wanted to struggle once more. Jiang Juan quickly thought of something else to say, "Your Majesty, I have always suffered from a difficult-to-cure illness. The master said that this year would bring a calamity, and there's a chance I might not survive it. I'm afraid I might transmit my sickness to you."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, "It won't do any harm; I already have an incurable condition, which is unrelated to you."</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli thoughtfully asked, "This is the reason for your unhappiness?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and couldn't explain further, so he nodded, "Yes, I'm afraid of burdening Your Majesty."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time. Then he walked over, extending his hand towards Jiang Juan. His pale fingertips brushed against the spot where the young man's forehead had been hit red. He smiled lightly, "You have injuries on your feet and shouldn't travel around; rest and recover in peace, don't overthink it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Alright."</p><p>He had forgotten about this matter. So Jiang Juan was truly unable to leave for now.</p><p>However—</p><p>Is Your Majesty's incurable condition hemoptysis?</p><p>Jiang Juan recalled what he said on their wedding day.</p><p>"—I have little time left, would you like me to send you off?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pondered for a few seconds.</p><p>Perhaps—I think—he might still become the saltiest fish.</p><p>No, how can you think like that?</p><p>Jiang Juan silently reprimanded herself in her heart, then honestly lay back down.</p><p>——Chapter Three has already arrived. Perhaps there won't be much of a problem if I endure for a bit longer?</p><p>Shangshufu.</p><p>Jiang Nian picked up a cup of hot tea, lowered his head to blow lightly on it, watching the leaves swirl in the cup as steam rose to meet his face. However, his thoughts drifted away involuntarily.</p><p>In his previous life, he was already heading to Beizhuang.</p><p>——Dawang has passed away.</p><p>He feared this man so much that even hearing of his death, he did not want to pay his last respects or see him one last time. But as Dawang's concubine, Jiang Nian had no choice but to go; thus, he boarded the carriage.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Nian did not manage to catch up.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, the Emperor personally rushed to Beizhuang. Upon seeing the body, he was grief-stricken and unable to bear it, so he ordered the coffin to be sealed and directly transported to the mausoleum.</p><p>Letting out a sigh of relief, Jiang Nian came back to his senses but could not help frowning again.</p><p>Why hasn't Father returned yet?</p><p>He should not have been at court today.</p><p>In Jiang Nian's memory, Dawang died late at night. On that day, the Emperor did not attend the morning court session, so Father should have already returned home.</p><p>Suddenly, a sense of unease welled up in his heart.</p><p>Another two incense sticks' time passed, and sounds were finally heard outside the door.</p><p>"Xiao Nian, what's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu strode over. He had heard from his servants that Jiang Nian was waiting for him in the study and hurriedly came over, "Is something the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook her head and asked, "Father, where did you go? Why are you back now?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu chuckled and said, "Today is not a rest day, I went to court."</p><p>To court?</p><p>Jiang Nian was startled and hesitated before asking, "Father, did anything happen last night?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu never concealed court affairs from him and had also intended to prepare Jiang Nian in advance. However, there really wasn't much to report today, so he replied, "Nothing happened, what's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Nian pressed, "What happened?"</p><p>Jiang Nian blurted out, "Then what about the Prince of Li?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu was baffled, "What about him?"</p><p>"Nothing happened to him?"</p><p>"What could happen to him?"</p><p>Jiang Nian sized up Jiang Shushu a few times and saw his genuinely puzzled expression, indicating that he had no idea. She couldn't help but tightly pinch her palm.</p><p>How could this happen?</p><p>It seems that Wang is safe, and the Emperor did not dismiss the court today.</p><p>Since his reincarnation, Jiang Nian has experienced events identical to those of his previous life; nothing unexpected has ever happened.</p><p>"This shouldn't be..."</p><p>Seeing Jiang's pale face, Secretary Shangwen asked with concern, "Xiao Nian, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p>
