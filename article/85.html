						<p>"Mr. Wang, what happened that Prince is not here?"</p><p>In the study room, Gu Yunzhi asked in a soft voice.</p><p>Mr. Wang smiled, "Prime Minister Gu, perhaps His Highness was delayed by something."</p><p>It was as if he had said nothing, so Gu Yunzhi shook his head and could only pick up the teacup to drink. Su Feiyue, who sat beside him, said leisurely, "Perhaps it is Princess Consort's issue."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi turned his head, ready to say something when the door creaked open.</p><p>Xue Fangli walked in wearing a completely black robe adorned with golden feathers, intricate and flamboyant. His sleeves swept past as Su Feiyue and company greeted him with smiles, "We have met Crown Prince."</p><p>But only one person came forth, carrying someone around 18 years old in his arms. Gu Yunzhi was taken aback and silently gave Su Feiyue a thumbs-up before bowing and saying, "This humble servant has met Princess Consort."</p><p>Jiang Juan saw him and vaguely felt that he seemed familiar with the person and the voice sounded familiar as well—like Xiamǎ or Jiang Jiangjuan who had mentioned Prime Minister Gu. A strange feeling rose in Jiang Juan's heart.</p><p>He hesitated to speak but was cut off by Mr. Wang, who said in surprise, "Prince, is Princess Consort's eye injured? Why doesn't he let her rest?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with a flat tone, "He insisted on following."</p><p>Mr. Wang nodded with a smile and didn't say anything further, only stating, "Prince, the memorial has been brought over, and several officials have arrived. You settle Princess Consort… shall we begin?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>What memorial?</p><p>Is His Highness really dealing with official matters?</p><p>Jiang Juan stiffened as Xue Fangli laid him on a soft bed and instructed someone to move a screen. He then said without any apology, "Everyone has been waiting long enough. His eyesight is impaired, and he is also separated from others, so he must stay by Prince Wang's side, which delayed us a bit."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>What did it mean that he was separated from others? Did the Prince need to be with him at all times?</p><p>Why would the Prince talk like this?</p><p>Was this some kind of death scene?</p><p>Xue Fangli did not specify, but everyone in the room understood that the "he" referred to Jiang Juan. They naturally conformed and said, "It's fine, it's fine."</p><p>No matter how they assured him, Jiang Juan was deeply despairing.</p><p>Why would things be like this.</p><p>Was the Prince interrogating Minister Li?</p><p>He felt so embarrassed; it was too embarrassing for words.</p><p>Jiang Juan was confused and bewildered. Due to his extreme hopelessness, he almost let Xue Fangli do as he pleased. In the end, he was placed on his lap and held in his arms. Xue Fangli said casually, "Let's start."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi: "The governor of Jingzhou submitted a report recently stating that Jingzhou has been affected by locusts…"</p><p>These were all urgent memorials that Jiang Juan listened to for a while before finding them rather boring. He tried to run away but ended up just listening to whatever nonsense was being said, eventually falling asleep.</p><p>However, he didn't understand why today things were different. First, Lanting made him sleep, and now in the Prince's arms, he was about to fall asleep when his head tilted, and he was woken up again.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pressed down on the hand shaking him. Xue Fangli looked at him and said, "Stay with Wang to listen."</p><p>Jiang Juan just wanted to sleep, "This is your business, you listen yourself."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him in a half-smile, half-laugh, "Who is Wang for?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and said firmly, "For the cat."</p><p>"And... only one person needs to make an effort at home. Your Highness, you can do it."</p><p>He first referred to the cat as a dog, and now he referred to a person as a cat, speaking with such confidence. Xue Fangli pinched Jiang Juan's face, "You think Wang can do it."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "As long as you disturb my sleep, Your Highness, you'll be number one."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan grabbed his hand and earnestly said, "Your Highness, since you're capable, let me go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan was really preparing to go back to sleep. He rubbed against Xue Fangli's embrace, found a new position for himself, and adjusted his posture. Everything was ready; he just needed to fall asleep.</p><p>But a pale hand reached out and pinched Jiang Juan's chin. Xue Fangli slowly said, "Wang can do it. Get up and stay with Wang to listen."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>He dramatically pretended to be dead. This hand then gently stroked upwards, pressing on Jiang Juan's lips. Xue Fangli lowered his voice and said, "If you pretend to sleep again, Wang will kiss you."</p><p>At that moment, Gu Yunzhi and Su Feiyue exchanged views regarding the memorial against the locust disaster in Jingzhou. Gu Yunzhi asked, "Your Highness, what do you think about the locust disaster in Jingzhou?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond but only asked Jiang Juan, "Get up?"</p><p>He lowered his head, fingers gently rubbing his lips. Jiang Juan endured it. Gu Yunzhi waited for a moment and then called out several times, "Your Highness?"</p><p>Governor Wang also found it strange and walked over. His footsteps were heavy, but there was a sound, one step after another, gradually getting closer.</p><p>No matter what, Jiang Juan still had pride. Since the Prince's first business transaction, it was all because of his tardiness that he was seen being humiliated again. Jiang Juan truly understood; he couldn't do anything and could only submit. Jiang Juan gloomily bit his finger.</p><p>A slight pain caused Xue Fangli to open his eyelids and said, "Jiang Juan is sleeping, thank goodness." He responded with a "Mm."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi then repeated, "What do you think about this locust disaster?"</p><p>"Burning them with bonfires can naturally work. But it requires a considerable amount of manpower and resources, which the local officials cannot afford to cover every area. If another reward is issued, regardless of who, whether burning or beating..."</p><p>He spoke leisurely, and Governor Wang stopped his footsteps, ultimately not entering behind the screen. Jiang Juan heaved a sigh of relief, but he had allowed him to sleep peacefully, so Jiang Juan was indeed very happy, increasing the strength with which he bit his finger.</p><p>At that moment, Xue Fangli paused in his words, his pale lips tinged with a light red. He slightly opened his mouth, biting a piece of his finger, his tongue accidentally brushing over it, leaving a damp trace.</p><p>He sucked on his finger, almost stirring it inside Jiang Juan's mouth. The biter was Jiang Juan, and the one regretting it was also Jiang Juan. He felt comfortable but didn't dare make any sound, so he reached out to push Xue Fangli away.</p><p>Behind the screen, Gu Yunzhi asked what they were doing, but Xue Fangli stopped speaking halfway. Gu Yunzhi inquired further, "What?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was quite calm as he teased Jiang Juan with his fingers, saying, "Exchange locusts for rice and grain."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi thought for a moment and slowly nodded, "Right, indeed right."</p><p>"No wonder the Prince spoke so, it turns out there was another ingenious plan."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>The Prince's words were just to torment him.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt very annoyed. If he had chased after, now the one being toyed with would be that little cat. Jiang Juan should have been happily petting cats instead of being played by the Prince.</p><p>It seemed that he had seen Jiang Juan's eyes mist over with tears, and Xue Fangli only let go of Jiang Juan then. Jiang Juan slumped weakly onto the bed, and when the Prince ordered him to sleep, he could only force himself to stay awake and listen slightly.</p><p>What was this about private salt, official silver for personal use, frequent rainfall in the south?</p><p>It was so boring, he wanted to sleep.</p><p>Wait a moment.</p><p>Frequent rainfall in the south?</p><p>Jiang Juan sat up abruptly.</p><p>It was mid-May, summer had arrived, and it was the rainy season.</p><p>He almost forgot about this.</p><p>Gu Yunzhi said, "…Recently, there has been frequent rain in Jiangnan, causing rivers to overflow. The Yangzhou Prefecture is requesting some silver from the court for flood prevention."</p><p>"For how many years have they come up with this reason to ask for silver?"</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled and shook her head as if it didn't matter at all. Gu Yunzhi also sighed, "Yes, every year there's flooding, every year they want silver."</p><p>Su Feiyue said, "Let's put it off for now."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi agreed with this idea and waited for Xue Fangli to speak.</p><p>"Prince…"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated before forcing himself to speak.</p><p>In the original text, when Emperor Xing was ill, he was treated by Crown Prince Xue Chaohua. At that time, something like this had happened.</p><p>At that time, Xue Chaohua also did not give it much thought and simply set aside the memorial. However, precisely in this year, a real downpour did occur.</p><p>This torrential rain inundated many places, turning countless people into refugees, affecting numerous others, and even triggering a series of chain reactions. By the time Xue Chaohua regretted it, it was too late; he could only hastily send the Marquis of Anping southward. But by then, any remedy would be like adding cupfuls of water to a burning cartload of wood—ineffectual.</p><p>Previously, Jiang Juan thought that this incident was about the main character and the Marquis of Anping; all he and the Prince needed to do was escape in time. However, now—</p><p>The Prince had already become the Crown Prince, and it would be up to him to handle the situation.</p><p>The previous eldest prince, who did not handle matters properly, met a rather miserable end.</p><p>Alright.</p><p>"Can we suppress it? What if there really is a flood?"</p><p>Xue Falü: "What are you worrying about these things for?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Is this what you made me listen to?"</p><p>Xue Falü gave him a glance and explained in a calm tone, "The southern summer rains receive annual allocations from the court."</p><p>Huang Zongguan, hearing this, smiled and said, "Your Highness has a valid point. The climate in the south is special, and His Majesty is also very concerned. However, no matter how much silver is given, it is still considered insufficient by the local officials. Every time summer comes, when memorials are presented, His Majesty always gets furious."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi interjected, "Moreover, while Yangzhou receives funds, Jinling, Kaifeng, Suzhou, and Hangzhou must also receive them simultaneously. It's not feasible to favor one over another; meanwhile, provisions and troops in the border regions are urgently needed, so it’s better to give priority."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Alright."</p><p>He did not understand these matters well enough. What Jiang Juan understood from Gu Yunzhi's words was not that they wanted to give but that they were giving. Jiang Juan slowly raised his eyebrows, feeling that changing one's fate was very difficult.</p><p>Seeing his furrowed brow, Xue Falü stared at Jiang Juan for a few moments and asked in a dismissive tone, "Are you suffering from Buddha’s illness again?"</p><p>What Buddha’s illness? Jiang Juan said leisurely, "You are the one with Buddha’s illness. I merely..."</p><p>Save your life.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't explain the plot to him, so she lied, "Last time, I had a nightmare. I dreamed of a flood where many people drowned and others became refugees."</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered, "Nightmare? Wang sees you sleeping till midday every day, never once woken up by a nightmare."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could they continue this conversation? It was impossible.</p><p>He leaned over and happily bumped into Xue Fangli's chest, angrily justifying himself, "Who says having a nightmare means you'll wake up scared?"</p><p>"I sleep well. I've never been awakened by nightmares."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't comment on this but said to Gu Yunzhi, "Counselor Gu, continue."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi responded and picked up another memorial.</p><p>The flooding in the south was like a heavy rock pressing on his heart. Jiang Juan wanted to put it aside, but when someone brought it up, he couldn't help feeling anxious. His brows remained knitted together as he thought about it more and more, causing him great distress.</p><p>He was already irritated. Before, he just wanted to sleep, but the Young Master made him stay awake. Now, Jiang Juan truly had no mood for sleep.</p><p>The Young Master ignored this. Once summer arrived and the heavy rains came, they would all be doomed.</p><p>Jiang Juan started to feel restless. He wriggled in Xue Fangli's arms, becoming more and more afraid with each passing thought, his furrowed brow never relaxing.</p><p>After a while, a hand brushed against him, and Xue Fangli irritably asked, "Why are you starting this again."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked bewildered and asked, "What? What is starting again?"</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned. "This time, what are you afraid of?"</p><p>How to say it. The torrential rain is something in the future, even if Jiang Juan were to tell the truth, no one would believe him. Moreover, both the Prince and Minister Gu as well as Eunuch Wang had explained to him that there was no allocation from the court.</p><p>Struggling with his thoughts for a long time, Jiang Juan could not think of what to say, so he sighed.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his expression unchanged. He enjoyed Jiang Juan being like this very much, although Xue Fangli did have some idea about the reason behind Jiang Juan's emotional state.</p><p>——The memorial from Yangzhou.</p><p>Staring at Jiang Juan for a long time, Xue Fangli finally spoke up—more so to Gu Yunzhi than to Jiang Juan. "Minister Gu, keep the memorial from Yangzhou."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi was taken aback. "Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan was also surprised and then raised his head. "Prince…"</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was cold. "You want to be a Bodhisattva, what can I do about it?"</p><p>Although he was once again ridiculed by the Prince, there was some relief that Jiang Juan was quite delighted with this turn of events. He relaxed his furrowed brow and slowly curved his eyes into a smile, a happy expression. "Prince, you are really good."</p><p>Seeing him smiling with his eyebrows arched, Xue Fangli's heart softened slightly as he asked, "Why do you like being a Bodhisattva so much?"</p><p>Jiang Juan clarified, "It's not about being a Bodhisattva; I just…"</p><p>"Prince, doing good deeds will bring blessings."</p><p>Xue Fangli snorted. "The Prince believes in ghosts and deities, more so in the law of cause and effect, why does he need blessings?"</p><p>Just believe it if you want to, Jiang Juan changed his approach. "Then consider it for me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. "Consider it for you? The reason the Prince kept the memorial is clear to you?"</p><p>"Shāng Wáng was just for you."</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a kind tone, "You start bothering me the moment you fall asleep. You really are troublesome."</p>
