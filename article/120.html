						<p>What if we recognize each other? The paper still needs to be written, and I have to finish reading the list of books given by Professor Xue Fali. Xue Fali can't issue an edict prohibiting college students from writing papers; otherwise, he'll arrest everyone.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed deeply.</p><p>Xue Fali asked him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said with a gloomy expression, "I'm overwhelmed by the paper."</p><p>He lowered his head. He hadn't read more than two lines of the book when he remembered what his roommate had just said—during military training, Xue Fali almost got into a fight. Jiang Juan thought about it carefully and stood up, walking to the bookshelf.</p><p>"Here you are."</p><p>When he returned, Jiang Juan handed Xue Fali a book. Xue Fali glanced at it, and there were several words written on the cover.</p><p>—Citizen's Guide to Common Laws</p><p>Jiang Juan said seriously, "Times have changed; you should read this."</p><p>Xue Fali: "..."</p><p>His eyes swept over him with an expression that was almost amused. Jiang Juan wasn't intimidated at all; instead, he said solemnly, "If you accidentally get in trouble, I'll even marry you by stealing your household registration book, and my parents will force me to divorce you."</p><p>Xue Fali snorted, "I got it."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt that Xue Fali didn't believe him and was going to keep nagging. His phone lit up, indicating a message from his roommate.</p><p>His roommate seemed to be confused too; he had been dazed for a while and then refused to sit there, insisting on finding his own seat.</p><p>Jiang Juan opened the message.</p><p>[Juan-er, what's going on between you and Xue Fali?]</p><p>Jiang Juan replied truthfully. He selected two characters before sending them, and he heard someone sigh in clear dissatisfaction. Immediately afterward, his hand that was holding the phone was grabbed by another hand, and Xue Fangli also typed a few messages.</p><p>On the other side of the library, Jiang Juan's roommate was drinking water when his phone vibrated. He looked down and nearly choked on it.</p><p>[Acquainted.]</p><p>[Married.]</p><p>Roommate: ???</p><p>Married?</p><p>Married??</p><p>The roommate was stunned.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly took back his phone, furrowing his brow to explain to the roommate.</p><p>[The previous message wasn't from me; don't believe his lies.]</p><p>Roommate: "..."</p><p>If it wasn't Jiang Juan who sent it, then who did?</p><p>Xue Fangli?</p><p>With a click, the phone fell onto the table. The roommate looked terrified and only after a long while slowly picked up the phone, adding the other dorm mates to a new group.</p><p>[Brothers, wake up!]</p><p>[Our Jue'er is going to be ruined!!!]</p><p>[Xie something is after him!]</p><p>After sending the message, my roommate also named the new group.</p><p>—Protect our Jue'er!!!</p><p>Struggling to calm down, when it got dark, Jiang Juan couldn't bear to read anymore. He flopped down listlessly, flipping through pages, and after a while, he stood up.</p><p>Xie Fangli opened his eyelids. Jiang Juan whispered, "I'm going to find another book."</p><p>If he didn't want to read this one, he could look for other books on the reading list at least. It was better than doing nothing.</p><p>Xie Fangli nodded and elegantly turned the pages. Jiang Juan curiously leaned in; it seemed like an economics book, which made him dizzy after just a glance. He asked, "Isn't this boring?"</p><p>Xie Fangli replied, "Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Then why are you reading it?"</p><p>Xie Fangli glanced at him and said, "If I don't read, how will I take care of you in the future?"</p><p>What did it have to do with him? Jiang Juan said blankly, "I'm easy to take care of."</p><p>Xie Fangli didn't comment on that. He lowered his eyes again to continue reading. Jiang Juan, feeling indignant, hugged his arm and insisted he listen to him: "Taking care of me? It's clearly because you have so many companies to inherit and are relying on me."</p><p>But Jiang Juan also didn't want to argue further; if not for him, Xie Fangli wouldn't need to do all these things.</p><p>After all, they were in the library. Even if their voices were low, it wasn't good to talk for too long. After complaining, Jiang Juan went to the bookshelf and started looking for the books on the reading list that he needed.</p><p>[Brothers, wake up!]</p><p>[Our Jue'er is going to be ruined!!!]</p><p>[Xie Something has set his sights on him!]</p><p>After sending the message, my roommate named the new group.</p><p>—Protect our Jue'er!!!</p><p>Struggling to calm down, as it grew dark, Jiang Juan couldn't continue reading. He slumped down listlessly, flipping through pages, and after a while, he stood up.</p><p>Xie Fangli opened his eyes. Jiang Juan whispered, "I'm going to find another book."</p><p>If he didn't want to read this one, he could at least look for other books on the reading list.

He asked, "Isn't this boring?"</p><p>Xie Fangli replied, "Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Then why are you reading it?"</p><p>Xie Fangli glanced at him and said, "If I don't read now, how will I take care of you later?"</p><p>What did that have to do with him? Jiang Juan said blankly, "I'm easy to take care of."</p><p>Xie Fangli didn't comment. He lowered his eyes again to continue reading. Jiang Juan, feeling indignant, hugged Xie Fangli's arm and insisted he listen: "Taking care of me? It's clearly because you have so many companies to inherit and are relying on me."</p><p>But Jiang Juan also didn't want to argue further; if not for him, Xie Fangli wouldn't need to do all these things.</p><p>Since they were in the library, even if their voices were low, it wasn't good to talk for too long. After complaining, Jiang Juan went to the bookshelf and started looking for the books on the reading list that he needed.</p><p>[Brothers, wake up!]</p><p>[Our Jue'er is in danger!!!]</p><p>[Xie Something has his eye on him!]</p><p>After sending the message, my roommate gave the new group a name:</p><p>—Protect our Jue'er!!!</p><p>Struggling to calm down, as night fell, Jiang Juan couldn't bear to read anymore. He slumped down listlessly, flipping through pages, and after a while, he stood up.</p><p>Xie Fangli stirred slightly. Jiang Juan whispered, "I'm going to find another book."</p><p>If he didn't want to read this one, he could at least look for other books on the reading list. It was better than doing nothing.</p><p>Xie Fangli nodded and turned the pages elegantly. Jiang Juan leaned in curiously; it seemed like an economics book that made him dizzy after just a glance.

After complaining, Jiang Juan went to the bookshelf and started looking for the books on the reading list that he needed.</p><p>He went through one book at a time, walking past shelf after shelf. Before long, his left hand was holding several books, while his right hand picked up another new book from the shelves.</p><p>This posture made it really inconvenient to take books, and the shelves were too crowded. Jiang Juan tried several times but failed to retrieve the book she wanted. Xue Fangli noticed this and walked over to her.</p><p>He stood behind Jiang Juan, took the books in her hands, then raised his hand to reach for a book on the shelf.</p><p>His fingers accidentally touched Jiang Juan's.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled and turned around instinctively.</p><p>"This one?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan in a calm voice.</p><p>He was taller than Jiang Juan, so he had to slightly bend his head when speaking, causing his breath to fall directly on her ear and neck, which felt damp and itchy.</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately covered her ears and replied without looking: "Yeah, that one."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at her but did not take the book down immediately. Instead, he grabbed Jiang Juan's wrist.</p><p>This wrist was fair-skinned yet very thin, seeming as if it could break with a single bend.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You're missing a red thread."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked over too. She used to wear a relic on this hand, and she replied with a "hum," "It's empty now."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, the corner of his lips lifting slightly, "I have something to tell you."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "What?"</p><p>"That red thread was dyed with my heart's blood."</p><p>He leafed through one book after another, walking past row upon row of shelves. In no time, he had several books in his left hand and reached for another from the shelf with his right.</p><p>This posture made it terribly difficult to reach the books, and the shelves were overcrowded. Jiang Juan tried several times but couldn't find the book she wanted. Xue Fangli noticed her struggle and approached.</p><p>He stood behind Jiang Juan, took the books from her hands, then raised his own to grab a book from the shelf.</p><p>His fingers brushed against hers inadvertently.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled and turned around automatically.</p><p>"This one?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked calmly.</p><p>Being taller, he had to lower his head slightly when speaking, directing his breath onto her ear and neck, feeling damp and itchy.</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly covered her ears and answered without looking: "Yeah, that's the one."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at her but didn't take the book right away. Instead, he grabbed her wrist.</p><p>The wrist was fair-skinned but delicate, appearing almost fragile.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You're missing a red cord."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked over as well. She usually wore an amulet on this hand and responded with a nod: "It's empty now."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, lips curling slightly, "I have something to tell you."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "What?"</p><p>"That red cord was dyed with my heart's blood."</p><p>He perused one book at a time, moving past each shelf methodically. Soon enough, his left hand held several books, while his right reached for another from the crowded shelves.</p><p>This awkward posture made it incredibly difficult to retrieve books. Jiang Juan tried multiple times but couldn't find the one she wanted. Xue Fangli noticed her predicament and walked over.</p><p>He stood behind Jiang Juan, took the books from her hands, and raised his own to reach for a book on the shelf.</p><p>His fingers accidentally brushed against hers.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled and turned around instinctively.</p><p>"This one?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked calmly.</p><p>Being taller, he had to lower his head slightly when speaking, directing his breath onto her ear and neck, making it feel damp and ticklish.</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly covered her ears and replied without looking: "Yes, that's the one."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at her but didn't take the book immediately. Instead, he grabbed her wrist.</p><p>The wrist was fair-skinned but delicate, almost fragile-looking.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You're missing a red thread."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked over as well. She usually wore an amulet on this hand and replied with a nod: "It's empty now."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, lips curling slightly, "I have something to tell you."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "What?"</p><p>"That red thread was dyed with my heart's blood."</p><p>Heart's blood.</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly opened her eyes wide.</p><p>"It's not Soul Binding, but Soul Locking," Xue Fangli said softly, "I lock you up because I'm afraid you'll leave."</p><p>Jiang Juan opened her mouth but didn't say a word for a long time.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked her, "Are you angry?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head. She stared at Xue Fangli blankly. Although she hadn't cried when they met again after so long, tears kept rolling down her face at this moment.</p><p>"Does it hurt? A lot?"</p><p>She didn't care about anything else but whether Xue Fangli was in pain.</p><p>"You don't hurt when I'm here."</p><p>"I'll always be here. I won't leave either. You really shouldn't be afraid anymore."</p><p>Jiang Juan softly promised her and sincerely comforted Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at her for a long time before finally nodding, "Mm."</p><p>Xue Fangli took the book Jiang Juan had mentioned earlier. This time, Jiang Juan actually glanced at it and shook her head, "It's not this one."</p><p>Jiang Juan wiped away her tears. After taking a book from the shelf, she found the others much easier to reach. She took the book she wanted and told Xue Fangli, "This is it."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded. Just as he was about to put the book back, a bookmark fell out of it. Xue Fangli picked it up, casually inserted it back between the pages, but then saw a poem.</p><p>"What can I use to keep you?</p><p>I give you the desolate street,</p><p>The despairing sunset, the moon in the wilderness.</p><p>I give you the sorrow of a person gazing at the lonely moon for a long time.</p><p>...</p><p>I give you my loneliness, my darkness, the thirst of my heart;</p><p>I try to move you with confusion, danger, and failure."</p><p>After reading this poem, Xue Fangli chuckled slightly.</p><p>Jiang Juan was walking ahead when she turned back and asked curiously, "What's wrong with this book?"</p><p>Xue Fangli put the book back and glanced at the spine again.</p><p>—Borges' Poems</p><p>A moment later, Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan, whose eyelashes were still glistening with moisture, and lazily spoke, "Nothing much, just some small tricks."</p><p>He walked towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>Suddenly, all the lights went out, plunging the library into darkness.</p><p>The sound of chairs moving and voices rose immediately. Unconsciously, Jiang Juan looked out the window; the distant teaching building was still brightly lit, making the situation crystal clear.</p><p>There was a power outage.</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Xue..."</p><p>His hand was suddenly grabbed, and the next moment, Jiang Juan was pulled against a bookshelf. The place was noisy with the buzzing of summer cicadas, footsteps moving about, and his own heartbeat. Yet, it was also eerily quiet. Distant lights bloomed in the night, and they hid in the library where one could not see their hand in front of them, concealed behind the most hidden bookshelf. Jiang Juan lifted his head; in the darkness, he could only see a silhouette. Instinctively, he embraced him, "Do you want to kiss me?" Xue Fangli did not respond; he raised his hand and caressed Jiang Juan's soft lips with his fingertips. After waiting for a moment, Jiang Juan almost confessed, "I want you to kiss me." Xue Fangli lowered his head so that their foreheads touched. With a "bang," the emergency exit was opened, and the librarian said, "There’s a power outage; everyone should return to your dormitories." The crowd moved past one by one, laughter and complaints rising and falling, but no one knew that just behind a wall, someone was making love. Jiang Juan whispered to Xue Fangli, "Shall we leave?" Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said, "Not yet." Jiang Juan nodded and smiled, "Neither do I want to leave. I just want to hide here and wait for you to kiss me." The world was bustling, but it had nothing to do with them. No matter how bright the world was, it did not concern them. Xue Fangli chuckled and leaned in to kiss Jiang Juan.</p><p>On this power-outage night, they once again embraced each other.</p>
