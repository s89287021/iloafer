						<p>Salty fish see salty fish, they are especially close.</p><p>Jiang Juan often felt out of place because he was too much like a lazy fish. He had just taken a nap, and when he woke up, there was a wild salted fish around him. He couldn’t help but exclaim, "What a coincidence."</p><p>Gu Puwang: "Indeed, it is coincidental."</p><p>Today, Gu Puwang should have been practicing archery with his fellow classmates at the National College of Confucianism, but since Guangye Hall was full of unruly troublemakers, the Master of Ceremony feared they might cause trouble and expelled them all to find a new place for practice.</p><p>Gu Puwang was too lazy to move, so he made an excuse about fishing and borrowed a fishing rod from nearby villagers. He spent the entire morning napping there.</p><p>When he arrived, he saw a carriage parked there and recognized it as belonging to Prince Li’s stablemaster. However, he hadn’t expected anyone to be in the carriage.</p><p>Since it wasn’t Prince Li, his identity was self-evident.</p><p>Gu Puwang said: "Are you Princess Consort of Prince Li?"</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a simple "Mm," answering gracefully. He then looked at Gu Puwang and asked, "And you?"</p><p>Just as he spoke, a shout rang out from not far away.</p><p>"Gu Puwang—!"</p><p>"You’re fishing? Get back here to shoot arrows!"</p><p>Gu Puwang smiled slightly. "This is indeed Gu Puwang."</p><p>He paused for a moment before speaking sincerely: "The Sixth Prince said that you are quite interesting yesterday. I see now that it is true."</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan with admiration, almost bursting with mutual respect and understanding. If anyone else had been praised so highly by the proud and talented Gu Puwang, they would have been overjoyed. However, after hearing his introduction, Jiang Juan showed no signs of surprise or delight.</p><p>Jiang Juan was completely stunned.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Gu Puwang? Why is it Gu Puwang?</p><p>How could he be here?</p><p>Jiang Juan was incomparably shocked, but no matter how shocked she was, it couldn't change the fact that she had inadvertently interacted with one of the members of &#58964;&#8204;gang again. Moreover, because they were both "slackers," she even gained the other's recognition.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>This is too absurd.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't come to terms with it. At this moment, the person who had just called out Gu Puwang arrived, "Gu Puwang, why are you still standing there? Come—"</p><p>Meng Qingliang hadn't finished speaking when he saw Jiang Juan slumped over the car window and was stunned, then asked her, "What are you doing here too?"</p><p>After Meng Qingliang realized what was happening, based on his rich experience of being forced to jump into lakes, he looked around left and right and said with certainty, "You must have come with His Royal Highness the Prince, where is His Royal Highness?"</p><p>Jiang Juan also wanted to know where His Royal Highness was. He had slept for so long but still hadn't returned, so she replied, "His Royal Highness is busy."</p><p>"That's perfect," Meng Qingliang said, "Come, we'll be having an archery competition later; you can join us too."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could things keep looping back to the starting point.</p><p>He wanted to shake his head, but Meng Qingliang didn't give him any chance to refuse. "Get in the car quickly, hurry up, hurry up! When I win against Qiu Lu Bai later, I'll split half a barrel with you."</p><p>Jiang Juan still wasn't very eager to move, but Gu Puwang said softly, "The Sixth Prince has set up a rest area for people. There are fans and umbrellas held by servants, and cold drinks and food to eat."</p><p>Sure enough, the salted fish understood salted fish best; Jiang Juan immediately changed his mind, "I'll come."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang walked away after speaking, not hearing the conversation between the two people. He shouted at Jiang Juan to come play with him, purely because he had a greatly improved opinion of Jiang Juan from their last encounter in the palace.</p><p>——He hadn't even taken two steps when Jiang Qingliang realized a big problem.</p><p>Gu Puwang was easy-going, and he didn't care if Jiang Qingliang brought Jiang Juan. However, the Prince Consort was like a firecracker; those few days after Conge fell into the water, he had been itching for trouble every day. Who knows what might happen when he saw Jiang Juan?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang thought and thought again, not wanting to be troubled again, and turned to Jiang Juan: "If the Prince Consort does something, remember to hide behind me."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked bewildered, "Huh?"</p><p>As it turned out, Jiang Qingliang's prediction was spot-on. The moment Xue Congjun saw Jiang Juan, he exploded.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, "I..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was afraid that Xue Congjun would do something to Jiang Juan, leading to another punishment from the Li Prince, so he hurriedly explained, "I brought him here to play."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "??"</p><p>Had he not explained, it wouldn't have been an issue. But his explanation only made Xue Congjun's eyes widen in disbelief as he accused Jiang Juan, "He brought you here? Why?"</p><p>Xue Congjun was clearly upset, and Jiang Qingliang initially thought he was defending Conge, criticizing him for being unfair. He quickly prepared a speech, something like—</p><p>I think he is quite good.</p><p>There shouldn't be any misunderstandings between him and Conge.</p><p>But before he could say anything, Xue Congjun blurted out one sentence angrily, accusing Jiang Juan, "Why didn't you come when I brought you here, but you came when he invited you to play?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang walked away after speaking without hearing the conversation between the two people. He had invited Jiang Juan to play purely because of his greatly improved opinion of him from their last encounter in the palace.</p><p>—He hadn't taken even two steps when Jiang Qingliang realized a big problem: Gu Puwang was an easygoing person, and he didn't mind if Jiang Qingliang brought Jiang Juan along. However, the Prince Consort was like a firecracker; those few days after Conge had fallen into the water, he had been itching for trouble every day. Who knew what might happen when he saw Jiang Juan?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang thought and thought again, not wanting to be troubled once more. He turned to Jiang Juan and said, "If the Prince Consort does anything, remember to hide behind me."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked bewildered and asked, "Huh?"</p><p>As it turned out, Jiang Qingliang's prediction was spot-on. The moment Xue Congjun saw Jiang Juan, he exploded.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and stammered, "I..."</p><p>Fearing that Xue Congjun would do something to Jiang Juan, leading to another punishment from the Li Prince, Jiang Qingliang hurriedly explained, "I brought him here to play."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "??" </p><p>Had he not explained, it wouldn't have been an issue.

"</p><p>I'm a little thirsty and want some ice.</p><p>After a few seconds of contemplation, Jiang Qingliang also realized it. He glared at Xue Congjun and slowly said, "Well then, Xue Congjun, you always talk about standing up for Niege, but in secret, you were secretly looking for Li Wangfei!"</p><p>Pausing momentarily, Jiang Qingliang boasted, "And guess what? She didn't even reply to you; she came with me instead."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>This injustice was too much for Xue Congjun to bear. He turned his head and glared at Jiang Juan again, "Why did you come with him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>If he were to explain it truthfully, he would say he followed Gu Puwang, but Jiang Juan's intuition told him that being honest might escalate the situation further. He blinked a few times without saying anything.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Qingliang, in his contrarian spirit, decided to join the fray, "Why can't he come with me too?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang retorted vehemently, "And my fifth brother is also my cousin, so she is my cousin-sister too!"</p><p>"Cousin or not," Xue Congjun sneered, "she is my dear sister-in-law."</p><p>"So what if she's a cousin-sister?" Jiang Qingliang was all in now, "She's even my father!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "? ? ?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was shocked and said, "I'm not saying I don't have one, but stop randomly claiming to be someone's dad."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang reminded him, "That day at Miaolin Temple, didn't I say that if you pushed me into the water, I would call you dad."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Shit, there really was such a thing.</p><p>He choked speechless. Xue Congjun scolded, "Dad, you fool, why did you shout it in front of the general! The general would definitely have beaten your head off!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was not at all flustered, "Anyway, I brought him here, and he is my best friend!"</p><p>The two glared at each other, unable to convince the other. Just as they were at an impasse, Gu Puwang calmly spoke up, "Why don't you two go have a shooting match? Whoever hits the target best, the Empress Consort will choose that one."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "Alright."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Let's go?"</p><p>The two accepted Gu Puwang's suggestion and stopped quarreling, rushing off. Each took a bow and arrow, truly ready to have a match.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What are these two actually emulating?</p><p>"Finally quiet," Gu Puwang turned to Jiang Juan, "Want some iced drink?"</p><p>He extended an invitation like a piece of salted fish, which Jiang Juan happily accepted, "Alright."</p><p>Gu Puwang did not mind the coldness at all. After finishing the plum blossom juice, he leaned against a tree and said to Jiang Juan, "Do as you please."</p><p>He lowered his head slightly and fell asleep again.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He behaved like a lazy fish but still had some standards. This wasn't in a carriage, so even if Jiang Juan wanted to lie down with him, she couldn't get past the mental barrier in her mind. He then found something to do for himself.</p><p>Looking left and right, Jiang Juan picked up a bow and arrow. She didn't know how to shoot arrows, so she just raised it and played around aimlessly.</p><p>Suddenly, a hand with clear finger joints and pale skin reached out, followed by someone bending over him. The man's voice was deep and cool, "Your position is incorrect."</p><p>"This finger, and this one—"</p><p>Jiang Juan's clean fingers were individually pressed into place by the other person, who separated his fingers and guided them onto the string but didn't let go, maintaining a tight grip with all five fingers.</p><p>"Prince Wang, you're back."</p><p>Jiang Juan perked up, intending to turn around, but another hand grabbed her chin, preventing her from doing so. Xue Fangli said behind her, "Teaching you how to shoot arrows."</p><p>He nearly embraced Jiang Juan as he finished speaking, releasing his grip on her chin and covering her hand that was holding the bow with his own. He then pulled back slightly, drawing the bowstring.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't pay much attention to learning and, not allowed to turn around, looked up instead, saying lightly, "Prince Wang, where have you been? I've missed you for a long time."</p><p>When he looked up, the line of his shoulders and neck was particularly beautiful. He had just woken up, so his hair at the temples was slightly messy, making him look drowsy in an enticing way.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, suppressing his displeasure and pretending to be casual, "Didn't this prince tell you what to do when he left?"</p><p>Jiang Juan recalled but came up empty-handed; she really had forgotten. "What did you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli narrowed his eyes, "This prince told you to wait for me in the carriage."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh," "I was originally in the carriage, but I woke up several times, and Prince Wang didn't return."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled faintly and said to him: "Strange, this king?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him innocently without saying anything, but her meaning was clear.</p><p>——Or what?</p><p>Flirting again.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond further; instead, he released the hand he was holding and said to Jiang Juan, "Try it yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah? I don't know how."</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "I just taught you how to hold a bow and pull the string."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied confidently, "It's true that we were talking at the time; I didn't pay attention."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "This king will teach you again."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Do you not want to learn?"</p><p>He had been idle and playing around anyway. If he really made her learn, Jiang Juan thought it would hurt her hands. Seeing him shake his head, Xue Fangli said mockingly, "If you don't want to learn, why are you in the carriage?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I—"</p><p>She wanted to say that she was also called over, but since the Prince seemed to be upset about her getting out of the carriage, Jiang Juan did not continue.</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "Hmm? What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was still thinking of an excuse when not far away, Xue Congyun and Jiang Qingliang finished their match. It seemed that Jiang Qingliang had won; he shouted loudly, "Big Brother Juan, I won! Wait a minute, after this, I'll bring you the Autumn Dew White!"</p><p>Xue Congyun lost the archery match but refused to admit defeat verbally, "Who gave you permission to call him Big Brother Juan? He's my Big Brother Juan! Even if you win, I'm still the first best with my Big Brother Juan. Go off to one side!"</p><p>The First Best?</p><p>Xue Fanglei lowered his eyelids, saying with a half-smile, "This Wang did not know when you became so close to them."</p><p>Jiang Juan said earnestly, "I am not familiar with them."</p><p>Xue Fanglei: "Really?"</p><p>Just as Jiang Juan was about to nod, Xue Fanglei grasped both of his hands, drew the bow, and let it fly. "Whoosh," an arrow shot out.</p><p>The sound of the arrow piercing through the air made Xue Congyun jump in fright. "Thump," the arrow brushed past his face and hit the bullseye precisely.</p><p>Xue Congyun was completely stunned. After a while, he reacted, jumped up, and was about to curse, "Who is that, do you not—"</p><p>He looked up and saw it was his fifth brother, Xue Congyun shuddered, forcing himself to swallow the words "eyes" and greeted him with a forced smile, "Fifth Brother, you came."</p><p>Xue Congyun held back his anger for a long time but could no longer restrain himself. He glared at Xue Fanglei resentfully, "Fifth Brother, I did nothing, why did your arrow target me?"</p><p>Xue Fanglei raised his eyelids and looked at him indifferently, saying, "You take the first step with your left foot."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "? ? ?"</p><p>As he spoke, he casually glanced at Jiang Qingliang. Jiang Qingliang's body stiffened as he turned to look at the nearby stream. This scene was too familiar for him, so much so that without Xue Fanglei saying a word, Jiang Qingliang instinctively opened his mouth.</p><p>"Your Highness, did your bracelet also fall here? I'll go find it for you."</p><p>With that, "splash," Jiang Qingliang jumped into the water. The routine was so familiar that it was heart-wrenching to watch.</p><p>Only then did Xue Fanglei slowly retract his gaze. He had intended to take Jiang Juan away, but his eyes fell upon him again.</p><p>Jiang Juan's brows furrowed slightly, as if he were pondering something.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan turned to Xue Fangli and asked, "Your Highness, were you deliberately scaring Prince Liu earlier?"</p><p>Xue Fangli simply responded with a "hm" and said coolly, "He was too noisy."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and then slowly continued, "Before that—on the day of our wedding, when I just got into the carriage, you also shot several arrows at me. Were you deliberately scaring me as well?"</p>
