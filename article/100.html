						<p>Jin Jun that little slut was getting ready to put on her makeup. You could use your strong purchasing power to buy her out. What did his fifth brother hate the most?</p><p>Xue Congjun was stunned for a moment, and then he realized belatedly that he had inadvertently offended his fifth brother by being too proud.</p><p>Rules.</p><p>His fifth brother was described by the Empress Dowager as an unruly bastard.</p><p>"Five, Fifth Brother, I forgot," Xue Congjun moved his lips, terrified, and quickly explained, "And this marriage, Fifth Brother wasn't satisfied with it either? I only... only..."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "That is this king's affair. What does it have to do with you?"</p><p>Xue Congjun stammered, "I... I..."</p><p>Xue Congjun was terrified by his brother's half-smile, and Zhang Gonggong wasn't much better off. He hadn't expected that his flattery would backfire. He immediately knelt on the ground, trying to please him, "Your Highness, with your magnanimity, you must not be paying attention—"</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed, and Zhang Gonggong's body stiffened instantly as he reached out to slap himself, "Forgive me, Your Highness! It was my fault for speaking out of turn!"</p><p>"Slap, slap, slap——!"</p><p>The slapping sound never ceased. Zhang Gonggong struck very hard, not daring to hold back at all. His face felt searingly painful, and his head buzzed, but he could not stop the movements of his hand.</p><p>"Magnanimity?" Xue Fangli spoke slowly, "Did eunuch Zhang get it wrong? This king has always been ruthless in punishing offenses."</p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Gonggong shuddered all over. He hurriedly crawled towards Xue Fangli on hands and knees, tears streaming down his face as he pleaded, "Forgive me, Your Highness! Forgive me—ah!"</p><p>Xue Fangli kicked him away, and Zhang Gonggong's voice changed pitch. Xue Fangli said coolly, "Men, pull out this dog eunuch's tongue, sew up his mouth, and hang him from the beam."</p><p>The guards acted on the order, rushing forward to apprehend him. Zhang Gonggong kept retreating but it was no use. His shoulders were held down, and Zhang, full of fear, blurted out, "Your Highness, the Emperor sent me! The Emperor! If I don't return, what will the Emperor think?"</p><p>Xue Fangli remained unmoved, looking down at him disdainfully as he sighed, "Truly pitiful."</p><p>"A mere slave," Xue Fangli said, "What would His Majesty think? This King is merely teaching you the rules."</p><p>As he spoke, Zhang Gonggong was surrounded by a group of people. Sword lights flashed before his face, and his legs gave way as his complexion turned gray.</p><p>He was done for.</p><p>Xue Congjun stood there in shock. Xue Fangli seemed to remember him and said apologetically, "Sixth Brother is an honored guest; he hasn't even had a sip of tea. This King has failed in hospitality."</p><p>Xue Congjun was trembling like a magpie, waving his hands hastily to decline any offer, for he now only wanted to escape.</p><p>"Serve Sixth Brother some tea," Xue Fangli ignored him, "I remember that just now, Sixth Brother said that the Empress Dowager was dressed simply and was bringing bad luck."</p><p>Xue Congjun tried to defend himself, "What I meant was..."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, "Did this King hear wrong?"</p><p>Reluctantly, Xue Congjun answered truthfully, "N-no."</p><p>A maid came forward to pour the tea. Xue Fangli smiled again, "Why is Sixth Brother so nervous? Sit down and drink your tea."</p><p>Xue Congjun stared at the cup of tea, his scalp tingling.</p><p>During their conversation, Zhang Gonggong had already been hung upside down from the ceiling, directly opposite the seat beside the teacup. His face was covered in blood, making him look horrifying. He was still writhing in agony as blood continued to drip into the cup.</p><p>The red spread out, covering the entire surface of the tea.</p><p>Xue Congjun dared not provoke Xue Fangli any further. He stiffly sat down, completely unwilling to touch that cup of tea.</p><p>Xue Fangli, however, calmly asked him, "Why isn't Sixth Brother drinking his tea? Doesn't he like it?"</p><p>Under his gaze, Xue Congjun had no choice but to force himself to swallow the tea in the cup despite his nausea. Then he forced a smile, uglier than crying, and said, "I drank it, Fifth Brother. I like it; I finished it all."</p><p>Xue Fangli heard the words and nodded in satisfaction. He stared at the bloodstains on the ground and asked Xue Congjun, "Younger Brother Liu, are you still having bad luck?"</p><p>Xue Congjun shook his head wildly, "No, not at all!"</p><p>"That's good," Xue Fangli glanced at him and gave a dismissal, "It's getting late. Younger Brother Liu should go home."</p><p>Xue Congjun was overjoyed and jumped up immediately, "I'll leave right away!"</p><p>But after taking a few steps, he was called back, "Wait."</p><p>Xue Congjun was startled and slowly turned his head, "Elder Brother Wu?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "His Majesty the Emperor sent you to attend the ceremony. Didn't Younger Brother Liu bring any gifts?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Of course not. However, before leaving the palace, Xue Congjun finally managed to coax from His Majesty the Emperor the cherished seashell nightingale he had long desired—a statue of a bird housed within a seashell that over time developed an opalescent luster.</p><p>This thing was incredibly intricate and required both time and effort to make. To date, only a few were in His Majesty's possession, and this particular one was the most beautiful. Xue Congjun had originally planned to play with it for a few days before giving it to his elder brother Nian, even notifying him in advance.</p><p>But now...</p><p>"Here I am," Xue Congjun did not dare say he came empty-handed; tears of frustration welled up as he fished out the seashell nightingale, which he hadn't had time to warm up yet. "This—I begged Father for it."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't even glance at it and said, "Younger Brother Liu has good intentions."</p><p>Xue Congjun felt heartache but forced a smile, "Elder Brother Wu likes it then."</p><p>At this point, Xue Congjun suddenly remembered something, "Oh right, Elder Brother Wu, since the wedding is settled, don't forget to visit Father in the palace tomorrow."</p><p>Xue Fangli merely responded with an indifferent "Mm."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. Beneath his weary expression lay a chilling coldness. "Take them away."</p><p>His attitude towards rewards was no secret to Gao Guanshi, who was just about to call for someone when Xue Fangli changed his mind. He said thoughtfully, "Since they are gifts, give them to Third Young Master."</p><p>"Tianxian," Xue Fangli recalled Xue Congjun's description of Jiang Juan's face, which truly seemed otherworldly, as if he had no desires or needs. With great interest, he said, "This King wants to see if he is really indifferent to worldly matters."</p><p>Gao Guanshi accepted the order. He had initially thought that His Highness was quite fond of this Third Young Master, but now it seemed that the Third Young Master merely happened to pique His Highness's interest.</p><p>The person who last caught His Highness's interest had a grave so tall with grass that it was already three zhang high.</p><p>Gao Guanshi shook his head.</p><p>Xue Fangli threw another small object over. "Send this bivalve cricket along too."</p><p>No matter how peculiar the items from the palace were, Gao Guanshi found them uninteresting. As soon as he took it, he began to busy himself with it. Xue Congjun could no longer bear to listen and felt his heart being torn apart.</p><p>Giving that hick.</p><p>Not only did Father Emperor's gifts along with his bivalve cricket go to that hick.</p><p>Why was he so jealous?</p><p>Of course, after being severely beaten up, Xue Congjun was not very daring to do much. His intention was quite humble.</p><p>—to see his bivalve cricket one last time.</p><p>If he could touch it again, that would be even better.</p><p>Wuwuwu.</p><p>Jiang Juan was sent back to his room.</p><p>The servant pushed open the door, and someone hurriedly rushed in, anxiously asking Jiang Juan, "Young Master, are you alright?"</p><p>Her voice sounded familiar. Jiang Juan looked a few times and recognized her as the maid who had begged for mercy when he woke up. Jiang Juan thought for a moment that this maid should be Lan Ting. In the book, Lan Ting had been by Jiang Juan's side since they were in the countryside with his grandfather.</p><p>The servant brought him to the room and closed the door. Jiang Juan shook his head and replied, "I'm fine."</p><p>However, Lan Ting was still very upset, "When has Young Master ever suffered such an injustice?"</p><p>At this point, Lan Ting's mood became even more depressed, "Master wouldn't even send a few more people to serve Young Master."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't quite understand these things. Since he was full of doubts, he asked Lan Ting, "Do you know what kind of person Prince Li is?"</p><p>Lan Ting had come from the countryside with him and therefore didn't know much about it, but she had heard some things about Prince Li. She whispered, "The maid heard... The Prince is cruel and ruthless, having killed many people for no reason."</p><p>It matched the novel, but Jiang Juan was still puzzled.</p><p>Today, Prince Li's attitude had been very good. Not only did he consider Young Master's feelings, even when Young Master was being interrogated, he said that he believed in him. He was completely—</p><p>Jiang Juan: "But I think he's a good person."</p><p>Lan Ting exclaimed "Ah," and Jiang Juan couldn't help but guess, "He is described as so terrifying; could it be a misinterpretation?"</p><p>Lan Ting had no idea and said uncertainly, "Possible?"</p><p>Perhaps, he had been maligned by rumors?</p><p>Outside the door, the senior official paused, about to knock.</p><p>A good person?</p><p>Their Prince?</p><p>Senior Official: "?"</p><p>There was a slight crack in his expression.</p><p>After a while, the senior official knocked on the door with mixed feelings. Lan Ting quickly opened it. The senior official said respectfully, "Princess Consort, His Highness the Prince asked me to bring several boxes of gifts for you. You may take whatever you like, Princess Consort."</p><p>He then presented the gift list, "Princess Consort, you may check them one by one according to this list."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down at the list. The writing was dense and messy. He could barely make out a few lines.</p><p>Jade lotus.</p><p>Emerald mandarin fish.</p><p>Coral green parrot.</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Looking at the name, it belonged to a museum's prized collection.</p><p>He then looked at the box. Perhaps due to jolts during transport, he could vaguely see a vibrant green that was almost painful to behold. Jiang Juan was nearly stabbed in the eyes by this imperial green.</p><p>It was too precious; Jiang Juan dared not accept it and shook his head hurriedly, "I don't need it, I really don't need anything. Please take it back."</p><p>The high official looked at him a few times and said with a wry smile, "Princess, do not make things difficult for your servant. Items given by the Prince, if your servant takes them back, he would be the one in trouble."</p><p>It seemed impolite to return it directly. Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment before saying, "Then leave it here for now."</p><p>The high official nodded and added, "Prince had a severe cough last night and was afraid that Princess might not sleep well. He has already rested in another room. Tonight... Princess need not wait for Prince to return to his chambers."</p><p>Jiang Juan was not at all surprised.</p><p>It was the same in the novel. In the main character's memories, he also slept separately from Li Wang on their wedding night.</p><p>"Oh right, the Prince asked your servant to convey a matter," the high official said, "Princess needs to accompany Prince into the palace to meet the Emperor tomorrow morning."</p><p>"Alright, I understand."</p><p>After settling everything, the high official left without lingering, bowing and departing. Jiang Juan held the gift list and continued reading. The more he read, the more astonished he became, feeling that his guesses were on point.</p><p>Li Wang was truly a great person.</p><p>He had helped him so much and even given him such precious items.</p><p>However, according to the plot, Li Wang would die tomorrow night.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Juan could no longer bear to look at the gift list in his hand.</p><p>He remembered that Li Wang died of an acute illness. Even if the imperial doctors arrived in time, they could not save him.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and suddenly felt a bit of remorse.</p><p>But he couldn't help her much either.</p><p>Jiang Juan made his decision.</p><p>From now on, every anniversary, he would burn more paper money for Xue Fangli, making him the richest ghost king in the entire underworld.</p><p>Xue Congjun burst into laughter again. Even a dried fish couldn't endure it, so Jiang Juan decided to hurt him back.</p><p>"This is what you call good stuff?" Jiang Juan said with a sullen tone. "That's all? I've seen many things like this and they aren't particularly impressive."</p><p>The little gadget was indeed ingenious, but before he read the book, Jiang Juan had enjoyed visiting museums, so when he said he'd seen many similar items, it wasn't purely to hurt Xue Congjun; he genuinely had.</p><p>Sure enough, Xue Congjun couldn't laugh anymore when he heard this.</p><p>Since childhood, he had a strong desire for winning and losing, and as a prince, no one ever dared to say his things weren't good. Almost everyone went along with him, except Jiang Juan who constantly got under his skin.</p><p>Xue Congjun was about to explode again. "What do you mean 'that's all'? Take a good look at it. Its craftsmanship, its charm—unique in the world, isn't it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down and said slowly, "Mmm, pretty good."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Damn, he felt like he was being brushed off again.</p><p>He took a deep breath; if the golden cicada jade leaf didn't work, there was still a jade green peacock. Xue Congjun carefully retrieved the jade green peacock and asked, "What about this one?"</p><p>Pointing to the color of the peacock feathers, afraid Jiang Juan wouldn't recognize it, he explained specially, "This is called Wufu Linmen—such a small piece of jade combining five colors; do you know how rare it is?"</p><p>It was indeed rare, and besides, the peacock was beautifully carved. However, Jiang Juan still used his bluffing technique, "Ah, I see, I understand."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>No, you don't understand.</p><p>Shouldn't understanding its preciousness mean you can start praising it?</p><p>Feeling unfulfilled by her vanity, Xue Congyun glared at Jiang Juan and could only vent her rage helplessly: "What's wrong with you? You're not reacting at all! It's nothing special. I think you just don't know what good things are!"</p><p>Xue Congyun cursed, "You stinking country bumpkin, look at it properly again!"</p><p>She angrily handed the emerald peacock to Jiang Juan, almost wanting to force Jiang Juan's head down to examine it, determined that Jiang Juan would see something wonderful today.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at her, knowing that continuing to tease her might get him into trouble. He finally told the truth: "I was kidding you. These two items are good stuff."</p><p>After speaking, he smiled, his soft lips curling slightly. Beneath the wet eyelashes, his eyes shimmered with moisture, and at this moment, the youth's expression was vibrant.</p><p>Xue Congyun was stunned. He should have been angry after being tricked, but upon seeing Jiang Juan smile, all his anger melted away. She muttered hoarsely: "I told you..."</p><p>Although the process wasn't smooth, the result was satisfactory. Xue Congyun's vanity had finally been satisfied. She waved her hand dismissively and said, "Since you recognize good things, they're yours."</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't accept this and declined: "No thank you, it's too valuable."</p><p>"Valuable?" Hearing this, Xue Congyun was even more elated. She pretended to be indifferent and said, "Items of such quality are plenty in my warehouse. Once I take them out, there's no way I'd put them back. You keep them."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Is the Sixth Prince a reincarnation of a money-spender?</p><p>Jiang Juan was at a loss for words. However, he suddenly remembered a plot twist.</p><p>—The main character receives a birthday gift.</p><p>According to tradition, young people should not have birthday celebrations, but the main character was a family favorite, and he could not resist his friends' insistence and the Duke of Peace's desire to host one for him.</p><p>On that day, the festivities were quite grand. First, three close friends of the main character—Prince Ling, son of the Chancellor, and son of the General—came to bring gifts.</p><p>All three came from wealthy backgrounds and were generous with their offerings, especially Prince Ling, who seemed ready to empty his treasury.</p><p>The Duke of Peace was naturally not one to be outdone. The main character's future wife was a lady of the Shangshu Mansion, and this was the last birthday celebration he would have there. Therefore, he prepared "ten-mile gifts," which became a topic of much discussion in the capital city.</p><p>However, although the Duke of Peace gave generously, he did not match Prince Ling's refinement. One of Prince Ling's gifts even played a crucial role in subsequent events.</p>
