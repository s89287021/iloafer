						<p>His gaze was dark and deep, impenetrable.</p><p>At this moment, even the slow-witted Jiang Juan detected a hint of danger.</p><p>——The Prince seemed to want to tear him apart and devour him.</p><p>Jiang Juan stammered, “I don’t know.”</p><p>Tracing his finger over the soft lips of the youth, Xue Fangli said leisurely, “If you don’t know… then…”</p><p>“I will ask for whatever I want from you, my lord.”</p><p>With that, Xue Fangli leaned in. His aggressive aura was too overwhelming, making Jiang Juan instinctively feel uneasy. With each step forward, Jiang Juan took a step back, until he found himself trapped on the soft cushion, with no place to run.</p><p>“My lord…”</p><p>Xue Fangli pressed closer, and Jiang Juan pleaded for mercy.</p><p>At this moment, the youth lay on the bed, his hair spread out like well-groomed silk, its sweet fragrance wafting through the air. Jiang Juan was extremely nervous but helpless, only able to gaze at Xue Fangli in a state of bewilderment and anxiety.</p><p>“Call me husband,” Xue Fangli’s voice was hoarse.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn’t dare think about many things, but in this moment, even without thinking, he intuitively knew how to avoid danger—like now, he couldn’t call him husband. Jiang Juan felt inexplicably that if he did so, the Prince would really tear him apart and devour him.</p><p>“… You don’t look at me.”</p><p>Jiang Juan omitted any formalities and raised his hand, the wide sleeves of his robe bunching up at his elbows. He covered Xue Fangli’s eyes with his clean fingers and whispered, “It feels like you’re going to eat me.”</p><p>“You’re not very tasty.”</p><p>“How are you not tasty?” Xue Fangli grabbed both of his wrists. “I’m the one who has tasted it.”</p><p>The next second, Jiang Juan's two hands were suddenly pressed down, Xi Fangli smiled nonchalantly, "If it wasn't delicious, how could this king savor its essence and still want to taste a few more bites?"</p><p>His experience referred to the unconventional method of taking medicine he had just undergone. Jiang Juan realized this, and his fingers involuntarily curled up. His already pink fingertips turned even redder, shocking in their intensity.</p><p>Pressed onto the bed, Jiang Juan couldn't move at all. He could only ask Xi Fangli, "Your Highness, what are you doing?"</p><p>Xi Fangli said slowly, "Asking for payment."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied with an "oh," forcing himself to appear calm as he asked, "What kind of payment?"</p><p>"Don't you know?"</p><p>Xi Fangli's tone was casual, but Jiang Juan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"N-no, I don't know."</p><p>Xi Fangli commented, "Not only timid, but also likes to pretend to be stupid. Does this king really do anything that you truly don't know?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "I don't know means I don't know."</p><p>Xi Fangli smiled enigmatically, "If you don't know, then so be it. You'll know soon enough."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned and before he could think, Xi Fangli moved closer to him.</p><p>The two of them drew ever nearer, Jiang Juan completely trapped in his embrace with no place to retreat or hide, even his hands were firmly pressed down.</p><p>Panicked, Jiang Juan tried to escape in shame but found it effective. He closed his eyes.</p><p>—As long as he couldn't see what happened next, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Jiang Juan was too nervous; his eyelashes flicked, and water droplets on his face trembled like the delicate and wet petals of a flower swaying in the wind.</p><p>It itched at his heart and made it soft, also silently revealing much.</p><p>The youth was afraid.</p><p>He was not ready yet.</p><p>He...</p><p>Xue Fangli slightly tilted his head, leaning close to Jiang Juan's ear and lazily asked him, "How long do you want to hide?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Hm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not respond. He even wanted to ask Wang Ye what he was hiding from, but Wang Ye was too dangerous at that moment. Jiang Juan chose to reclaim his hand, hugging him tightly and hiding himself in his embrace.</p><p>This should not be.</p><p>Jiang Juan was too anxious.</p><p>He was very, very anxious.</p><p>There were so many things he dared not think about.</p><p>Only one thing, Jiang Juan was very clear about.</p><p>No matter what the Prince did to him, Jiang Juan would not hate it; in fact, he would accept everything without complaint.</p><p>Because the Prince would never harm him.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan slowly revealed half his face and gently grabbed Xue Fangli's fingers, then let out a soft sigh.</p><p>How strange.</p><p>It was the Prince who put him in danger, yet it was also the Prince who provided him with safety.</p><p>Why would the Prince be so troublesome?</p><p>Feeling a slight touch, Xue Fangli glanced at him and held Jiang Juan's hand back, his voice seductive, "I have received my reward. Now, take the medicine."</p><p>He gave an evil smile, "As you wish, without using your fingers."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>He regretted it; he really regretted it.</p><p>But no matter how much he regretted, Jiang Juan was still pulled up and continued taking the medicine in this unusual way.</p><p>The night grew darker.</p><p>That night, the moon was full like a plate.</p><p>"Brother Jiang, I toast to you."</p><p>In another tent, Su Feiyue and Jiang Sentao—now the General of Flying Cavalry—were having a drink together. He raised his glass and gently clinked it with the other's, then took a deep sip and drained it. The two men set down their glasses and smiled at each other.</p><p>"A toast to a friend worth a thousand cups."</p><p>Su Feiyue sighed softly. Jiang Sentao glanced at him and smiled as well. After a while, he said, "Brother Su, didn't you say you didn't want to work anymore and just wanted to live off others? Lately, whenever the emperor sends for you, you always show up, even at the imperial stables."</p><p>"I wish I could avoid the emperor, but there's no excuse left," Su Feiyue said regretfully. "I've used up all my excuses, and it's not good to be insincere. I can only pay homage to him."</p><p>Jiang Sentao laughed loudly. As a general with a bold personality, he shook his head and said, "The emperor has always valued you, both in the past and now. He often mentions you, speaking of you with regret."</p><p>Su Feiyue made no comment on this. After some time, he asked Jiang Sentao slowly, "Brother Jiang, have you ever hated him?"</p><p>His fingers trembled as he held his glass. Although it was an incomplete sentence, Jiang Sentao knew what he meant and said wistfully, "What can I hate? The situation is irreversible."</p><p>Su Feiyue replied coolly, "Don't you feel regret for Qinmei's loss?"</p><p>Years had passed, and hearing this name again from someone else made Jiang Sentao feel a sense of unfamiliarity. But the name still stirred a bitter feeling in his heart. "She..."</p><p>It was well-known that General Jiang's family had once had a daughter named Qinmei. She was extremely beautiful, the most stunning in the capital, but her life was tragically short. Not long after she left for the temple, she fell off a cliff when her horse was startled and her remains were never found. Since then, only sighs of pity remained.</p><p>But no one knew that on the day she died, a lonely girl named Yumei appeared in the palace.</p><p>"She shouldn't have been born in the Jiang family."</p><p>After a long pause, Jiang Sentao finally spoke.</p><p>Sighing, Su Feiyue patted Jiang Sentao's shoulder. "It wasn't your fault. You were at the border and had no idea what was happening."</p><p>Jiang Sentao replied bitterly, "How can I not blame myself? If I had received the letter earlier, if I had returned to the capital in time, Qinmei wouldn't have disappeared from our lives, Father wouldn't have knelt in the snow for so long, and in the end..."</p><p>He stumbled.</p><p>"General Jiang is truly a great loss."</p><p>The old man had not been in good health; perhaps this fall broke a bone, or it could have been due to his pent-up resentment. Not long after, General Jiang passed away.</p><p>"I mentioned this to the emperor a few times, and he did seem inclined to make Liwang crown prince."</p><p>Jiang Sentao shook his head. "No way, Liwang must not become crown prince."</p><p>Su Feiyue asked, "But aren't you blaming him for killing Xiu, which made Qingmei go downhill ever since, becoming mad?"</p><p>"It has nothing to do with that."</p><p>Jiang Sentao sighed, "Qingmei entered the palace already harboring resentment and vented all of it on Liwang. He grew up around her, only holding hatred in his heart—towards Qingmei, towards the emperor, throughout these years he never reconciled with either. If one day he ascends to power, filled with hate as he is, how can he show mercy to the people?"</p><p>"You Jiang family members truly..."</p><p>Su Feiyue was not surprised, "When the emperor first asked me for my opinion, I thought just like you."</p><p>Jiang Sentao asked him, "What do you think now?"</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled lightly, "His concubine is quite suitable to become empress."</p><p>"Why do you say so?"</p><p>Su Feiyue waved his hand. "It's useless to explain more to you; she is a likable child. If you have the time another day, talk to him and you'll see for yourself."</p><p>Li Wang was indeed of a tyrannical nature, heedless of human ethics. However, his empress seemed to be able to rein him in somewhat.</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled. Jiang Sentao suddenly remembered something. "You're right; I should meet with him personally."</p><p>"Zhong Ling Temple, I did run into him traveling with Li Wang, but the timing wasn't appropriate, so I only invited Li Wang alone, asking him to take good care of the empress. However, in truth, we've never met, and it's about time I inquire after his well-being and show more concern, given that my grandfather owes me a favor."</p><p>Su Feiyue snorted derisively. "General Jiang, you really have selective memory, haven't you? How long has it been since you last thought of showing more care for him?"</p><p>"It's fortunate that your nephew spoils him so much; otherwise, if that old man found out, he might really march into the capital city and see how you fare."</p><p>"I spend most of my days in the camp with very little leisure time."</p><p>Jiang Sentao smiled and poured himself a glass of wine. "Let's not talk about trivial matters; let's drink first."</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Last night, Yao had kept Jiang Juan up most of the night, so he went to sleep late as well. When his maid woke him up in the morning, Jiang Juan felt like he had only just fallen asleep.</p><p>Not having enough sleep was painful, and that was exactly how he felt. Jiang Juan sat up for a while but couldn't get comfortable, so he lay back down again. Before long, he found himself being pulled into someone's arms.</p><p>"Go back to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was calm. Jiang Juan responded with an "oh," nestled against him, closing his eyes as he rested his head on Xue Fangli's shoulder.</p><p>Pale and slender fingers brushed away the black hair piled on Jiang Juan's shoulders. Taking advantage of the moment, Xue Fangli also stroked his neck, but his peripheral vision caught sight of a young man with fair skin, save for one prominent red mole.</p><p>His movement paused as he rubbed that mole repeatedly.</p><p>Jiang Juan had always been sensitive to tickling, and his neck was even more so. Pushing away the king's annoying hand, it didn't take long for the hand to touch him again.</p><p>Interrupted sleep made Jiang Juan grumble, "Your Majesty, can you stop playing around and let me sleep?"</p><p>"You sleep, this king plays with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke in a leisurely tone, tinged with mockery. Jiang Juan could only cover his neck and struggle to fall asleep.</p><p>But the next second, his fingers were tightly held and then lifted. The man's fingertips repeatedly rubbed against his neck, making Jiang Juan itch uncontrollably. He could only push away the man's hand again.</p><p>"…Your Majesty."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his head. He had not slept well; he felt weak all over. He lazily said, "Can't you let me sleep? Can we play later when I wake up?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted an eyebrow slightly and lowered his voice, asking in a soft, slow manner, "Any way of playing is fine?"</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly became wary, "Don't—"</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan realized that the word 'play' was inappropriate. He changed his words, "You can touch me however you like."</p><p>"But compared to touching, this king wants to…"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his voice, "Bite a little."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>He said slowly, "Isn't that inappropriate?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and asked with a half-smile, "Didn't I give you medicine last night? Why don't you say it's inappropriate then?"</p><p>"But the medicine is a special case…"</p><p>The medicine was for a special situation. He feared pain, especially since the tender areas were already irritated; any touch would hurt, so he had to—</p><p>use an unconventional method of administering the medicine.</p><p>In the end, Jiang Juan himself lacked confidence. He did not want to be bitten and chose to get up early rather than continue sleeping or be played with by the Prince. </p><p>Jiang Juan had never gotten out of bed so quickly before, nor had he ever woken up this early without complaining. He sat down, and a maid came to comb his hair for him.</p><p>As she was combing his hair, the maid suddenly said, “Lady, do you remember that stable boy you saved yesterday?”</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, “Yes, I remember.”</p><p>Upon her mentioning it, Jiang Juan hurriedly asked her, “What happened to him?”</p><p>The maid replied, “He woke up yesterday and wanted to thank Lady, but was stopped by someone.”</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Oh," then he asked, "Could you tell him that there's nothing wrong and for him to be more careful in the future?"</p><p>The maid hesitated, “He came early this morning and wanted to thank Lady personally. Lady, will you see him?”</p><p>“If I don’t see him, my servant can relay your message to him.”</p><p>Seeing him wouldn't hurt; after all, the Prince had gotten into an argument with him over saving that person. Jiang Juan hesitated and asked Xue Fangli, “Prince, may I see him?”</p><p>Jiang Juan got out of bed, and Xue Fangli also sat up. Seeing Jiang Juan asking him, he reached out to pull Jiang Juan into his arms, saying lazily, "Why are you asking me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pinched his fingers, “You’re so hard to please; who would know if you care.”</p><p>“How should I flatter you, wouldn’t you know?”</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly and leaned in close to his ear, his voice low, “Didn't I just tell you what I wanted to do earlier?”</p><p>What did the Prince want to do?</p><p>To bite him.</p><p>"No, this really won't work."</p><p>Jiang Juan reined in his horse and said to the maid, "We still won't see him."</p><p>Xue Fali lowered his eyes and looked at him. Jiang Juan raised his head innocently and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"What do you mean by 'what's wrong'?"</p><p>Clear-jointed fingers lightly pinched Jiang Juan's face, as if punishing him, squishing his face into a ball. Jiang Juan was irritated and could only push his hand away again. Xue Fali then said, "Tell them to come in."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him and couldn't help but smile, "Your Highness, you are really good."</p><p>Thinking something wasn't right, Jiang Juan quickly added, "... except when you bully me."</p><p>Xue Fali didn't respond and only released the hand that had been pinching his face, turning to grab Jiang Juan's fingers instead.</p><p>Xue Fali gave an order, and the maid hurriedly walked outside the tent, whispering to someone, "Quickly bring that servant—Xie Baitu—Your Highness and Your Highness's Consort want to see him."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>Xie Baitu?</p><p>Why would it be Xie Baitu?</p><p>In the novel, Xie Baitu was a mere tool character.</p><p>Towards the middle and later stages, as circumstances changed and natural disasters and calamities occurred one after another, this Xie Baitu took center stage.</p><p>He had no interest in the Four Books and Five Classics but enjoyed reading miscellaneous books, especially those related to water conservancy. He even came up with quite a few inventions on his own.</p><p>In the original text, the protagonist, relying on a lifetime of memories, knew about this person. He personally visited Duke Pingan and even paid three visits to his humble abode before finally convincing Xie Baitu to come out of retirement.</p><p>It seemed to be... the stables.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>How did he seem to accidentally steal the main character's spotlight?</p>
