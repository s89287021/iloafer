						<p>Jiang Juan said strangely, "What's broken? I only bumped it slightly and it didn't break."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not comment, lowering his eyes. Jiang Juan had already rolled up his underwear very high; his body was well-proportioned, with slender and straight legs, except for one spot that had a tint of color.</p><p>——There was a faint pink on his knee.</p><p>He had only bumped it slightly, but the delicate flesh had been rubbed raw, though there was no bleeding. Xue Fangli still knelt down and picked up Jiang Juan, who was sitting on the ground.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "No blood? Should be... okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You also say 'okay'?"</p><p>There really wasn't anything serious; it just hurt a lot. Jiang Juan couldn't bear it anymore and sincerely complained, "It hurts so much."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Spoiled brat."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He shouldn't have spoken.</p><p>Xue Fangli put Jiang Juan on the bed and instructed without looking back, "Bring a basin of hot water and get some muscle balm."</p><p>The maidservant hurried away and soon brought everything over. Jiang Juan was busy taking off his shoes and socks, bending his leg to check if there were any injuries. Fortunately, only his knee had been rubbed; he felt relieved.</p><p>"Should we put medicine on this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan knew very well that his knee already hurt, and rubbing it would make it worse. He said, "It's getting dark, Your Highness, let's go see the fireworks."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond but took the wet towel from the maidservant and wiped Jiang Juan's knee. Before he could apply the ointment, Jiang Juan started pushing him away in fright. Xue Fangli restrained his wrist, rendering his hands useless; even his feet were about to kick out subconsciously.</p><p>He missed.</p><p>Jiang Juan's injured knee happened to be on the leg adorned with a small-leaf purple sandalwood Buddha bead. His ankle was grabbed by a hand, and his movement ceased. Only this string of beads swung incessantly at his ankle.</p><p>The dark wooden beads contrasted sharply with his fair skin, fitting Jiang Juan perfectly in their purity and dustlessness. Yet, they did not quite match him; the beads were slightly larger, as was the bracelet, silently declaring a certain sentiment.</p><p>— He had been taken off the wrist of his original owner and deliberately put on Jiang Juan's ankle.</p><p>The beads were sacred, yet now they swung constantly at Jiang Juan's ankle, conveying an unexpected sense of claiming ownership.</p><p>Scholar Xue Fangli watched as he grabbed Jiang Juan's ankle with one hand, stroking the beads. His fingers moved slowly over them, gently rolling the beads.</p><p>He was touching small-leaf purple sandalwood beads, but Jiang Juan felt itchy, his jade-like toes curling uncontrollably. He tried to retreat, but his ankle was gripped too tightly, and he could not pull away.</p><p>"Let go," he said softly.</p><p>Jiang Juan murmured, "This is so strange."</p><p>Scholar Xue Fangli asked, "What's strange?"</p><p>His tone was calm, and even as he spoke, he continued to stroke the beads, seemingly playing with them slowly. Yet, what he was really playing with didn't seem to be the beads; his gaze remained fixed on Jiang Juan's curled toes.</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "Everything is strange."</p><p>Scholar Xue Fangli asked, "Then how about this?"</p><p>His fingers slipped into the beads and rested on the ankle bone on the outer side of Jiang Juan's wrist.</p><p>The tip of his finger was slightly cold, but the moment it touched Jiang Juan, he felt a wave of heat. His reaction was like being scalded; he suddenly retracted, only to accidentally step into a basin of water placed on the floor with a splash.</p><p>"Slurp," water splashed everywhere, wetting Jiang Juan's leg and Scholar Xue Fangli's sleeves. At that moment, everything was silent except for the sound of water.</p><p>"It wasn't intentional."</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan felt guilty and finally spoke up. Xue Fangli looked at him but said nothing, only taking care of his knee.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not want to take the medicine; he just wanted to leave. He brought it up again, "My Lord, let's go see the fireworks."</p><p>What he was thinking, !zi4shang1!hao3cai2!, Xue Fangli looked over, waited for a while, and by then, the medicine had cooled down. Boiling it again would only make it even more fishy and bitter. Forcing him to drink it might make him bite !tia4n2!.</p><p>"Skip the tonic if you don't want to take it," Xue Fangli said slowly. "No matter how much you replenish, if your mood is bad, your heart condition will still flare up."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, pleased with his reasoning, "Mm, I can't get angry."</p><p>Xue Fangli added, "Take a bath first, then go see the fireworks."</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to !jiu4! come back and say something, but he was afraid of missing out. "I don't——"</p><p>Before he could finish, Xue Fangli glanced at him coldly and asked, "Drenched all over, do you want to catch a chill? You can skip the tonic, but if you catch a chill, every dose of medicine must be !song2! !song2! !zi4shang1! !zi4shang1! taken."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He was intimidated and quickly put on his shoes, letting one of the maids lead him to take a bath.</p><p>After changing into clean clothes and getting himself ready, Jiang Juan urgently urged Xue Fangli, "My Lord, let's go see the fireworks."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Go ahead."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to pull him along, but Xue Fangli remained still. Jiang Juan looked back in confusion, and he said coolly, "Did !wang2! I ever promise to watch with you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?!"</p><p>No way, making him dilly-dally for so long, the Lord must go. Jiang Juan glanced at him slowly and asked, "My Lord, aren't you going?"</p><p>"If My Lord doesn't go, I'll be in a bad mood. If I'm in a bad mood, my heart condition might flare up. And if my heart condition flares up, you won't have peace either."</p><p>This is not a reminder but an open threat.</p><p>Under the dim light, the young man's eyelashes fluttered, his eyes sparkling with vitality. Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time; no matter how unsatisfied or irritated he was, all those turbulent emotions dissipated at this moment, almost melting into the gaze of the youth.</p><p>"Disturbing this king..."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised the corners of his lips and smiled softly, "Then I will have to go."</p><p>In the dark of night, a loud boom echoed, and the fireworks exploded into the sky. Sitting in the carriage, Jiang Juan could only see a few falling tails.</p><p>"It has started."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his head, "Your Highness, look quick."</p><p>Xue Fangli had little interest in fireworks; while Jiang Juan was watching them, he was observing Jiang Juan. Xue Fangli asked, "Do you like to watch fireworks?"</p><p>Jiang Juan murmured a "mhm."</p><p>He was not in good health and looked forward to the New Year's Eve fireworks every year, wanting to go to the scene, but the night of the new year was always crowded and bustling, and his heart was too fragile. So he could only watch them on live stream.</p><p>The fireworks lasted for quite a while, as did Jiang Juan's gaze fixed on the falling tails. He still felt somewhat disappointed, leaning despondently against the window, asking Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, are we back at the Wangfu now?"</p><p>Xue Fangli sized him up with his eyes and asked calmly, "Don't want to watch anymore?"</p><p>Realizing what he meant, Jiang Juan was taken aback, "Ah? Are there more?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately perked up, "I want to see more. I really do."</p><p>It started again! The Young Master was starting his routine once more!</p><p>—Upon the arrival of the Lady Wang in front of Phoenix Avenue, he was going to get fireworks and make her see them enough!</p><p>Phoenix Avenue was the most bustling market in Jing, where a Phoenix Tower was built for people to look far into the distance.</p><p>The carriage stopped nearby, but Jiang Juan did not feel like getting out.</p><p>"It's so high."</p><p>Jiang Juan only wanted to watch the fireworks and had no intention of climbing up the tower. He earnestly said, "Young Master, you can just watch from inside the carriage; there's no need to go up there."</p><p>Xue Fangli was unmoved, "Get down."</p><p>After hesitating for a long time, Jiang Juan reluctantly held out his hand as Xue Fangli reached for him. Slowly, he stepped out of the carriage, but before his foot could touch the ground, Xue Fangli suddenly pulled him in.</p><p>He was dragged into his arms.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and quickly hugged him tightly.</p><p>It was nice to avoid work, but the Phoenix Tower was too tall. Jiang Juan was a bit scared and said anxiously, "Young Master, put me down; I want to walk by myself."</p><p>"Walk by yourself?" Xue Fangli glanced at him, "If you fall in the manor, it's just a bruised knee, but if you fall here, it won't be just your knee."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked worriedly, "Are you okay, Young Master?"</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped in his tracks, and with a half-smile that was neither a smile nor a frown, he asked him, "If I can't do it, can you?"</p><p>In any case, Jiang Juan felt that he could do better than the Prince. However, realizing that his words earlier might hurt the Prince's pride, Jiang Juan hurriedly said, "Your Highness, you can do it, you're the best."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>He no longer paid attention to Jiang Juan and carried him upstairs.</p><p>But Jiang Juan was still afraid, after all, he was in the Prince's arms. If the Prince couldn't hold on, he would suffer along with him. Jiang Juan said, "Your Highness, let's just stay here, I don't want to go up anymore."</p><p>"I really don't want to go up any further."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and saw Jiang Juan huddled in his arms, almost too scared to look down. He still nodded and put him down.</p><p>They didn't reach the very top but had climbed halfway up. Jiang Juan sat on the stairs rather carelessly and invited Xue Fangli to join him, "Your Highness, sit here."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, lifted his robe, and sat down. Although he was sitting directly on the ground, his posture remained exquisitely elegant.</p><p>At this moment, the evening breeze was gentle, and the night sky was as calm as water.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up at the sky and uncertainly asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, will there really be fireworks?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Yeah."</p><p>His certainty convinced Jiang Juan. He looked left and right, about to say something to Xue Fangli, when a loud boom echoed, and the fireworks soared into the air, slowly blossoming and scattering a carpet of starlight.</p><p>"Boom boom boom—!"</p><p>The fireworks bloomed in clusters after another, filling the sky with a sea of fire trees and shimmering lights.</p><p>Jiang Juan lifted his head and stared for a long time without blinking, suddenly remembering something he had seen before. He took out a scroll from his sleeve.</p><p>"Your Highness, here it is."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked over and was immediately stunned.</p><p>"The painting you asked for this afternoon," Jiang Juan said, "During the waiting time at Baihua Garden, His Majesty asked Yang Liusheng to help repair an old painting. I remembered that you also had a damaged old painting, so I thought he could help you fix it as well. That's why I agreed to let him paint."</p><p>"...But he actually wanted to paint another one and said the previous one was stolen. How could someone steal my portrait?"</p><p>These were the words Lan Ting had just conveyed for Yang Liusheng. Jiang Juan found them strange, but none of that mattered at the moment. Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, quickly open it and see if it's been repaired."</p><p>Xue Fangli made no movement; he simply stared at Jiang Juan.</p><p>In the flickering light of the fireworks, the young man's face alternated between bright and dim. He smiled with his eyebrows curved upward, and his soft lips also curled slightly, his eyes clear and pure.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Your Highness, what is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You..."</p><p>He opened his mouth to say a word, but it came out in a hoarse voice, and he didn't know what else to say.</p><p>The young man had asked for the painting to repair an old one for him.</p><p>Jiang Juan agreed to paint because of that same old painting.</p><p>It was for him, yet also because of him.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan. He recalled many times when he had been tempted and many times when he had restrained himself.</p><p>A single moment of desire had stirred his thoughts.</p><p>If he hadn't indulged in those desires, how could he have lived day after day with constant anxiety, suspicion, and looking over his shoulder?</p><p>If he had not been moved, how would he have wanted the youth to feel pity for him? How could he bear to see the youth too deeply affected and try to make the youth fear him? And what if the youth truly did fear him, unwilling even to bury his head in his arms again?</p><p>He had long harbored such thoughts and been moved.</p><p>Perhaps it was the youth's smile, suggesting that he was good, or perhaps it was the youth sobbing senselessly in his arms while trying to comfort himself, or perhaps it was when he gave him an oracle slip at the Bodhimanda...</p><p>It was his carefulness, his self-restraint, and ultimately—</p><p>he could no longer control his emotions.</p><p>At this moment, the long-suppressed, deepest desires hidden in his heart finally broke through the dam and surged forth.</p><p>He wanted many things, yet he also wanted very little.</p><p>He wanted Jiang Juan to be filled with thoughts of him, for all of her world to belong to him, and he only desired Jiang Juan.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Xue Fangli finally spoke. He looked at Jiang Juan, his expression unreadable, but his voice was soft and gentle.</p><p>"From now on, this king will only care about you. What do you think?"</p>
