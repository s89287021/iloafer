						<p>The two characters "lightly" were faintly brushed, but upon hearing the high official's words, his eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>Did he agree?</p><p>Did His Highness actually agree?</p><p>The wolf pup jumped into the carriage. While the matter wasn't huge, it was also not insignificant. For others, a plea for mercy might lead to leniency with just a few words, but this involved Xue Fangli.</p><p>Their Highness had never been so accommodating before.</p><p>What the high official did not expect was that there was more shocking news to come.</p><p>"This Wang does not spare it now; even if it recovers and is returned to the forest, it will still not survive," Xue Fangli spoke in a slow, measured tone. "This Wang does nothing without meaning."</p><p>Jiang Juan finally relaxed but then tensed up again, "Then..."</p><p>"Bring it back to the palace," Xue Fangli said calmly. "Since this Wang spares its life, it cannot die again."</p><p>With that, Xue Fangli casually ordered, "Gao De, find a veterinarian for it."</p><p>High Official: "?"</p><p>He stood there in shock, momentarily doubting if he was awake. He pinched himself hard, and the pain brought him back to reality with despair. He hurriedly responded, "...Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan froze, his eyes widening in surprise at this unexpected turn of events. He said seriously, "Your Highness, you are really a good person."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him with an ambiguous smile, "Is that so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded without hesitation. Looking back at Xue Fangli, his gaze was clear and pure, filled with trust as if he believed it implicitly.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "You got it wrong."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not explain but simply raised his hand. His distinct knuckles landed on Jiang Juan's face, and she was bewildered, staring at him blankly.</p><p>The blood stain was wiped away, and the youth seemed to ascend instantly, pure like a bodhi tree, untouched by dust.</p><p>Unfortunately, Little Bodhisattva mistakenly took an evil spirit as a good person, just as he—</p><p>A clay bodhisattva crossing a river could not even save itself.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>She was truly beautiful.</p><p>After savoring the memory for a while, the hunter returned to his stall, intending to pack it up and find a place to bury the wolf. However, on his stall, aside from a bloodstain, there was nothing left.</p><p>It was quiet inside the carriage.</p><p>Bloodstains also splattered on the curtains. To avoid getting them on her clothes, Jiang Juan sat further back in the carriage. No matter how spacious the carriage was, the seating was limited, so Jiang Juan leaned close to Xue Fangli.</p><p>"I…"</p><p>Jiang Juan was just about to explain when she looked up and saw Xue Fangli with his eyes closed. Thinking of the weariness in his brows, Jiang Juan held her tongue.</p><p>In fact, as soon as she moved, Xue Fangli noticed, but he was too lazy to open his eyes.</p><p>And as Jiang Juan drew closer, he caught a faint scent again. It seemed like a mixture of various herbs, fresh like grass after the rain, refreshing and invigorating.</p><p>The subtle fragrance had an immense effect.</p><p>The cacophony in his mind, the restlessness from being unable to sleep, all disappeared at this moment. Xue Fangli felt peace he hadn't experienced in a long time; he even, unusually, put down all his guard.</p><p>He allowed the young man to come close, and also allowed him—</p><p>The road was bumpy, and the carriage jolted suddenly. Jiang Juan hesitated for a few seconds before reaching out her hand to let Xue Fangli lean on her so that he wouldn't wake up and could rest a bit longer on the journey.</p><p>After doing this, Jiang Juan glanced at Xue Fangli again. The man's skin was pale, his lips were an intense red. As she looked at him, Jiang Juan couldn't help but reach out to touch his face.</p><p>It felt soft.</p><p>The next second, realizing what she had done, Jiang Juan fell silent.</p><p>He just thought the color looked very nice.</p><p>Was this considered sexual harassment within marriage?</p><p>Jiang Juan guiltily retracted her hand and was immensely relieved that Xue Fangli slept soundly and wasn't woken up. He turned his head to count the jade beads on the curtains. Perhaps because he had been awakened twice last night, he fell asleep while counting.</p><p>In Jiang Juan's steady breathing, Xue Fangli slowly opened his eyes, his fingertips grazing over his lower lip before pausing at a spot.</p><p>It was where Jiang Juan had touched earlier.</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli retracted his hand. He sat up again, but the sleeping youth beside him, lacking support, leaned over onto his shoulder, asleep without any guard.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze and looked at him a few times, but in the end did not push him away. The faint fragrance from his nostrils seemed even clearer. He listened to the sound of the youth's breathing, and soon enough, Xue Fangli began to feel sleepy. This was the first time, without using too much perfume, that Xue Fangli felt drowsy. Just as he was about to close his eyes, the coachman snapped his whip, and someone immediately reported, "Your Highness, we have arrived." "Mm." Xue Fangli massaged his throbbing temples but did not show any intention of getting out of the carriage. The servants in the mansion dared not speak out of turn and could only stand quietly to one side. Instead, the administrator Wang, who had been waiting at the palace gate, walked over and softly asked, "What's going on? Is something wrong?" The servant shook his head without saying anything. Jiang Juan vaguely heard voices outside and slowly woke up. He said dazedly, "Your Highness, have we arrived?" As he spoke, Jiang Juan sat up. Only then did he realize that he had fallen asleep leaning against Xue Fangli's shoulder. Feeling somewhat embarrassed, he said, "The jolts of the carriage made me so sleepy that I dozed off unintentionally. Why didn't you wake me?" "I was just about to wake you," Xue Fangli's expression remained unchanged, "What does your body smell like?" "Not very fragrant, but tolerable." Jiang Juan paused for a moment and raised his hand aimlessly to sniff it, but he couldn't detect anything. He then said uncertainly, "It might be the sachet. Lan Ting gave it to me in the morning, but I didn't like it, so she put it away. It probably has some scent." Xue Fangli nodded and stepped out of the carriage. Jiang Juan followed behind. Since he was still half-asleep, his steps were unsteady. Seeing this, Administrator Wang quickly supported him. Jiang Juan thanked him, "Thank you." Administrator Wang was taken aback but then smiled broadly, saying, "What kind of words are these from a royal concubine? As soon as you stepped out, your servant thought it must be some heavenly beauty descending to earth. It's our servant's good fortune in several lifetimes to have the opportunity to assist you." Jiang Juan: "...". What was with all these people calling him a heavenly beauty and a little Bodhisattva? He, a mere salted fish, did not deserve such praise. "His Majesty sent your servant here early this morning," Administrator Wang said with a grin, "Seeing Your Highness must have made His Majesty very happy."</p><p>Jiang Juan listened carefully and turned to ask Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, what should I do later?"</p><p>He was a bookworm and didn't understand the palace rules very well. Fortunately, Jiang Juan in the book had also never seen much of the world, so he said boldly, "I grew up in the countryside and have never been to the city, so I don’t know many of the rules."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him carelessly and replied, "There are no special rules."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He thought this was unreasonable and wanted to ask more. Then Wang Zongguan spoke up, "Our Emperor doesn't mind such etiquette; Princess Consort need not worry too much about it."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and recollected the plot.</p><p>In the novel, this emperor appeared infrequently, only three times. His first appearance was when Duke Anping requested a matchmaker's gift, his second was at Jiang Nian's wedding with the protagonist, and the third was due to his obsession with longevity techniques, which led to his death.</p><p>He was also just a tool character.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt relieved but then realized he might have forgotten something.</p><p>Before he could think further, they had already arrived at the palace. Wang Zongguan whispered, "Your Majesty, Prince and Princess Consort are here."</p><p>"Finally came."</p><p>The door opened from inside, and a middle-aged man in a dragon robe walked out backwards. He smiled on his face, but with an imperial dignity that resembled that of an ordinary father teasing his long-lost son, "Wang Zongguan, who is this? I seem to recognize him..."</p><p>Wang Zongguan smiled and said, "I also find him familiar, as if... as if..."</p><p>He didn't say who it was. The current emperor—Emperor Hongxing glanced at Xue Fangli, "Since you built your mansion, it's harder for me to see you than to reach the heavens. Today, I owe it all to Third Son."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and said, "Your Majesty, how could there be frequent visits to the palace without important matters?"</p><p>It was just an excuse, Emperor Xinghong knew very well and did not bother to expose it. Instead, he smiled at Jiang Juan and said, "Your name is Jiang Juan, right? Come, let me take a look at you."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded without showing any signs of nervousness. Emperor Xinghong observed him for a moment, becoming increasingly satisfied with what he saw, nodding repeatedly, "A good boy, truly a good boy."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong kindly instructed, "If anything bothers you in the future, come to the palace and seek justice from me. Such a fine child should not suffer any injustice."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, "There’s no need to trouble Your Majesty; Lord Wang can handle it."</p><p>"Oh?" Emperor Xinghong was taken aback but then laughed. He lightly patted Jiang Juan’s shoulder, "That’s right, go find the Fifth Prince. Why should you seek out this old wrecker?"</p><p>"Last night, the Sixth Prince was already given a thorough dressing-down by the Fifth Prince. And those blind dogs, who dared to stir up trouble in front of their master with the heart of a bear and the courage of a leopard."</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Was he beaten by Lord Wang?</p><p>Jiang Juan widened his eyes to look at Xue Fangli, feeling a mix of joy and worry.</p><p>No matter how foolish the Sixth Prince was, he was still one of the main characters.</p><p>Was it fine for him to be punished?</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze and said coolly, "He should learn some sense."</p><p>"The Sixth Prince is indeed an incompetent fellow who needs to be taught a lesson," Emperor Xinghong waved dismissively, then remembering something, added, "As for your brother, you should at least give him some face and not make him lose all dignity."</p><p>"At the banquet last time, you two…"</p><p>Just as he spoke, someone reported from outside the hall, "Your Majesty, Marquis of Anping requests an audience."</p><p>The hall fell silent momentarily, with many pairs of eyes, overt or covert, focusing on Jiang Juan and assessing his expression. Even Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Duke of Ping'an?</p><p>Why does this name sound familiar?</p><p>Jiang Juan was momentarily taken aback, thinking for a while before an epiphany struck her.</p><p>Isn't this my ex-fiancé?</p><p>No, he should be my former fiancé.</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Jiang Juan remembered something she had forgotten.</p><p>According to the original story, two days after being sent to Li Wang Fu—on the same day as Jiang Juan's suicide attempt—Duke of Ping'an entered the palace to request that the current emperor grant him permission to marry the main character, who was awarded by Jiang Nian.</p><p>It seemed they had crossed paths.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>She remembered that her namesake cannon fodder had really loved Duke of Ping'an.</p><p>Jiang Juan's scalp tingled as she reminisced about the plot.</p><p>According to the story, the engagement between Duke of Ping'an and Jiang Juan was no secret in the capital; moreover, after Jiang Juan arrived in the capital, wherever Duke of Ping'an went, there he would be, almost obsessively following him around.</p><p>Young masters and misses from prominent families naturally wouldn't act like her—they valued their reputations and those of their families. As such, Jiang Juan became a unique eccentric.</p><p>It was even considered good that she only clung to people.</p><p>Duke Ping's Marquis hailed from an illustrious background, was handsomely handsome, and had many admirers. Jiang Juan felt insignificant among them. In terms of family lineage, talent, and appearance, he lacked any advantage; his only asset was a marriage contract.</p><p>Jiang Juan had already been uneasy, but then discovered that Duke Ping's Marquis' attitude towards Jiang Nian was extraordinary. He found this unsettling and inquired about the marriage contract, to which the marquis merely responded with inconvenience, repeatedly postponing the wedding date.</p><p>Later on, he sensed that the duke intended to break off the engagement. Driven by desperation, Jiang Juan first drugged him, then took advantage of his stay at the Secretary's Residence to climb into bed with him, but each attempt was discovered.</p><p>Several forced marriages left the Secretary's Residence in disarray and fueled Duke Ping's Marquis' displeasure.</p><p>Not to mention that he had even pushed his brother Jiang Nian into a lake for Duke Ping's Marquis.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He could not understand it but was profoundly shaken.</p><p>Was this love?</p><p>What Jiang Juan was thinking, others of course did not know, but his infatuation with Duke Ping's Marquis was somewhat heard of by Emperor Hongxing. The emperor feared that their meeting would cause a scene.</p><p>After much contemplation, Emperor Hongxing asked Jiang Juan, "Good child, tell me, should I see him or not?"</p><p>Wang Zongguan, upon hearing this, could not help but sweat for Jiang Juan.</p><p>If they did not meet, Third Young Master would likely feel guilty and how could the Prince accommodate him?</p><p>If they met and he exhibited his infatuation again, the prince would still not tolerate it.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan was not particularly eager to meet him.</p><p>He merely wanted to live a life of ease, contentedly being a 'dead fish,' without getting close to the main cast, as that would surely bring misfortune.</p><p>But now he did not want to affect the plot.</p><p>Jiang Juan said with a calm face, "Of course I will. Perhaps Lord Anping has something urgent to discuss."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, and Jiang Juan looked back with an innocent gaze. Xue Fangli's lips curled slightly.</p><p>How could he forget that Third Young Master was already taken?</p><p>In his eyes, the Prince was a good man, but what about Lord Anping?</p><p>The Sage?</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled carelessly, but his expression turned icy cold.</p><p>Not long after, Manager Wang shouted hoarsely, "Announcing—Lord Anping enters!"</p>
