						<p>After watching the fireworks, it was time to return to the Wangfu.</p><p>The carriage jolted along, and Jiang Juan, who had not been particularly tired before, found himself falling asleep due to the constant motion. He leaned against Xue Fangli's shoulder, drifting off into a drowsy state again.</p><p>"Why can't you sleep enough?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a moment, then smiled faintly. Jiang Juan, seemingly unaware, continued to sleep soundly. Indeed, he was a very heavy sleeper; in the past, his cousin often teased him, saying that while he could charge for eight hours, he only had six hours of standby.</p><p>Upon reaching the Wangfu, Xue Fangli did not wake him up but instead carried him off the carriage. However, after taking just a few steps, Jiang Juan woke up. He looked around and pointed in another direction, "Your Highness, my courtyard is that way."</p><p>Xue Fangli's steps paused, "Not sleeping with this Wang?"</p><p>Jiang Juan honestly replied, "I can sleep by myself as well."</p><p>Sleeping with the Prince would be comfortable, as he could snuggle against him. However, Xue Fangli held him too tightly; he could not turn over freely and had to maintain the same position for a long time, which was uncomfortable.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him; his youthful eyes were clear and unblemished, without a trace of impurity, or even...</p><p>Desire.</p><p>He knew nothing about love yet.</p><p>His willingness to let Jiang Juan care for him and to care for him more was out of compassion and sympathy, not affection.</p><p>This realization suddenly halted Xue Fangli's steps.</p><p>Compassion and sympathy were already enough, but now he wanted more.</p><p>He wanted everything with Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze, his expression solemn, but his words were gentle, as if filled with endless patience, "Didn't you promise this Wang that from now on, he would only care for you?"</p><p>"Go to sleep yourself. What if you suddenly fall ill?"</p><p>Jiang Juan subconsciously replied, "Isn't there Lan Ting?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, but his displeasure did not show at all. He only said gently, "You have a maid sleeping in the side room, yet this prince does not like anyone serving beside me. If you do not sleep with this prince and I cough up blood again, what will happen then?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was caught off guard. Last time at the villa, when wolves came, no one noticed. If the Prince went to sleep himself, they probably wouldn't know if he coughed up blood.</p><p>After a few seconds of thought, Jiang Juan still agreed, "Alright, I'll sleep there with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed in agreement. His red lips gently lifted, and he carried Jiang Juan step by step into the Cool Wind Yard.</p><p>He was not patient, but when it came to Jiang Juan, he had a bit more patience.</p><p>If she didn't know love, so be it.</p><p>He would still drag her into the maelstrom of the world.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Xue Congjun arrived at Prince Fangli's mansion early in the morning.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Jiang Juan should still be sleeping. He couldn't see anyone, but today not only did Prince Fangli wake up early, he also had Lan Ting wake Jiang Juan up and have breakfast with him. Jiang Juan said painfully, "I don't want to eat, I'll talk about it after I wake up."</p><p>Lan Ting smiled and said, "The Prince asked Young Master to eat before sleeping."</p><p>Jiang Juan grumbled, "But if I eat, my drowsiness will be gone."</p><p>Lan Ting calmly replied, "Young Master loves sleep so much. Missing a little bit won't matter, and you'll fall asleep on the bed as soon as you lie down."</p><p>She made sense, so Jiang Juan got up, was tidied up, and then a high-ranking official led Xue Congjun in. "Princess Consort, look who's here."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up indifferently and asked Xue Congjun, "Why are you here?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "Why can't I be here?"</p><p>He walked over confidently, sat opposite Jiang Juan, then deliberately picked up a piece of pastry. Just as he was about to put it in his mouth, he saw something and hesitated before asking, "What's wrong with your hand?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down. Last time, when he had taken the incense, he had scalded his hands, which were still not fully healed, so several fingers were still bandaged. Jiang Juan said grumpily, "I accidentally got scalded."</p><p>How did that happen? It was pretty embarrassing to talk about, and Jiang Juan didn't want to elaborate. Moreover, he hadn't slept well the previous night, looking rather drowsy. Xue Congjun, noticing this, thought that during this period, Jiang Juan had been bullied by his fifth brother again and was feeling low, so he couldn't help but lower his voice and sighed, "My fifth brother is really not a human being."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>He raised his head in confusion, wondering why the prince suddenly got scolded. Before he could ask, Xue Congjun remembered something and quickly took out a small object from his pocket.</p><p>"Look at this."</p><p>Jiang Juan's attention was immediately drawn away. He curiously asked, "What is this?"</p><p>Xue Congjun replied, "A heart-shaped ball. Have you seen it before?"</p><p>He placed the heart-shaped ball in his hand. The material seemed to be carved ivory, with intricate patterns on the outermost layer of the ivory sphere, and several smaller ivory spheres nested inside, all hollowed out. A golden hairpin was inserted into it, making it both exquisite and beautiful.</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to shake his head honestly and say he hadn't seen it before, but remembering that he had just called the prince not a human being, he changed his mind and said, "I've seen it, many times. I use these heart-shaped balls to skip stones on water."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "?"</p><p>His notorious competitive spirit flared up again, and Xue Congjun almost choked in anger, "You're lying! How could you have seen it many times and even use it for skipping stones?!"</p><p>Xue Congjun couldn't take provocation. He roared right back, "It's called a heart-shaped ball, also known as a ghost work ball, named after the phrase 'a work of divine craftsmanship.' Look at its carvings; each layer has different patterns, with a consistent theme but no monotonous content, and they are indeed united in their hearts—"</p><p>Xue Congjun removed the golden hairpin, and the four ivory spheres nested inside immediately started rotating.</p><p>"Isn't it exquisite?"</p><p>Xue Congyun was quite proud of himself, but this pride lasted for less than a second before he angrily asked Jiang Juan, "Only my mother has a set of these heart-synchronized spheres. Where did you see them so many times and even use them to skip stones?"</p><p>Jiang Juan showed no signs of shame as she slowly replied, "I really saw them, in my dreams."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>Damn it, he had been fooled again.</p><p>Realizing this belatedly, Xue Congyun felt rather dejected. Every time he met Jiang Juan, he would end up feeling embarrassed a few times.</p><p>However, since Jiang Juan claimed to have seen them in her dream, she hadn't actually seen the heart-synchronized spheres, which made Xue Congyun feel slightly pleased—his desire for victory was greatly satisfied.</p><p>Looking at Jiang Juan's hands, Xue Congyun felt somewhat sorry for her and decided not to hold a grudge. He immediately waved his hand and said, "I'll give it to you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, "What? Why are you giving it to me?"</p><p>Xue Congyun looked complex as he replied, "Of course...for you..."</p><p>It was too tragic.</p><p>Married to his fifth brother, she suffered day and night. It was truly too tragic.</p><p>How could one relieve their worries? Only with treasures.</p><p>The moment Xue Congyun saw this set of heart-synchronized spheres at his mother's place, he decided to take it over and give it to Jiang Juan to play with.</p><p>Of course, the main reason was to pay a visit and comfort her, so that she wouldn't lose hope under his fifth brother's torment.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Congyun said sympathetically, "You've been through too much. In the future, whenever I have any treasures, I'll send one over for you to play with. Don't think too much about it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>"Huh? What can't you get over?"</p><p>As a piece of salted fish, how could Jiang Juan possibly participate in outdoor activities voluntarily? He refused outright, "No, I won't go."</p><p>Xue Congyun tried persuading him, "What's the point of being alone at the mansion? Why don't you come out and play with me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "How can it be uninteresting staying at the mansion? I can sleep when I want to and eat whenever I feel like it. There's nothing uninteresting about it."</p><p>Xue Congyun said, "But you'll be alone. Let me tell you, there are students from the Rate of Reason Hall and the Broad Industry Hall in the national university participating today. It's going to be very lively."</p><p>With so many people around, Jiang Juan did not want to go even more. He shook his head repeatedly, "I won't go. I still want to sleep after I finish my meal."</p><p>Why does he still want to sleep? Xue Congyun asked him, "Didn't you rest last night?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was also concerned about saving face. After thinking for a moment, he told Xue Congyun, "Yeah, I didn't sleep much last night."</p><p>Xue Congyun finally stopped pestering him, "Alright then, go to sleep."</p><p>After saying that, Xue Congyun put the pastry he had just made into his mouth and said indistinctly, "I was even telling Gu Puwang that I would bring you along to play last night. But you didn't go."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Gu Puwang?</p><p>And he didn't agree.</p><p>Gu Puwang is also one of the main characters. Unlike the idle Prince Liuyi and Jiang Qingliang, Gu Puwang is a capable person. Together with Duke Pingan in the capital, they are known as "the Capital Jade Pendants."</p><p>He was precocious in his youth, a child prodigy when young, and became an erudite man as he grew up. He mastered the Six Arts but had a solitary personality, hence seldom socializing with the protagonist. Later, however, he gradually befriended the Sixth Prince and Jiang Qingliang.</p><p>Jiang Juan was already forced to interact with the Sixth Prince and Jiang Qingliang and really did not want to deal with the protagonist again.</p><p>He might as well go to sleep.</p><p>Unable to lure Jiang Juan away, Xue Congjun went off to play on his own, eating a few pastries left by Jiang Juan. Then he swaggered off, leaving Jiang Juan to fiddle with the heart-shaped pendant he had left behind. After having eaten his fill and played enough, Jiang Juan reclined back on the bed, intending to take another nap—</p><p>Strange.</p><p>Before he could lie down, Xue Fangli returned. He said to Jiang Juan, "This Wang needs to go out for a while. Since you are not asleep yet, come with me."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Why did he always have to be dragged out? Jiang Juan shook his head vehemently, "I don't want to go; I want to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and said in a leisurely tone, "In the palace, you told this Wang that your heart ailment requires some walking. Today, I will take you for a stroll."</p><p>Things were different now. Jiang Juan earnestly replied, "The person who wanted to walk was my past self; my present self does not wish to move at all. I won't go for a stroll, Your Highness. You go by yourself."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows slightly, "Not willing to move?"</p><p>He approached Jiang Juan and bent down, lifting Jiang Juan from the bedside, "You don't need to move; this Wang will do it for you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>What was with taking him for a stroll? The Prince just wanted a human pillow.</p><p>Afraid of falling, Jiang Juan only hugged his neck and asked in a mournful tone, "Your Highness, do you remember that you promised me you wouldn't pick me up out of nowhere anymore?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with an ambiguous smile, "Do you want to walk by yourself?"</p><p>Jiang Juan fell silent for a few seconds, then hugged him even tighter and immediately made his choice.</p><p>—Don’t think you can trick me into taking another step.</p><p>Originally, he could have gone along with it, but since the Prince had insisted on pulling him out, he would be responsible. Next time, he definitely wouldn’t let the Prince carry him away again.</p><p>The carriage left the capital city.</p><p>Throughout the journey, Jiang Juan performed his role as a pillow, sitting in Xue Fangli’s arms for the entire trip. However, upon arriving at their destination, he lifted the curtain and found himself reluctant to get out of the carriage.</p><p>"Prince, what are you going to do?"</p><p>In the outskirts of the capital, with fields stretching far and water flowing gently, it was an ideal place for outdoor activities. Jiang Juan asked in surprise, "You wouldn’t really be taking me for a walk, would you?"</p><p>As for bringing Jiang Juan along, it was initially just to tease him. But after hugging him tightly, Jiang Juan himself wrapped his arms around Xue Fangli, and Xue Fangli thought there was no harm in including him, so he brought him out as well.</p><p>These details didn’t need to be explained to Jiang Juan. With a smile, Xue Fangli asked, "If you want to take a walk, I’ll accompany you after I’m done with some matters."</p><p>Jiang Juan certainly did not want to, quickly shaking his head, "No, I don’t want to at all."</p><p>Feeling afraid of being tricked into walking, Jiang Juan’s fair fingers clutched the soft cushion, refusing to get out of the carriage. Xue Fangli didn’t insist either but simply said, "Wait here for this Prince to return."</p><p>As long as he wasn’t flipped over, anything was fine with Jiang Juan, who immediately agreed, "Alright."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and left a few guards behind.</p><p>In the end, Jiang Juan still didn’t know why they had gone out, but he didn’t dwell on it. With the Prince absent, he lay back lazily in the carriage, then flopped down bonelessly, changing positions several times before falling asleep again.</p><p>After sleeping through several naps, when Jiang Juan woke up again, the Prince was still not back.</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered as she lifted the curtain and looked around, only to find that the Prince was nowhere to be seen. Instead, she discovered someone sitting calmly on the shore, fishing intently.</p><p>The spring sunshine was warm, but the spot where the man sat faced directly towards the sun, causing him to seem almost blinded by the glare. However, he made no indication of moving to a different position to fish.</p><p>It seemed that the man knew someone was in the carriage; he heard her voice without surprise and did not even turn his head. He simply replied slowly, "No."</p><p>Jiang Juan then curiously questioned him, "What's so enjoyable about fishing?"</p><p>Ripples spread on the water, and the hook rose and fell unpredictably, suggesting that a fish might be hooked. However, the man did not retrieve it. Jiang Juan reminded him, "It looks like you've caught a fish."</p><p>The man replied with a "Hmm," but made no move to act. Once the water calmed down, he answered Jiang Juan's previous question calmly, "Fishing is relaxing and allows one to clear their mind."</p><p>Jiang Juan pondered for a moment before posing what felt like a soul-searching question, "Then why don't you sleep more?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>The man hesitated briefly before slowly turning his head.</p><p>Silence, long silence.</p><p>Jiang Juan apologized, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Continue fishing."</p><p>However, the man responded, "I think what you said makes a lot of sense."</p><p>With that, he continued calmly, "But I have to get up every day before dawn."</p><p>Getting up so early was too brutal, Jiang Juan asked him, "Why do you wake up so early? Why not sleep a little longer?"</p><p>The man studied her for a moment and then asked her, "Don't you know me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head, "I don't recognize you."</p><p>Gu Puwang nodded in agreement. He gave Jiang Juan a rather cold smile and slowly replied, "I was actually asleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Gu Puwang asked, "Were you also sleeping just now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. The two of them looked at each other, sensing the same kindred spirit in one another. If one had to describe their current situation with a single word, it would probably be:</p><p>—Misery loves company.</p>
