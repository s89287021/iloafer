						<p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He wasn't the fastest runner, but if he had known there were wolves, he would have been.</p><p>Facts proved that curiosity could not only kill a cat but also a salted fish.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never experienced such a grand scene; the pairs of green eyes made him feel uneasy and all he wanted was to escape through the door.</p><p>Of course, he didn't manage to do so; he was purely scared out of his wits.</p><p>Just as he was floundering, footsteps grew closer, and the guards also arrived. "Lady Wang, you can't——"</p><p>Before they could finish their sentence, the guards saw the pack of wolves and were immediately terrified!</p><p>Where did these wolves come from?</p><p>Even if the Prince didn't often visit the villa, he would conduct routine patrols throughout the mountain every day. They had not discovered any abnormalities today, nor had there been any signs of wild animals.</p><p>"Protect the Prince!"</p><p>At the chief guard's command, everyone quickly drew their swords and entered, breaking the standoff at that moment. The pack of wolves no longer waited to be slaughtered but suddenly pounced on one person!</p><p>With a "clang," the guard swung his sword, narrowly dodging the wolf's attack while also shattering a jade lamp. They held their swords up and faced the pack of wolves head-on.</p><p>The night wind rose again, and the light silk curtains swayed at the viewing platform, with chimes jingling. Jiang Juan suddenly noticed a wolf hiding in the shadows, about to launch a surprise attack on Xue Fangli. Instinctively, he took a few steps forward, "Prince——"</p><p>His foot stepped on something that pierced through his flesh. Jiang Juan gasped and gritted his teeth, saying, "... behind."</p><p>The wolves fiercely attacked Xue Fangli, who seemed to have anticipated it and dodged them. A few more wolves slowly emerged from the viewing platform, surrounding them. Wolves were all around them, front and back.</p><p>"Prince, we'll protect you; hurry——"</p><p>"Kill the wolf king first."</p><p>Xue Fangli said calmly, then he turned to strike with a sword. The wolf that had attacked him took a few steps back, seemingly enraged. It let out several low growls, and all the wolves launched an attack!</p><p>Just as time seemed to stand still, a faint, weak voice sounded, like a small animal sobbing.</p><p>The wolf cub that had been hiding somewhere emerged with another large wolf biting its neck.</p><p>Its sobbing did not seem meaningless but rather a way of communicating with the wolf pack. Soon enough, the wolves abandoned their attack, though they remained cautious.</p><p>One by one, they departed until only the wolf king and the large wolf carrying the young wolf were left. They gave Jiang Juan a deep look before leaping off the viewing platform into the darkness.</p><p>The intense battle was thus defused.</p><p>Jiang Juan was bewildered.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Jiang Juan found it strange but could not think further about it, for he had been too tense earlier. Now that he relaxed, his feet felt an excruciating pain.</p><p>Jiang Juan could no longer bear it. He sat down on the ground, lowering his head to look but dared not do so. Xue Fangli looked over and said, "What——"</p><p>He paused mid-sentence.</p><p>The youth sat on the ground with lowered lashes. His green shirt clung to him, still damp from water marks. His long hair was scattered, still dripping in streaks.</p><p>And beneath the shirt were delicate, fair ankles. He went barefoot; his feet were beautiful in shape with rounded toes. They should have been a sight to behold but were now spotted with blood.</p><p>"It hurts."</p><p>Jiang Juan lifted his head. His face and eyes were wet, and his nose was slightly red, as if he were shrouded in steam, soaked and pitiful.</p><p>Jiang Juan had always been afraid of pain and could not endure it either. He did not listen carefully but merely whispered, "Prince, I hurt so much."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at him. Soon after, his elaborate robe fell over Jiang Juan, covering him completely. Xue Fangli bent down to pick up Jiang Juan and laid him on the bed.</p><p>Without turning around, he coldly said, "Don't you go check what happened? Do you want this prince to deal with you right now?"</p><p>The guards' faces turned pale upon hearing this. Wolves were cunning by nature and could read human emotions well; being targeted by a pack of wolves made one helpless. However, regardless of the situation, it was their failure to notice in time that led them here, so they had no choice but to redeem themselves through their service.</p><p>They left on command, and Xue Fangli added, "Call Doctor Sun over."</p><p>As people gradually departed, Jiang Juan remained hidden under the robe. He originally just felt pain, but as he endured it, homesickness began to gnaw at him. Tears silently rolled down his cheeks, soaking into the robe and wetting a small patch.</p><p>He cried silently without making a sound and stopped shouting in pain. His fingers furrowed the robe, and Xue Fangli seemed to notice or did not, as he casually lit the candle.</p><p>"Why did you come?"</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli suddenly spoke up. He raised his hand to lift one corner of the robe, and Jiang Juan looked at him with tears in his eyes. Then his chin was gently pinched, lifted again, and Xue Fangli said, "You really cried your heart out."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt embarrassed and turned his head away. However, Xue Fangli tightened his grip, not letting him escape. After observing for a moment, he said, "You feel wronged."</p><p>"What am I wronged about?" Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. "It was you who left the courtyard and you who barged in. If you had stayed obediently in the courtyard or left on your own tonight, how would you have gotten injured?"</p><p>Jiang Juan naturally felt wronged; he missed his ibuprofen, but this era did not have it, so he could only endure the pain.</p><p>Moreover—</p><p>"I didn't originally plan to come in. I was also worried that you might fall ill, as you seemed off in the morning."</p><p>Jiang Juan's voice was muffled and tinged with a nasal tone. He looked up at Xue Fangli, his eyelashes drenched.</p><p>Xue Fangli froze.</p><p>"I'm afraid you fainted," Jiang Juan added.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Why?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied quickly, "You are kind to me and everyone else."</p><p>In the novel, King Li died of a sudden illness. Jiang Juan could not help King Li, but he could offer some end-of-life care. If the Prince really fell ill, discovering it early might help him find ways to alleviate his suffering sooner.</p><p>What an interesting situation.</p><p>He thought.</p><p>— With eyelashes hanging down, tears silently fell, like a mud Bodhisattva in distress, tossed into the sea of suffering, pitiful yet pathetic.</p><p>Why was he crying so bitterly?</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>Xue Fangli paused his movements and retracted his hand expressionlessly.</p><p>It is said that when wolves came to Zhuangzi's residence, all high-ranking officials were terrified. The moment Xue Fangli arrived with Sun Taiyi, they knelt at his feet and wept profusely, "Your Highness, you have frightened us to death!"</p><p>This time, the Prince truly came too perilously! </p><p>First, he arrived at the manor. The Prince had a heavy guard against betrayal and used incense, never allowing anyone to serve as his bodyguard, especially when he planned to rest, for fear that excessive use of incense would cause him to fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>Then there were those wolves. The manor was situated on a mountain, with patrols carried out every day without fail; there had never been any traces of wild beasts before. Yet, they appeared tonight.</p><p>Wolves are known for their cunning and deceit. Perhaps they had hidden for a long time and seized the opportunity to attack when the guards were unprepared, or perhaps they had come from deep in the mountains, but ultimately, they headed straight for the Prince.</p><p>"What despicable method — I wonder which damned person—"</p><p>He cursed halfway before Governor Affairs shut his mouth, knowing that there were only a few people who dared oppose their Prince, and all of them were nobles whom he couldn’t just point fingers at.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, understanding what he was thinking, and said coolly, "It wasn't them."</p><p>His elder brother and that woman didn’t have such brains.</p><p>—Besides knowing everything about his habits, this person seemed to know quite a bit more.</p><p>From the moment the wolves withdrew, Xue Fangli had confirmed that there was something wrong with the deer antler blood wine. He never ate outside, whether it was blood wine or not; if the wine made him uneasy, he would spill it over.</p><p>However, someone had replaced the deer antler blood wine with wolf blood wine, prompting the wolves to come for revenge on another manor.</p><p>One step led to another, each move crucial and irrevocable. Every action was a high-stakes gamble.</p><p>Yet, surprisingly, there were still surviving young wolves, and the youth insisted on saving them.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled coldly, his expression chilling to the bone, "There are some things even His Majesty the Emperor doesn't know; I, however, wish to know how he found out."</p><p>Governor Affairs didn’t dare respond but was inwardly relieved.</p><p>Regardless of what happened, the Prince was safe. This time had been extremely perilous.</p><p>If the Prince had rested, if Third Young Master had not saved that wolf cub, and had not arrived in time, the Prince would have been dead! Thinking of this, High Eunuch Affairs could not help but mutter to himself, "Thanks to Third Young Master..."</p><p>Third Young Master showed sympathy for the wolf cub, and as a result, through some misadventure, he ended up saving the Prince's life by accident!</p><p>Xue Fangli heard this and raised his eyes. Doctor Sun was treating Jiang Juan's wound, his foot stepping on broken pieces of crystal lamps that needed to be removed one by one.</p><p>The young man wore black gold robes, sitting on a maiden bed with his injured foot propped up on soft cushions. Doctor Sun was removing the fragments, but before he could exert much force, Jiang Juan already winced and tried to pull back.</p><p>Doctor Sun could only console him, "Hold it in for a moment, it will be over soon."</p><p>Jiang Juan regretted running barefoot, but no matter how much he regretted it, he still had to endure the pain. Jiang Juan slowly extended his foot, and Doctor Sun continued with the treatment.</p><p>The fragments were not large, but they were all embedded in the flesh. Jiang Juan gave himself some encouragement in his mind; it was just removing fragments, he could do it, there was no problem—</p><p>No, it still hurt so much, he couldn't endure it.</p><p>Jiang Juan retracted again. This time, regardless of Doctor Sun's persuasion, he kept shaking his head. Doctor Sun had to seek help from Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, the object on Your Consort's foot needs to be removed as soon as possible."</p><p>Xue Fangli naturally saw how much Jiang Juan resisted and asked him, "Do you want to endure it yourself or have someone pin you down?"</p><p>"Can I choose neither option?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked dejectedly, already afraid of the pain. Xue Fangli did not respond but approached a few steps closer, bending down to grasp his ankle.</p><p>The feeling was strange, and Jiang Juan instinctively struggled, causing his robes to slip off and lifting his own sleeves as well. The delicate white ankles were revealed above, followed by two bare legs.</p><p>Fair-skinned with balanced muscles, beautiful even the kneecaps were faintly pink.</p><p>Xue Fangli tightened his grip on Jiang Juan's ankle, staring at him without speaking. However, Jiang Juan was still moving around unconsciously. He changed his mind and said, "I will do it myself; I think I can endure it."</p><p>If the Prince had rested, if Third Young Master had not saved that wolf cub, and had not arrived in time, the Prince would have been dead! Thinking of this, High Eunuch Affairs could not help but mutter to himself, "Thanks to Third Young Master..."</p><p>Third Young Master showed sympathy for the wolf cub, and as a result, through some misadventure, he ended up saving the Prince's life by accident!</p><p>Xue Fangli heard this and raised his eyes.

He slowly extended his foot, and Doctor Sun continued with the treatment.</p><p>The fragments were not large, but they were deeply embedded in the flesh. Jiang Juan gave himself some encouragement; it was just removing fragments, he could do it—</p><p>But the pain was too much to bear.</p><p>Jiang Juan retracted again. This time, regardless of Doctor Sun's persuasion, he kept shaking his head. Doctor Sun had to seek help from Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, the object on Your Consort's foot needs to be removed as soon as possible."</p><p>Xue Fangli naturally saw how much Jiang Juan resisted and asked him, "Do you want to endure it yourself or have someone pin you down?"</p><p>"Can I choose neither option?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked dejectedly; he was already afraid of the pain.

However, Jiang Juan was still moving around unconsciously. He changed his mind and said, "I will do it myself; I think I can endure it."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not let go.</p><p>The sensation in his hand was soft, the teenager's ankle so thin that it could barely be grasped. When he grabbed it, his thumb landed below the calf, causing a slight indentation on the snow-white skin.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan saw him ignoring her and called out curiously, her gaze as pure as ever.</p><p>The fingers, with their clear joints, released for an instant before meeting his eyes again, only to grip firmly once more. He lowered his eyelids and said, "You can't endure it."</p><p>Alright, he'll just hold on then, Jiang Juan thought to herself: "... Alright."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "Put your clothes back on."</p><p>Jiang Juan casually pulled up the coat that did not belong to her, while Xue Fangli sat beside her, placing her feet, which had been resting on a cushion, on his lap. He then glanced at Doctor Sun and gestured for him to begin.</p><p>Seeing this, Doctor Sun opened his eyes wide in disbelief; he hadn't expected Xue Fangli to personally intervene. However, he didn't linger on it for long, as time was of the essence.</p><p>This will definitely work.</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart pounded as she lowered her head, only to reflexively want to dodge when Doctor Sun made no move. Her ankle was held too tightly, making any movement impossible.</p><p>"Don't look if you're scared," Xue Fangli said.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't want to see either, but she couldn't help herself; it felt more secure to watch. As she thought this, Doctor Sun took the opportunity to extract a fragment.</p><p>The pain caused Jiang Juan's eyelashes to twitch, but Doctor Sun gave her no time to react, swiftly removing more fragments one after another.</p><p>It hurts so much, really hurts.</p><p>Tears welled up in Jiang Juan's eyes. She dared not blink and found it extremely hard to hold them back. Suddenly, a hand pressed on the back of her neck and pulled her head in one direction, causing her forehead to rest against something.</p><p>He leaned against Xue Fangli's shoulder.</p><p>Jiang Juan finally dared to blink, and the tears frozen on his eyelashes fell. He inhaled lightly, gripping Xue Fangli's sleeve without letting go.</p><p>Though the boy was so afraid of pain, he wasn't afraid of him.</p><p>If he wanted to, he had a hundred ways to make the boy feel more pain, until he cried but couldn't cry anymore.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan for a long time, then leaned close to his ear and spoke in an extremely slow tone, "Do you know that this king has drunk human blood and eaten human flesh?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was in such pain that his consciousness became hazy. He knew Xue Fangli was talking to him, but he couldn't think or understand the specific meaning of those words.</p><p>He didn't react.</p><p>Xue Fangli parted his lips slightly and smiled slowly, but there was no warmth in his eyes.</p><p>Hearing it, but pretending not to hear?</p><p>Or still not afraid, but unwilling to deal with him anymore?</p><p>Sure enough, Little Bodhisattva was just Little Bodhisattva, kind-hearted and unable to bear even a trace of filth.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Jiang Juan suddenly spoke up. He barely managed to muster some energy and muttered, "No wonder the Young Master seemed off when he saw that bowl of wine this morning, you must have been scared too."</p><p>"Forget it, you definitely didn't want to think about it. I won't ask anymore."</p><p>His voice was very soft, with a hint of tremor at the end, but he still tried to comfort Xue Fangli, "It's okay, it's all over now, don't think about it anymore."</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyelid flickered open. He didn't speak but stared intently at Jiang Juan, and that mad idea rose again.</p><p>Unable to restrain himself.</p><p>How dare he console him?</p><p>How dare he not fear him?</p><p>He originally intended to let him go, allowing him to continue being the little bodhisattva on the lotus platform. He wanted to save all beings and help those in distress, but this little bodhisattva repeatedly, unconsciously provoked him.</p><p>So he will stay by his side.</p><p>He is an evil spirit in the Avici Hell; he can either redeem him or go to hell together.</p>
