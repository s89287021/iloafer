						<p>Xue Fangli: "……"</p><p>Taking the medicine was not a problem, but seeing Jiang Juan's eyelashes all wet made Xue Fangli pause for a moment, feeling quite annoyed.</p><p>He enjoyed making Jiang Juan cry, but he didn't want to do it this way.</p><p>Xue Fangli had no intention of taking the medicine. Jiang Juan looked at him and got a bit confused.</p><p>Thinking from his own perspective, Jiang Juan thought that Xue Fangli also disliked the taste because she was afraid of bitterness when she took the medicine. However, he still needed to take it. After thinking for a moment, Jiang Juan drank a mouthful by herself.</p><p>But before he could get close, a hand reached out and grabbed Jiang Juan's face, "Spit it out."</p><p>Jiang Juan scrunched up his forehead in bitterness but shook his head. He wanted to push Xue Fangli's hand away, but this hand squeezed even harder. Xue Fangli said, "Hurry up."</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable under the pressure, Jiang Juan had no choice but to lower his head and spit it out, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was unpleasant, "Did you take the medicine randomly?"</p><p>"What random? I didn't drink it. I had to feed it to you myself. Who wants to drink your medicine."</p><p>Feeding him with good intentions, he got scolded instead, and Jiang Juan couldn't bear this injustice. With a bang, he placed the bowl of medicine on the table. Not only did he refuse to feed it orally, he didn't even want to do it himself now, "Drink it yourself."</p><p>His mouth was very bitter, and Jiang Juan just wanted to eat something to suppress the taste, but he was afraid that Xue Fangli wouldn't take his medicine properly. He could only temporarily hold it in and looked at him unhappily.</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli sighed lightly, "Usually, when I make you take your medicine, you won't drink even if I coax you for half a day. Today, not being your own medicine, but still insist on feeding it into your mouth, huh? Don't you fear bitterness anymore?"</p><p>How could he not be afraid of bitterness? Jiang Juan turned his head and didn't want to reason with him. Xue Fangli then tilted his head and stared at Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Get away," Jiang Juan muttered unhappily, "Seeing you is troublesome."</p><p>Knowing what was bothering him, Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "Just for not letting you take your medicine, it's worth getting angry over?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "It's worth it. You've also fed me like this before, so why can't I?"</p><p>"No reason."</p><p>Jiang Juan opened her eyes wide at him, not expecting someone to be so unreasonable.</p><p>"You are pampered and afraid of both pain and hardship," Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "I didn't want you to taste any bitterness."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned for a moment. Xue Fangli then raised his hand, picked up a piece of honey candy from the fruit platter, and fed it to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan instinctively opened her mouth, took in the honey candy, and the sweet taste like honey melted in her mouth, suppressing that sour and bitter taste of medicine.</p><p>"Is it sweet?"</p><p>"...Mm-hmm."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "This is what you should eat."</p><p>Jiang Juan was originally chewing on the honey candy, but she froze upon hearing this.</p><p>Since he refused to feed her anymore, that bowl of medicine naturally had to be consumed by Xue Fangli himself. However, since he wasn't Jiang Juan, drinking medicine wasn't a difficult task for him, so he drank it down without changing his expression.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>The honey candy was very sweet, but Jiang Juan felt sour inside. She looked at Xue Fangli for quite some time before she finally wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned towards him.</p><p>"Kiss me."</p><p>Jiang Juan initiated a kiss from him.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes but did not make any move. Jiang Juan knew he was afraid of making himself feel pain, so she said again, "You said you wanted me to feel more pain, I want to hurt you too, but you refuse. How can your words and actions be so inconsistent?"</p><p>"I am afraid of hardship, but..."</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "I can endure some hardships. I can share your hardships with you, or bear your burdens, as long as you comfort me a little."</p><p>"You know how worthless I am. Just give me a kiss and I'll listen to you."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan fluttered his eyelashes and stared at Xue Fangli intently. His gaze was pure, without any reservation, filled with sincerity.</p><p>"I also want to take care of you."</p><p>Jiang Juan added this sentence.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a few seconds, then raised his red lips slightly. He lowered his head as if he wanted to kiss Jiang Juan, but stopped halfway. They were very close, their breaths mingling.</p><p>"Can you bear my hardships?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was slow. "There aren't many hardships I can give you, but there are other things—things you can have plenty of."</p><p>Jiang Juan gasped and looked at Xue Fangli with some confusion, wanting to ask what other things he meant, but before he could ask, Xue Fangli kissed him.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the candied fruit was too sweet, or perhaps it was because the person was too sweet; Xue Fangli greedily devoured Jiang Juan's breath without ever being sated.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat in Xue Fangli's arms, being kissed while his waist was also being kneaded forcefully. Soon, Jiang Juan turned into a puddle of water, lacking the strength to cover that hand, his eyes wet with tears.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan pulled back slightly as if he couldn't bear it anymore and wanted to end the kiss, but the words that came out were not what he intended.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Is it sweet?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Sweet."</p><p>"I am afraid of hardship, but..."</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "I can endure some hardships. I can share your hardships with you or bear your burdens if you just comfort me a little."</p><p>"You know how worthless I am. Just give me a kiss and I'll listen to you."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan fluttered his eyelashes and stared at Xue Fangli intently. His gaze was pure and sincere, without any reservations.</p><p>"I also want to take care of you."</p><p>Jiang Juan added this sentence.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a few seconds, then raised his red lips slightly. He lowered his head as if he wanted to kiss Jiang Juan but stopped halfway. They were very close, their breaths mingling.</p><p>"Can you bear my hardships?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was slow. "There aren't many hardships I can give you, but there are other things—things you can have plenty of."</p><p>Jiang Juan gasped and looked at Xue Fangli with some confusion, wanting to ask what other things he meant, but before he could ask, Xue Fangli kissed him.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the candied fruit was too sweet, or perhaps it was because Xue Fangli was too sweet; he greedily devoured Jiang Juan's breath without ever being sated.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat in Xue Fangli's arms, being kissed while his waist was also kneaded forcefully. Soon, he turned into a puddle of water, lacking the strength to cover that hand, his eyes wet with tears.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan pulled back slightly as if he couldn't bear it anymore and wanted to end the kiss, but the words that came out were not what he intended.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Is it sweet?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Sweet."</p><p>"I am afraid of hardship, yet..."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "I can endure some hardships. I can share your suffering with you or bear your burdens, as long as you comfort me a little."</p><p>"You know how pitiful I am. Just give me a kiss and I'll do anything for you."</p><p>With that, Jiang Juan fluttered his eyelashes, staring intently at Xue Fangli with a gaze pure and sincere, devoid of any reservations.</p><p>"I also want to take care of you."</p><p>Jiang Juan added softly.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a few moments before lifting his rosy lips slightly. He lowered his head as if about to kiss Jiang Juan but stopped halfway through, their breaths mingling in the close space between them.</p><p>"Can you bear my hardships?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was slow and deliberate. "There aren't many hardships I can impose on you, but there are other things—things you can indulge in fully."</p><p>Jiang Juan gasped, looking at Xue Fangli with a hint of confusion, about to ask what other things he meant when Xue Fangli kissed him.</p><p>Perhaps it was the sweetness of the candied fruit or perhaps it was Xue Fangli's own sweet nature; he greedily devoured Jiang Juan's breath without ever being satisfied.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat in Xue Fangli's arms, being kissed while his waist was also kneaded forcefully. Soon, he melted into a puddle of water, too weak to cover that hand, his eyes brimming with tears.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan pulled back slightly, as if unable to bear it any longer and wanting to end the kiss, but the words that came out were not what he had intended.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked softly, "Is it sweet?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied simply, "Sweet."</p><p>After finishing, Xue Fangli paused briefly. His fingers brushed against Jiang Juan's lips that had been kissed red, his voice hoarse, "Didn't you say you wanted to hurt me by kissing? Just one kiss counts as hurting?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head, "No."</p><p>"Then I'll kiss you more."</p><p>Jiang Juan smiled at him, his young brows slightly curved. Both his gaze and lips were covered in a layer of moisture. He lightly inserted his fingers into Xue Fangli's, offering himself entirely.</p><p>"I want to hurt you... You can kiss me for as long as you want, I'll let you kiss, I'll let you touch, do whatever you want."</p><p>They had barely woken up when they started fooling around. Jiang Juan was originally sitting on Xue Fangli's lap but ended up being placed on the table without him noticing.</p><p>His clothes were unbuttoned, his bare back pressed against the cold tabletop, causing Jiang Juan's eyelashes to tremble. However, he only wrapped his arms around Xue Fangli's neck, hiding fearfully in his embrace.</p><p>He said he would do whatever he wanted, and truly meant it.</p><p>Xue Fangli almost undressed him completely and placed him on the table, thinking Jiang Juan no longer cared about propriety.</p><p>But that wasn't the case.</p><p>"What are you afraid of?"</p><p>The person lying in his arms bit their knuckle nervously, clearly showing their unease. Xue Fangli held them close with one hand while caressing their nape with the other, comforting Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan had been touched several times, his black hair spreading and wetting a few strands that stuck to his snow-white neck, with his fingertips turning shockingly red.</p><p>He panted lightly, his voice maddeningly arousing, "Can you... be gentler later?"</p><p>Xue Fangli removed his hand from Jiang Juan's while asking, "Gentler about what?"</p><p>"Just..."</p><p>Jiang Juan's fingertips were red, and his face was flushed. He looked up at Xue Fangli but found it impossible to speak.</p><p>"Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli pretended to be confused.</p><p>Unable to help himself, Jiang Juan struggled to suppress his embarrassment, "If you... "</p><p>He couldn't finish his sentence again. Xue Fangli laughed softly and asked him, "What do you want?"</p><p>"... You."</p><p>Jiang Juan finally managed to say it out loud, though his face was buried in Xue Fangli's chest, and his whole body was tinged with a light pink color. His fingers were tightly gripping Xue Fangli's sleeve.</p><p>A feast for the eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time before saying regretfully, "Not today."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyelashes; his heart finally calmed down, but he couldn't help feeling curious, "Why?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Your... illness."</p><p>Previously, Xue Fangli had asked Doctor Sun about this. While minor tussles were fine, if they actually engaged in intimate activities, no one could predict what might happen. After all, Jiang Juan's illness had been flaring up frequently lately, and he needed to be completely healed first.</p><p>"First, get your body in shape."</p><p>A few days ago, Jiang Juan had fallen into a coma, and the Imperial Hospital was at a loss. Manager Wang had summoned several doctors, but after hearing about his symptoms, they were equally helpless. In the end, someone suggested a name.</p><p>— Hua Ling.</p><p>He was a renowned physician in southern China, known as the reincarnation of Hua Tuo and a miracle doctor with extraordinary medical skills. Xue Fangli planned to invite him to the capital to treat Jiang Juan's condition.</p><p>After Jiang Juan heard, he was hesitant to speak.</p><p>His mood was quite complicated. He felt both relieved and somewhat guilty.</p><p>He was relieved that he didn't have to endure pain today, but he had been deceiving Xue Fangli all along about his heart condition; it was all an act.</p><p>Should he confess?</p><p>Jiang Juan reached out to touch his chest, lost in thought.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Noticing his action, Xue Fangli frowned. "Are you in pain again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "N...o..."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to pull back his hand, but it was held by Xue Fangli, who grasped Jiang Juan's hand and began massaging his chest gently.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "If you're uncomfortable, tell me. Why are you enduring it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He really wasn't in discomfort.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>After lying so many times, Jiang Juan had no idea how to clear things up. He could only give up and lean on Xue Fangli's shoulder, letting him massage his chest while he tried to find some amusement in the situation.</p><p>He had escaped another crisis.</p><p>He didn't have to endure pain today either.</p><p>After Jiang Juan heard what was said, he was hesitant to speak.</p><p>His mood was quite complicated.

On one hand, he felt relieved that there would be no pain today; on the other hand, he felt guilty for deceiving Xue Fangli about his heart condition all along—it had been nothing more than an act.</p><p>Should he confess?</p><p>Jiang Juan reached out to touch his chest, lost in thought.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Noticing Jiang Juan's gesture, Xue Fangli frowned. "Are you in pain again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "N...o..."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to pull back his hand, but it was held by Xue Fangli, who gently grasped Jiang Juan's hand and began massaging his chest.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "If you're uncomfortable, tell me.

He could only give up and lean on Xue Fangli's shoulder, allowing him to massage his chest as he tried to find some amusement in the situation.</p><p>Another crisis had been averted.</p><p>He wouldn't have to endure any pain today either.</p><p>Jiang Juan returned to the palace safely and, of course, went to report her safety to Bai Xue Chao.</p><p>After sending someone to Li Wangfu, seeing Jiang Juan push away his hand as if she was not in discomfort, Xue Fangli only then spoke about Bai Xue Chao's recent condition.</p><p>——Bai Xue Chao is sick.</p><p>Jiang Juan fainting at the coronation ceremony naturally did not escape Bai Xue Chao's notice. The elderly man rushed to the palace but heard that even the imperial physicians were at a loss, and later, seeing Xue Fangli order the destruction of the temple, he guessed the situation was dire and fainted as well.</p><p>Since then, he has never fully recovered.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not see Lan Ting upon her return because of this reason. She stayed in the palace, and while she worried about Jiang Juan, she also worried about Bai Xue Chao. Therefore, she requested Xue Fangli to allow her to return home to take care of Bai Xue Chao.</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed "Ah" and sat up hurriedly, "Grandfather is sick?"</p><p>"I must go see him."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not stop her either, "Mm-hmm."</p><p>After taking a bath, Jiang Juan quickly got into the sedan chair. Although Xue Fangli was busy with state affairs and had no time, he did not want to let Jiang Juan go alone, so they went together.</p><p>"Grandfather!"</p><p>The moment Jiang Juan arrived, she could not help but forget about Xue Fangli. She almost ran over, feeling very guilty that her grandfather fell ill because of her.</p><p>Pushing open the door, a pungent medicine smell hit her immediately.</p><p>"Grandfather…"</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned. Lan Ting and Bai Xue Chao lying on the bed both turned their heads to see her. Upon seeing Jiang Juan, Bai Xue Chao, who had looked exhausted, was overjoyed. He hurriedly said, "Come quickly, let Grandfather take a look."</p><p>"Young Master, you're finally safe."</p><p>Snow White was startled at the sight of Jiang Juan and let out a sigh of relief. Who knew what kind of fright she had gone through these few days?</p><p>Jiang Juan smiled at her and sat beside the bed, allowing Snow White to examine him.</p><p>"You've lost weight, quite a bit."</p><p>Snow White sighed but then patted his hand with a sense of relief. "At least he has woken up, able to run and jump. These past few days have really scared Grandpa to death."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt guilty and said, "I'm sorry..."</p><p>Snow White waved her hand. "What are you apologizing for? It's Grandpa who is getting too old and useless; the naughty grandson fell sick, and he couldn't do anything to help."</p><p>"But Doctor did his best."</p><p>Lanting remarked, "Didn't you also contact your friend for Master? That was the famous physician surnamed Hua. You asked him to come to the capital to examine Master?"</p><p>At this point, Lanting recalled something and turned to Snow White again. "Doctor, since Master is awake now, should we send a letter asking that friend not to come anymore?"</p><p>Snow White suddenly understood and said, "Yes, since the naughty grandson has woken up, there's no need for him to come anymore. Quickly ask someone—"</p><p>"Grandpa, don't."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked; he was fine, but since this doctor was so skilled, it couldn't hurt to have a second opinion.</p><p>"Or perhaps... let him come?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "His Majesty coughs up blood all the time, and I'm really worried about him. It would be good if your friend could examine him."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the door was pushed open, and Schelangli, who had lagged behind Jiang Juan, walked in at a leisurely pace. He happened to hear Jiang Juan's last words and stopped abruptly.</p><p>Schelangli: "..."</p>
