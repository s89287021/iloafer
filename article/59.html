						<p>Queen?</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke very sincerely: "Prince, stay awake. You're so sick now; you should take care of yourself properly and not worry too much."</p><p>No matter how comfortable they lived now, if they couldn't run fast enough later on, they might end up dying a painful death.</p><p>Jiang Juan was too worried about it; Xue Fangli looked at him a few times and said calmly, "Then don't be afraid of anything from now on."</p><p>"You dare to treat this king with such arrogance. When you encounter outsiders—Prince Ping'an and the Second Son—you only know how to hide in my arms, why can't you show me the same attitude and order them around?"</p><p>Jiang Juan stammered: "It's different."</p><p>"If this king doesn't treat you well, they might not do so either."</p><p>Recently, Jiang Juan had been trying to be careful every day, but he ended up embarrassing Prince Ping'an or stepping on the toes of the protagonist. What could he do? He could only swear that he would never offend them again in the future.</p><p>"How will this king treat you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and smiled deeply, "This king is just waiting..."</p><p>Waiting for what? He didn't say. Xue Fangli lowered his head; his rough, clear fingers gently rubbed Jiang Juan's lips. He slowly said, "Jiang Lan, this king's patience is running out."</p><p>After saying that, the corners of Xue Fangli's mouth curled up slightly. He smiled calmly but his eyes were full of aggression.</p><p>Jiang Juan let out an "ah", inexplicably feeling a bit of danger, which made him not dare to ask about his patience at all and only wanted to lie low and pretend to be dead.</p><p>After some thought, with a "slap" sound, Jiang Juan cupped Xue Fangli's face in his hands, turning his head so he wouldn't look at him anymore.</p><p>The sense of danger finally disappeared, and Jiang Juan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Today, he remained a happy little salted fish.</p><p>Happy moments are fleeting.</p><p>After lunch, Jiang Juan was compelled to reopen his business, and Xue Fangli arrived at the imperial stables.</p><p>The imperial stables were located outside the suburbs of the capital.</p><p>The late emperor loved horses and was proficient in horsemanship; hence, he established this vast complex covering a hundred miles, which was open and flat with lush grass and abundant water.</p><p>It was now the transitional period between spring and summer, and the afternoon was the most comfortable time. Hong Xing Emperor did not ride a horse; instead, he wandered around, stopping occasionally to converse with his companions.</p><p>"Fei Yue, how is it?"</p><p>Hong Xing Emperor appeared at ease. "Last night at the banquet, wasn't Lord Wu's son rather subdued?"</p><p>There was no need for him to be overly restrained; after all, during the banquet, Duke Li had ordered the second son of the Ministry of Personnel to kneel until he bled profusely over a mere title. However, if one were to scrutinize it, there were valid reasons. As a prince, he was not at fault per se, yet being a ruler made him intolerable.</p><p>—to be a monarch, one must be clear and magnanimous; otherwise, when he is displeased, his arbitrary execution of officials and civilians would be unbearable?</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled but did not give a direct answer. "The prince does indeed indulge the princess."</p><p>Noticing his reserve, Hong Xing Emperor shook his head. "In the past, without any burdens, he acted naturally with no inhibitions; however, now that he has attachments, it is inevitable that he will change, and this is a good thing."</p><p>Su Feiyue nodded. "As you say, Your Majesty."</p><p>"What about that old man? It's time for him to settle his affairs."</p><p>Hong Xing Emperor chuckled dryly. "According to custom, … how could this uncle harm him? Why does he still want to live?"</p><p>Su Feiyue did not wish to bring up the matter and could only smile along. Seeing Su Feiyue's gloomy expression, Hong Xing Emperor was in high spirits instead. "That old man has become a shrewd individual; in the end, he suffered a significant loss."</p><p>Today, he remained as carefree as ever, much like a happy little salted fish.</p><p>Happy moments are but fleeting.</p><p>After lunch, Jiang Juan reluctantly resumed his business, and Xue Fangli arrived at the imperial stables.</p><p>The imperial stables were situated beyond the capital's suburbs.</p><p>The late emperor was fond of horses and skilled in horsemanship, so he had established this sprawling complex covering a hundred miles, which was open and flat with lush grass and abundant water.</p><p>It was now the transitional period between spring and summer, and the afternoon was particularly pleasant.

"That old man has become a shrewd individual; in the end, he suffered a significant loss."</p><p>As the sound died away, Governor Wang approached with a beaming smile, "Your Majesty, Prince Wang and Princess Wang have arrived. Shall I call them over?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing: "Call them over."</p><p>Governor Wang turned to leave but was stopped by Emperor Hongxing, who waved his hand dismissively, "Forget it; just let the Fifth Son come alone. His princess is as thin as a sheet of paper. Find him a tent so he can rest properly."</p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli dismounted from the carriage. Governor Wang quickly ran over, his face also full of smiles, "Prince Wang, Your Majesty has summoned you to have a few words with him."</p><p>Xue Fangli turned to Jiang Juan, "Shall this Prince accompany you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at where Emperor Hongxing was standing—surrounded by an imposing retinue that would be easy to spot. He saw them far off and his laziness immediately kicked in, "I don't want to go."</p><p>Governor Wang replied, "Prince Wang, you may go ahead. Your Majesty has already instructed me to take Princess Wang to the tent to rest. I'll look after her for you."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan with his eyes, asking for his opinion. With a tent available, Jiang Juan of course chose to stay put and said, "Prince Wang, we'll wait for you to return."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and told Jiang Juan, "Don't wander off. When this Prince returns, I'll take you horseback riding."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. Governor Wang led him towards the tent area, and Xue Fangli also left with a group of palace attendants.</p><p>Throughout the journey, the sound of hooves echoed and laughter rang out. Jiang Juan glanced around, and Governor Wang explained, "Your Majesty is in good spirits today and not only invited Prince Wang and Princess Wang but also several Princes and Princesses. He also asked many officials to bring their families along. These are all the young masters from the mansion."</p><p>Jiang Juan was unsurprised; he simply said "Oh" to show that he was listening, then began to think about another matter.</p><p>Had the main characters already learned of what had happened at the Long Princess's residence?</p><p>Xue Congjun and company certainly knew this much.</p><p>Schlick! Xue Congjun rode his horse and whipped it with a reins, asking sternly, "What is it?"</p><p>Baodan, the maid serving Princess Mei—mother of the Crown Prince, was lashed by the whip, which scattered her hair. Baodan trembled as she knelt down, "My Lord, spare my life. It was all due to my mouth..."</p><p>"—"</p><p>Xue Congjun's face remained stern as he raised his whip again. Jiang Qingliang reminded him, "—don't scare her anymore; the more you scare her, the less likely she is to speak."</p><p>Xue Congjun cursed him, "Just be merciful to women."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang, who had been unjustly scolded, nearly flipped his eyes out of their sockets. He bit into a peach viciously and threw the pit at Xue Congjun before asking Baodan, "Spill it, what exactly happened?"</p><p>Baodan's face turned pale as she said, "I only heard it. Last night, Princess Chang held a banquet and invited Young Master Second halfway through. Then, then—"</p><p>"Young Master Second was forced to apologize to Lady Li Wang."</p><p>The rest was known because everyone knew how close Young Master Second was to these gentlemen. Baodan didn't dare say more.</p><p>Young Master Second of the Ministry of Personnel's family was a person of great importance in the capital. However, last night, under the watchful eyes of everyone present, his gentle and composed facade was torn apart. He was forced down by guards, and no one knew how many times he knelt before Lady Li Wang or how much blood he shed while apologizing.</p><p>He admitted orally that he knew Lord Ji had an engagement but still refused to avoid suspicion.</p><p>He also admitted to having done wrong to Lady Li Wang.</p><p>Baodan felt utterly shocked upon hearing this.</p><p>Young Master Second was highly regarded in the capital. He was benevolent, kind-hearted, and his mannerisms were pleasant, so much so that even the Empress Dowager favored him. Baodan simply could not understand how such a person could do something like this?</p><p>Knowing Lord Ji had an engagement but still refusing to avoid suspicion was disrespectful.</p><p>Lord Ji's fiancée was none other than their Third Young Master in their family, yet he continued his actions as usual, which was simply despicable!</p><p>Not to mention that even after Lord Ji's engagement was dissolved and the Third Young Master married into the Li Wang Family, he still wronged the Third Young Master. Such behavior was truly shameful!</p><p>Baodan, the maid attending Princess Mei—mother of the Crown Prince—was whipped, scattering her hair. Trembling, Baodan knelt before him, "My Lord, spare my life; it was merely due to my tongue..."</p><p>"—"</p><p>Xue Congjun's face remained stern as he raised his whip again. Jiang Qingliang intervened, "—don't scare her further; the more you intimidate her, the less likely she is to speak."</p><p>Xue Congjun cursed him, "Just be merciful towards women."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang, unjustly scolded, nearly burst into tears. He viciously bit a peach and threw the pit at Xue Congjun before asking Baodan, "Spill it; what exactly happened?"</p><p>Baodan's face paled as she explained, "I only heard part of it.

I'm afraid that if I say a few words to him, it might make him faint. Isn't this giving him an excuse to avoid it?"</p><p>Xue Congyun waved her hand and said, "He should go because he is the weakest one; he is the most suitable person to go."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang replied, "He is my sister-in-law, a dear sister-in-law. We shouldn't let others benefit from our efforts. He deserves to be taught a lesson by us."</p><p>Xue Congyun asked, "Didn't I win the archery competition last time? Didn't he call me the best in the world? Shouldn't we use reason and emotion to persuade him, or even force him if necessary?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang remained silent.</p><p>Xue Congyun also fell silent.</p><p>The two looked at each other and gave a forced smile.</p><p>Gu Pu noticed this and frowned. It seemed he had seen through everything. He coldly said, "Brother Nian was humiliated, but the two of you are here pushing each other away with grandiose reasons. In the end, isn't it because you're afraid that if you go, he will no longer associate with us?"</p><p>Xue Congyun whispered, "I have been looking for a fight with Brother Nian for several rounds already. If I do it again, he is definitely going to bear a grudge against me and ignore me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang also admitted guiltfully, "I won the archery competition and even got him to drink alcohol with us. We are brothers-in-law. How can I criticize him?"</p><p>Hearing this, Xue Congyun immediately became angry. "What a Jiang Qingliang! So that's your plan? You don't want to go yourself, so you push me away?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang retorted, "Pushing me away? Always letting me go, are you jealous of how close I am with Brother Juan and want to replace me?"</p><p>Seeing they were about to start another argument, Gu Pu's expression turned grim. "These years, Brother Nian has taken care of the two of you so much. Now that he is gone, is this how you repay him?"</p><p>Gu Pu slowly enunciated each word, his voice naturally cold and now even colder with anger. He said coldly, "If Brother Nian knew about this, he would surely be heartbroken."</p><p>At these words, Xue Congyun and Jiang Qingliang were stunned. They felt ashamed and lowered their heads, condemning themselves in their hearts. Then they took a deep breath, gathering strength in their dan tian—</p><p>"Xue Liu, go quickly!"</p><p>"Jiang, stop dawdling!"</p><p>Gu Puwang was bitterly disappointed, "You guys are really stubborn."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was about to explain but suddenly realized something and angrily retorted, "Gu, you're truly cunning as hell."</p><p>"What? We two are stubborn, aren't you too? When there's time to urge us two on, you've already gone through. Urging us isn't it also because you don't want to go?"</p><p>He said this, and Xue Congjun also figured it out. He angrily roared, "Gu Puwang, you're truly a beast!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "I propose that the one with the most ulterior motives should go."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "This prince agrees."</p><p>The two of them stared at Gu Puwang. Seeing through his true intentions, Gu Puwang remained completely unruffled. He calmly proposed, "Since none of us wants to go, let's all go together, how about that?"</p><p>Why bother dragging Gu Puwang along when he could avoid it himself? Xue Congjun wasn't stupid, "Not how about that."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang also coldly replied, "I think it's not feasible."</p><p>Since there was no other option, Gu Puwang could only sigh and said, "Prince Liu, the three of us will go and talk to him about this matter, are we all too afraid?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "? ? ?"</p><p>Damn, his damn desire for victory came back.</p><p>Xue Congjun held it in and finally managed to speak. Gu Puwang looked at him, nodded understandingly, then sneered, "Alright, I understand, you're afraid."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Laugh? There was nothing he was afraid of in this world. Xue Congjun couldn't bear the slander and his anger surged as he roared at Gu Puwang, "I'm not afraid, it's you who are afraid!"</p><p>"Jiang, stop dawdling!"</p><p>Gu Puwang was bitterly disappointed, "You two are truly stubborn."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was about to explain but suddenly realized something and angrily retorted, "Gu, you're truly cunning as hell."</p><p>"What?

We two are obstinate, aren't you too? When there's time to urge us on, you've already gone through.

Xue Congjun wasn't stupid, "Not how about that."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang also coldly replied, "I think it's not feasible."</p><p>Since there was no other option, Gu Puwang could only sigh and said, "Prince Liu, the three of us will go and talk to him about this matter, are we all too afraid?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "? ? ?"</p><p>Damn, his desire for victory had returned.</p><p>Xue Congjun held it in and finally managed to speak. Gu Puwang looked at him, nodded understandingly, then sneered, "Alright, I understand, you're afraid."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Laugh? There was nothing he was afraid of in this world. Xue Congjun couldn't bear the slander and his anger surged as he roared at Gu Puwang, "I'm not afraid, it's you who are afraid!"</p><p>"That's right, let's go find him. Whoever backs out now is a coward!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "??"</p><p>This was like a sudden disaster. Jiang Qingliang had just managed to extricate himself, only to hear more bad news. He exclaimed in shock, "How come there are only three of us? Why not me? D*mn it, do I dare or don't I?"</p><p>Adding more people wouldn't help; with only three, they would all go together. One less person wasn't an option. Jiang Qingliang was dragged away looking pale and could only vent his frustration in anger, "Gu Puwang, you f*cking—"</p><p>"Tricky!"</p><p>Thanks to Xue Congjun, Jiang Juan's tent and Wang's meeting with Emperor Hongxing were all well-known. The three of them quickly made their way outside Jiang Juan's tent and began sneaking a peek inside.</p><p>It turned out that there was only Jiang Juan in the tent.</p><p>Wang Zongguan stood by his side, serving tea, fanning him, and chatting amiably to keep him entertained since he was alone.</p><p>After scouting the enemy situation, Xue Congjun said, "Hurry up, act fast. Take advantage of my fifth brother not being here; ask your questions and run away. Otherwise, we'll all be in trouble when he returns."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang agreed, "You're right, you go first. We'll follow behind."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "? ? ?"</p><p>He was incredulous, "Do you think I'm stupid?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang put on a fake smile, "Of course not."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>He nearly fought with Xue Congjun but Gu Puwang intervened in time. He said coolly, "No need to argue over this. Since we came together as three, let's go in together. Find out what happened last night and then—"</p><p>Xue Congjun hesitated, "Give him a good dressing-down?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang hesitated, "No way? He has heart disease. If we give him a severe scolding and he falls ill, what should we do?"</p><p>Xue Congyun also felt it was inappropriate and immediately changed his words, "Give him a gentle scolding instead?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "A gentle scolding?"</p><p>Xue Congyun asked him, "Is that too light?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "It's not about the severity. He does have heart disease, doesn't he? I was thinking that no matter how light or heavy the scolding is, it might be too much for him to handle."</p><p>Xue Congyun asked him, "Then...rebuke him? Give him a harsh rebuke?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said, "Can you make it a little lighter? Even if we don't hit him, being too harsh in our words might still upset him."</p><p>Hearing this, Xue Congyun immediately relaxed, "Alright then. We'll give him a gentle rebuke. I'm also afraid he can't take it."</p><p>After they discussed, they reached the consensus to give him a gentle rebuke. Gu Puwang, however, said, "Wait a minute."</p><p>He frowned and asked, "Are we doing this for Niege's sake?"</p><p>Xue Congyun and Jiang Qingliang felt somewhat guilty, but Jiang Qingliang still defended himself, "Isn't it about giving Niege his due? Didn't we see him last time too? He was so weak that he nearly fainted from anger. Can our conscience be at ease with that?"</p><p>Gu Puwang said coolly, "I just thought that Niege has always been kind-hearted. Even if we give him satisfaction, and the person gets seriously hurt, knowing this, Niege would definitely feel guilty."</p><p>"Rebuking is too harsh. Why don't we have a nice chat about this matter? Ask him what his thoughts are on Niege."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Fine with me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Okay."</p><p>The three of them reached an agreement, and Gu Puwang said, "I'll count to three, and then we all go in together."</p><p>Xue Congyun interjected: "Alright, the three of us will advance and retreat together. Whoever runs away from battle is a coward."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang put away her laughter, "Problem."</p><p>Gu Puwang nodded seriously, "Mm."</p><p>"Three, two, one."</p><p>The next second, the tent flap was lifted.</p><p>Jiang Juan, who was drinking water, froze upon seeing Xue Congyun rush in.</p><p>Here they come.</p><p>The main characters have come to cause trouble for him.</p><p>He knew it all along.</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart was pounding with anxiety as he stared unwaveringly at Xue Congyun.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Brother Nie last night——"</p><p>As soon as he spoke a few words, something felt off. Xue Congyun looked left and right, finally realizing the issue. He gritted his teeth and said through clenched jaws, "Jiang Qingliang, Gu Puwang, are you two even human beings!"</p><p>Alright, advance and retreat together, but it turns out only Xue Congyun took it seriously. Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang these two beasts didn't even enter the tent.</p><p>And just as he finished speaking, two voices came from outside the tent.</p><p>Gu Puwang: "Woof."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Woof woof woof."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "???"</p><p>This time, he truly had his heart set on it.</p><p>Xue Congyun fell into silence. Jiang Juan could only ask him proactively, "What? What do you want?"</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>Don't panic; stay calm. How did that just happen?</p><p>Brother Juan is frail and can't be scolded or criticized. I should have a good chat with Brother Juan about what happened last night and find out his thoughts on Niange.</p><p>Xue Congyun calmed his mind and spoke with confidence, "Brother Juan, do you know the four-eared cat? Among all cats with two ears, only those in Jianzhou Prefecture of Sichuan have overlapping contours, forming two large and two small ears, making a total of four ears."</p><p>"A few days ago, His Majesty the Emperor got a four-eared cat. It's quite adorable. I have a horse-riding competition soon, and if I win, I can take this cat home to keep it. Do you want to keep it? I'll bring it back for you to play with."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Gu Puwang: "..."</p><p>They were speechless, and Jiang Juan was also quite surprised.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Given that he's the main character in this as the Sixth Prince, shouldn't he be severely scolded instead?</p><p>Why is he even getting a cat?</p><p>Jiang Juan was utterly confused.</p><p>Isn't this Sixth Prince actually a fool?</p>
