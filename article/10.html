						<p>The slanted beams of light pierced through the gaps in the bamboo curtains, falling precisely on his clean face. The jade beads swung incessantly; it was hard to tell whether he or the beads were more translucent. The young man's eyelashes fluttered gently, soft and pure, like a small Bodhisattva on a lotus pedestal.</p><p>He was right there, within reach, yet seemed as elusive as clouds and mist that would always dissipate without a trace.</p><p>As he gazed at him, Schue Fangli suddenly had an idea.</p><p>Make him dirty.</p><p>Drag him into the mundane world.</p><p>But with such purity, making him dirty seemed like a waste.</p><p>Schue Fangli lowered his eyelids. Soon after, he plucked something from Jiang Juan's shoulder, saying calmly, "Wolf fur."</p><p>His entire action seemed to be solely for picking up the wolf fur. Jiang Juan blinked but did not overthink it, "I was with the wolf cub earlier and might have brushed against it."</p><p>Schue Fangli nodded, "Mm."</p><p>The conversation ended peacefully.</p><p>High Minister: "?"</p><p>Just this? Just this?</p><p>The Prince did not get angry; he did not punish them either.</p><p>What is going on?</p><p>High Minister was utterly bewildered but then realized something—the prince had already broken precedent from the wedding ceremony to saving the wolf cub, and now giving the scent pouch.</p><p>Once or twice might be acceptable, but a third time…</p><p>That was spices!</p><p>Why didn't the Prince get angry?</p><p>They managed to save one life?!</p><p>High Official Shi was greatly shocked, but at the same time, he vaguely understood something.</p><p>Third Young Master absolutely cannot be offended!</p><p>No matter what plans the Prince has, considering his favoritism toward Third Young Master, he must always be on his best behavior from now on!</p><p>The spices can't be used, and the sachet is also unusable. Jiang Juan felt a bit upset and couldn't help asking Xue Fangli, "Prince, then what are you going to do later?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at High Official Shi, indicating that he would handle it. Jiang Juan responded with an "oh" and added, "Then... you're going to rest now?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied coolly. Jiang Juan knew he should leave, but after a few steps, he turned back again, still wanting to keep the sachet. He insisted, "Just in case it can be used."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at it without responding.</p><p>Jiang Juan handed over the sachet and left contentedly.</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't look at the sachet; he merely played with it in his hand for a moment before speaking calmly.</p><p>"Tell me, what happened."</p><p>"I was just coming to deliver the spices when Third Young Master's maid carelessly bumped into me. I couldn't hold on tight, and the box slipped out of my hands..."</p><p>That was indeed how it happened, but no matter how careless the maid was, if he had avoided in time, things wouldn't have escalated this way. For a situation that should be evenly blamed on both parties, High Official Shi shifted all the responsibility onto the other person.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with a smile that did not quite reach his eyes. Gao Guoshi felt his heart fill with anxiety when he was stared down by the Prince. In front of the Prince, it seemed as if all his thoughts and intentions could be easily read through, and there was no place for any concealment in his actions.</p><p>The intense pressure made Gao Guoshi break into a cold sweat. He gritted his teeth and said, "By the way, Your Highness, that servant girl mentioned something about Third Young Master needing a medicinal bath. I guessed she wanted to ask if there were any herbs on the manor."</p><p>A medicinal bath.</p><p>So that’s what it was.</p><p>Years of nurturing had given this young man such an herbal scent.</p><p>"I’ll give him whatever he needs."</p><p>"Your Highness, it seems there are no …"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Gao Guoshi realized he was being foolish and wished he could slap himself. He flattered, "There are none on the manor, but I can go buy some from town or take some back from my residence."</p><p>Xue Fangli’s eyebrows furrowed in cold displeasure, reaching its peak. His voice harsh and stern, he said, "Get out."</p><p>Gao Guoshi immediately left, but before closing the door, he had to ask one more question, "Your Highness, may I take a box of your incense back to my residence as well?"</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly. The mixed fragrance of the sachet irritated him, yet it still carried some traces of youthful charm. He said expressionlessly, "You don’t need so much."</p><p>He had come to the manor to rest for a night.</p><p>Since his mood was already calm, there was no need to use more incense.</p><p>After this incident, Gao Guoshi showed even greater respect when he visited the villa again.</p><p>"Madame, are you planning on taking a medicinal bath?" Gao Guoshi asked. "Is there a fixed formula?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to forget this matter when he said uncertainly, "Should be there, right?"</p><p>Of course, there was a prescription. Jiang Juan did not know it, but Lanting had memorized it thoroughly. She hesitated and asked, "Manager, are you asking about the prescription...?"</p><p>The high manager smiled and replied, "His Highness the Prince Wang has instructed that if Lady Wang is lacking anything, she should mention it, and I shall prepare it for her."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and sincerely said, "His Highness the Prince Wang is truly kind."</p><p>It's just that he died too early.</p><p>The high manager: "..."</p><p>He forced a somewhat embarrassed but polite smile. He could not continue that conversation.</p><p>Lanting had originally blamed herself, thinking that Young Master would no longer be able to take a medicinal bath. Upon hearing this, she was finally relieved and reported the prescription to the high manager: "One liang of Radix Cyperi, three liangs of Paulownia leaves, one liang of Angelica dahurica..."</p><p>The high manager was taken aback, seeming that these were all rather expensive herbs.</p><p>As far as he knew, Third Young Master had lived in the countryside with his grandfather for many years. Did he use such expensive herbs back then?</p><p>No, Third Young Master did go to the capital to seek medical treatment, so it must be a new prescription from the doctor.</p><p>The high manager did not think much about it and simply recorded the prescription as instructed by His Highness the Prince Wang, promising to get everything needed. After that, he rushed down the mountain without delay.</p><p>A few hours later, the medicine bag finally arrived. Lanting hurriedly prepared for the medicinal bath. Once everything was ready, she went forward to help Jiang Juan undress, but Jiang Juan shook his head and said, "I'll do it myself."</p><p>Lanting hesitated for a moment before stepping outside. After Jiang Juan had entered the bathtub, she came in to tie up his hair.</p><p>In the firelight, the young man's eyelashes hung lightly, and his face was smooth as jade. Lanting watched him and softly said, "Young Master has changed so much."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan jumped in surprise, only then realizing that he had not hidden his true nature, and Lanting had served a long-ago Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He had underestimated the situation.</p><p>"Master Ananda's prediction was truly accurate," Lan Ting continued, "he said Young Master would face a calamity in his eighteenth year. If he could endure it, double blessings would come his way, though his disposition might change; if not... fortunately, Young Master is fine."</p><p>After a pause, Lan Ting pressed her lips together and smiled, "Young Master is doing well this way."</p><p>He was no longer so gloomy, no longer prone to overthinking, his heart had softened considerably, and he seemed much more cheerful.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled by her words. Fortunately, Lan Ting managed to explain herself, and Jiang Juan relaxed.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan was quite curious about Master Ananda. He wanted to ask Lan Ting about it but was afraid of revealing too much, so he lay on the bathtub and tried to recall if there was any mention of this character in the original text.</p><p>Master Ananda.</p><p>Ananda.</p><p>As night fell, the villa was unusually quiet. The rustling wind and the soft sounds blended together. Jiang Juan thought hard but found nothing. Just as he was about to ask Lan Ting, he suddenly heard some noises.</p><p>"Clang—!"</p><p>"Clang, clang, clang—!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. Lan Ting handed him her clean clothes and went over to investigate the sound herself.</p><p>It sounded like a young wolf banging against its cage. Jiang Juan listened for a moment before putting on his outer robe. Unable to find his shoes, he walked over barefoot.</p><p>It really was him.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Jiang Juan asked.</p><p>Lanting shook her head, just as helpless. She made room for Jiang Juan, and the wolf pup whimpered pitifully at him, urgent and desperate.</p><p>This young wolf was quite intelligent; it would seek help when in danger and whine to people if hurt. Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment before opening its cage and asking, "What do you want?"</p><p>The young wolf limped out of the cage and quickly slipped through the half-closed door.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't dare let it run around freely and hurried after it.</p><p>Lanting was about to say something but suddenly saw Jiang Juan's bare feet and his body covered in water vapor, startling her so much that she bit her tongue. For a long time, no words came out of her mouth. When she finally recovered, the wolf pup was gone, as was Jiang Juan.</p><p>Lanting immediately grew anxious and rushed out to follow them.</p><p>Where is Young Master going with his disheveled clothes?</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't know where he was going either. The young wolf ran haphazardly, and Jiang Juan followed it without paying attention to the direction until he saw a pavilion.</p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p>The guards outside the pavilion instantly became alert, drawing their swords closer. However, when they recognized the person, they were all taken aback.</p><p>The youth was enveloped in water vapor; even his loosely tied hair was damp, and beneath his large outer robe, he had bare feet that were fair and beautiful.</p><p>"Princess... Pr-Princess..."</p><p>They recognized Jiang Juan and immediately averted their eyes, stammering to block him, "Young Lord is resting and does not allow anyone inside."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't care about that. The wolf pup had already climbed up, so he hurriedly approached. The guards wanted to stop him but were hesitant.</p><p>—If they stopped him, there would surely be a struggle, and Young Lord might get angry.</p><p>But when the Prince was resting, no one was allowed to enter, including them!</p><p>In a moment of indecision, Jiang Juan had already walked into the attic. The guards looked at each other and finally gritted their teeth, following him.</p><p>Upon entering the attic, the young wolf lowered its head and sniffed along the way. Jiang Juan, distracted, didn't notice where it had gone, while he himself had already stood outside Xue Fangli's door.</p><p>He first looked around to make sure the young wolf wasn't there before knocking on the door with some embarrassment.</p><p>—"Earlier, Lanting knocked over some spices. It's so late, and I still can't find the puppy."</p><p>"…Prince?"</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Had he fallen asleep?</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned, suddenly remembering the plot.</p><p>—"That night, Wang Xie was at his villa. In the middle of the night, he suffered from an acute illness and coughed up blood uncontrollably…"</p><p>It wasn't late anymore. Had the Prince already fallen ill?</p><p>Thinking this, Jiang Juan knocked on the door several more times but still received no response. He couldn't help feeling worried and finally pushed open the door.</p><p>In the next second, his heart almost stopped.</p><p>The attic was silent, with curtains fluttering in the wind. The man's elaborate robe dragged along the ground as he held a sword in hand, standing casually yet fiercely facing seven or eight wolves.</p><p>Hearing the "creak" of the door, Xue Fangli did not turn around. His robe whistled in the wind, and his crimson lips twitched, as if mocking or sighing, "Ignoring you, yet still joining the commotion."</p><p>"You are truly a little Bodhisattva, unable to bear anyone suffering or enduring hardship."</p>
