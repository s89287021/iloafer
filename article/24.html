						<p>Xue Fangli was taken aback.</p><p>An indescribable emotion surged in his heart. This was a feeling he had never experienced before, intense and scorching.</p><p>At this moment, the wind did not rise, the banners did not flutter, yet something was still in turmoil.</p><p>Jiang Juan remained unaware, only suddenly remembering something, "Ah," he said, "Your Highness, you don't seem to believe in ghosts and spirits, so it's okay."</p><p>Xue Fangli just looked at him for a long time before gently asking Jiang Juan, "Do you hurt?"</p><p>"What?" Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, quickly realizing he was asked about the pain in his own hand. He hesitated slightly, "It's fine, I don't hurt."</p><p>"You're lying again."</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was light and unhurried, his expression unreadable, "If it doesn't hurt, why are you crying?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't embarrassed to be caught red-handed and said very boldly, "I have always been afraid of pain."</p><p>After a pause, he stopped pretending. Jiang Juan sincerely begged, "Your Highness, could you please be gentle next time?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had undergone several major and minor surgeries due to his heart condition, and the period after the anesthesia wore off was his nightmare. Jiang Juan often felt pain so severe that he would lose consciousness, wildly grabbing at whatever was near him, which was usually his family's hands. Therefore, he could understand Xue Fangli very well.</p><p>He finished speaking, there was silence, a long-lasting silence.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>After a long time, Xue Fangli finally spoke up. He said calmly, "This King does not believe in ghosts and spirits, but... this is your fortune."</p><p>"This King wants it too."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him, raised his hand to touch Xue Fangli's hair, and softly said, "All the good luck goes to you, Your Highness. You will have no more worries in the future."</p><p>Regarding the Kangzhuang procedure, with His Highness being in such a condition, it's unlikely to be possible now. We can only hope he'll fight another day.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed heavily. His Lo-han beads were all counted out, so he said to Xue Fangli, "His Highness, we can leave."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not take Jiang Juan anywhere else but directly to the monks' quarters in Miaoling Temple.</p><p>Unlike the luxurious bedrooms described in Zhuangzi, the temple's monk quarters were much more austere. Jiang Juan sat on the bed and suddenly heard Xue Fangli order the chief steward, "Ask the abbot to come over."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>His body stiffened, but he did not forget that the abbot was an expert in acupuncture. Having the abbot come over might mean trouble for him.</p><p>Thinking it through, Jiang Juan said slowly, "His Highness, my heart condition isn't very severe. There's no need to bother the abbot."</p><p>"You often complain of chest pain," Xue Fangli replied coolly, "and recently you've also injured your foot. You haven't had a medicinal bath either. Let him attend to you."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head vigorously, "I can take a medicinal bath in a few days; there's no need for the abbot to attend to me."</p><p>His resistance was too obvious, and Xue Fangli glanced at him thoughtfully, saying, "This King has been suffering from a splitting headache recently. Having the abbot come over might also let him examine this King."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Alright."</p><p>He was pretending to be sick, while His Highness was genuinely ill. No matter how unwilling Jiang Juan was for the abbot to come, he could only reluctantly agree.</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli smiled lightly, "Acupuncture doesn't hurt."</p><p>"But the needles are so long..."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt utterly desperate. As he spoke, he suddenly remembered something and asked Xue Fangli, "His Highness, would you like me to give you a massage instead?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had also received a massage from Xue Fangli, and he felt that the effect was decent. He should be able to go back to work again.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan's high spirits, Xue Fangli did not refuse. He nodded and said, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked around left and right, looking rather uncomfortable, so he patted a spot beside him and said, "Your Highness, you can sit here."</p><p>Xue Fangli sat down as instructed, and Jiang Juan leaned in.</p><p>He did not immediately start working, after all, he was just an amateur massage master with little practical experience. Jiang Juan's eyebrows slightly lowered as he pondered the locations of various acupoints.</p><p>Xue Fangli watched him.</p><p>His eyelashes were quite long.</p><p>When they fluttered, it seemed as if they might softly touch at any moment, inexplicably causing a tickling sensation.</p><p>And with each inhalation and exhalation, sweet breaths surrounded him, fresh like the grass after spring rain, creating an atmosphere of such tranquility.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Juan raised his head, and his long eyelashes lightly fluttered. Xue Fangli looked at them for a few moments before reaching out his hand.</p><p>This hand was pale and slender, but it was undoubtedly beautiful. His fingertips brushed past the corner of Jiang Juan's eye, then as if by chance, they grazed something.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled, "Your Highness, what is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly said, "There's incense ash here."</p><p>His fingers had not yet left when Jiang Juan felt an itch and could not help but step back, but he let the hand continue its movements. He strangely asked, "Is it done yet?"</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli retracted his hand, "Done."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Mm, thank you."</p><p>Xue Fangli said nothing, merely gazing at the withdrawn hand with a pensive expression.</p><p>The soft sensation at the tip of his fingers lingered for a while.</p><p>His eyelashes, which he imagined to be hard, were actually softer than expected. When they brushed past his fingertips, it was itchier than he had thought.</p><p>He lightly pinched a few times, sweeping over an imaginary residue of incense ash.</p><p>Jiang Juan roughly recalled the acupoints and began his massage.</p><p>Due to the height difference, even if Xue Fangli sat down, he would still be taller than Jiang Juan. He had to lift his hand to press, so after a short while, Jiang Juan couldn't continue.</p><p>"Raising my arm is so tiring."</p><p>Jiang Juan, true to her nickname as the one who feared pain and fatigue the most, found this unacceptable. After a few seconds of thought, she said to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, would you mind resting your head on my legs?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not immediately respond. Jiang Juan had already sat down, afraid that Xue Fangli might refuse her massage. She assured him, "It won't take long; I'll finish soon."</p><p>Finally someone was letting him do the massage, and Jiang Juan didn't want to let Xue Fangli go. Her tone unconsciously became softer.</p><p>Acting like a spoiled child.</p><p>Xue Fangli idly thought, but eventually murmured an “okay” and rested his head on her legs as instructed.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered her head; this was indeed more convenient. She awkwardly searched for the acupoints, her hands very gentle.</p><p>But massage requires force, and her light touch was ineffective, making it feel like a cat rubbing against him continuously.</p><p>Over the few days at Miaoling Temple, Xue Fangli had stayed alone in another courtyard, naturally leading to sleepless nights. Now, resting on Jiang Juan's body with the faint scent of medicinal herbs surrounding him, Xue Fangli regained his calm and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli fell asleep, and Jiang Juan discovered it. He felt that this was due to his massage; the prince even slept soundly.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very satisfied with the results of his practice, but he insisted on completing the massage, pressing each acupoint thoroughly.</p><p>Just as he finished, Gao Guanshi knocked on the door.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>"Hush."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head and made a gesture to him, but it was too late; Xue Fangli had already been awakened by the noise.</p><p>A sharp pain shot through his temple. He lifted his head without any expression, and his fierce gaze startled Gao Guanshi deeply, "Slave...slave..."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not bother listening to his nonsense, "What is it?"</p><p>Gao Guanshi stuttered, "The abbot is currently unavailable and will only be able to come later. Also—about the memorial service for the Concubine Yu, will the prince participate?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Xue Fangli said these two words indifferently, and Gao Guanshi hurriedly bowed his head, prepared to leave when he heard Jiang Juan asking, "Prince, won't you attend the memorial service for your mother?"</p><p>"Well...can I go?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked this question not only out of sympathy for Concubine Yu but also to take the opportunity to run away and hide from the abbot. He planned to watch the prince's headache subside before returning.</p><p>Jiang Juan sincerely said, "I haven't finished copying the scriptures yet, so I want to attend the memorial service."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "You don't need to. Go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan said curiously, "But I'm not tired and don't want to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Stay with this prince and sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Why did he suddenly add a "sleeping company" service?</p><p>Jiang Juan was hesitant to speak, while Xue Fangli irritably glared at the chief official. "Get lost quickly."</p><p>The chief official bowed and immediately left, but Jiang Juan still wanted to struggle. He said, "Your Highness, I'm not tired."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and suddenly said, "Do you know that my grandmother was there for those fourteen days when she made me kneel?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids without any expression and said, "This prince witnessed her decay."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, shocked, and Xue Fangli looked tired as he said, "Every year on her memorial day, this prince dreams of those fourteen days, repeatedly seeing her decay."</p><p>It was so horrifying that Jiang Juan didn't know what to say. He looked at Xue Fangli, wanting to console him but not knowing how, so he climbed onto the bed and expressed everything through his actions.</p><p>"Alright then, I'll stay with you for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt great sympathy and said, "Don't think anymore, I'm right here. If you have nightmares again, call me."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded without expression with an "uh-huh." He looked at Jiang Juan's furrowed brow, but his pale lips slightly curled upward in a casual smile.</p><p>How could he be so easily softened?</p><p>How did he fall into this man's hands?</p><p>He had nothing, only enough suffering to recount one by one, day after day, to make him heartbroken and then softened for him.</p><p>Jiang Juan was passively activated with the "sleeping company" service.</p><p>Actually, he woke up very early that morning and had run around twice. Only when he got into bed did he realize he was still tired. Jiang Juan decided to take a nap but couldn't get comfortable at all.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't say anything; he only stretched out his hand to pull back the cotton cloth on the bed. As expected, one corner was folded over, and he then said, "My back hurts so much."</p><p>Jiang Juan smoothed it out and lay down again. He hadn't been comfortable for long when he couldn't take it anymore. Jiang Juan rolled over and was in great pain.</p><p>"Your Highness, I can't sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan said uncomfortably, "The bed is too hard."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him. Jiang Juan pursed his lips, one hand placed behind his back. The discomfort of the bed made him annoyed, but when he got angry, his features became lively.</p><p>After a while, Xue Fangli left. He reached out to hug Jiang Juan's waist and gently pulled him into his arms, almost making Jiang Juan crawl onto him.</p><p>Jiang Juan opened his eyes wide, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli said softly, "Go to sleep."</p><p>The bed was hard, and the person wasn't soft either, but he still felt comfortable. However, Jiang Juan found it embarrassing and said, "Maybe I shouldn't sleep..."</p><p>Fate's neck was pressed again, and Jiang Juan buried his face in Xue Fangli's arms. Xue Fangli calmly said, "Go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan moved a few times, couldn't lift his head, and had to submit.</p><p>He claimed he wasn't tired but ended up falling asleep first. Xue Fangli continuously rubbed his neck and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Actually, Jiang Juan woke up very early that morning and had run around twice. Only when he got into bed did he realize he was still exhausted. Deciding to take a nap, he found himself unable to get comfortable at all.</p><p>He tried his best to endure it, enduring again and again, but he couldn't hold back any longer and sat up from the bed.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't respond; instead, he stretched out his hand to pull back the cotton cloth on the bed. As expected, one corner was folded over, and he then said, "My back hurts so much."</p><p>Jiang Juan smoothed it out and lay down again. However, he hadn't been comfortable for long when he couldn't take it anymore. He rolled over and felt intense pain.</p><p>"Your Highness, I can't sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan said uncomfortably, "The bed is too hard."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him. Jiang Juan pursed his lips, one hand placed behind his back. The discomfort of the bed annoyed him, but when he got angry, his features became lively.</p><p>After a while, Xue Fangli left. He reached out to hug Jiang Juan's waist and gently pulled him into his arms, almost making Jiang Juan crawl onto him.</p><p>Jiang Juan opened his eyes wide, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli said softly, "Go to sleep."</p><p>The bed was hard, and the person wasn't soft either, but he still felt comfortable. However, Jiang Juan found it embarrassing and said, "Maybe I shouldn't sleep..."</p><p>Fate's neck was pressed again, and Jiang Juan buried his face in Xue Fangli's arms. Xue Fangli calmly said, "Go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan moved a few times, couldn't lift his head, and had to submit.</p><p>He claimed he wasn't tired but ended up falling asleep first. Xue Fangli continuously rubbed his neck and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>That morning, Jiang Juan had awakened exceptionally early and made two trips out without rest. By the time he got into bed, he was still feeling quite fatigued. Deciding to take a nap, he found himself unable to settle down at all.</p><p>Xue Fangli inquired, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent, reaching out to pull back the cotton sheet. As expected, one corner was folded over, causing him considerable pain, and he finally spoke, "My back hurts terribly."</p><p>Jiang Juan smoothed the blanket out and lay down again, only to find comfort fleeting. He rolled over, writhing in agony.</p><p>"Your Highness, I can't sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan said with a pained expression, "The bed is so hard."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him. Jiang Juan pursed his lips and placed one hand behind his back. The hardness of the bed irked him, but when he became irritated, his features came alive.</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli left. He gently hugged Jiang Juan's waist and pulled him into his embrace, almost causing Jiang Juan to collapse onto him.</p><p>Jiang Juan opened his eyes wide in surprise, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli murmured softly, "Sleep."</p><p>Despite the bed being hard and himself feeling stiff, he found a semblance of comfort. However, Jiang Juan felt embarrassed and said, "Maybe I shouldn't sleep..."</p><p>Fate's neck was pressed once more, and Jiang Juan buried his face in Xue Fangli's arms. Xue Fangli calmly said, "Sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan moved several times, unable to lift his head, and finally submitted.</p><p>He had claimed not to be tired, yet he fell asleep almost immediately. Xue Fangli continued to rub his neck and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>It was unclear how long had passed when he heard a faint breathing sound.</p><p>Someone encircled his neck, biting his shoulder, and cried like a cat. Xue Fangli opened his eyes.</p><p>Nian was drenched with sweat, her eyelashes wet with tears, her face radiating an overwhelming allure.</p><p>He was completely naked, with snow-white skin and a red mole on his neck that seemed almost fluid.</p>
