						<p>Jiang Juan sank into deep thought for a long time.</p><p>The characters were so different; did he come with the wrong script?</p><p>Once all the boxes were on the ground, he turned to say, "Fifth Brother, Emperor Father sent me to attend the ceremony and also bring your father's private gifts for you. Did I come too late?"</p><p>He called him Fifth Brother, his identity was clear.</p><p>The Sixth Prince, Xue Congjun.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Not too late."</p><p>Xue Congjun chuckled. Though he and Xue Fangli were both princes, they did not need to perform any formalities, but others had to. The person accompanying him bowed respectfully and said, "Your servant has met Prince Li."</p><p>"Prince Li, here is the gift list."</p><p>Prince Li did not care about this newly married princess consort. Otherwise, he should have carried the gift list himself.</p><p>But of course, everyone knew that.</p><p>Truly how? He left it unfinished.</p><p>Xue Congjun turned his head upon hearing this. He was close to Jiang Juan and naturally knew that Jiang Juan had recently encountered some troubles. His older brother was pushed around by a rustic—</p><p>Xue Congjun saw Jiang Juan's face clearly and was stunned.</p><p>The youth had a well-proportioned body, with his black hair hanging loosely down.</p><p>The color between his eyebrows was just right—any more would be too much, any less would be too little—it was as unique as the moonlight and snow. Not to mention his pure temperament, he seemed not of this world, almost as if he came from Yaochi Pool.</p><p>Xue Congjun was dazzled and couldn't look away.</p><p>This is Jiang Juan? This rustic bumpkin?</p><p>Why didn't I notice how handsome he was before?</p><p>Eunuch Zhang's reaction was similar. He was stunned for a moment, unused the prepared pleasantries, and instead praised spontaneously, "... truly like snow jade carved, with an exceptionally beautiful appearance."</p><p>How could Third Young Master differ so much from the rumors in the capital?</p><p>They didn't know of the phrase "a person's appearance reflects their heart." The original Jiang Juan had good looks as well, but he was too self-conscious, barely daring to lift his head when meeting people. His demeanor was timid and cowardly, reaching an annoying level, so no one would notice his face.</p><p>The current Jiang Juan was like a child raised in the family, with natural movements devoid of the former petty mannerisms, even exuding an innate air of detachment from the world. It could be said he had undergone a complete transformation.</p><p>Xue Congjun's mind wandered, and he subconsciously nodded along, but his head shook a few times before he came back to his senses.</p><p>Wait, wasn't I here to stand up for Nian Ge!</p><p>No matter how handsome this rustic bumpkin was, he still had an evil heart, far inferior even to the hair strand of his Nian Ge.</p><p>His Nian Ge was beautiful and kind. Unlike this man, who had only a good appearance; they were worlds apart.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Congjun glared at Jiang Juan in anger.</p><p>His gaze was too unfriendly for Jiang Juan to miss, but recognizing this person's identity, he wasn't surprised by the intense hostility directed his way.</p><p>The Sixth Prince was one of the main characters in the group.</p><p>As a favored member of the team, it was only natural for him to dote on the protagonist. In the original text, the Sixth Prince was the youngest prince and much beloved by the Emperor, which had cultivated an extremely domineering personality in him. Whether inside or outside the palace, he was often considered a nuisance.</p><p>Later, he met the Dominated Protagonist. Under the gentle persuasion of the Dominated Protagonist, the Sixth Prince was moved and reined in his wild ways, spending every day following closely behind the Dominated Protagonist, becoming his top little fanboy.</p><p>The little fanboy probably came to take a stand.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't guess wrong; Xue Congjun had deliberately taken on this task. He glared enough to make people flinch, then turned to Xue Fangli and said coldly, "Fifth Brother, Father really does send anyone and everyone to your residence."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over casually, "Hm?"</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Xue Congjun would never dare be so brazen in front of him, after all, Xue Fangli could be terrifying when provoked. He had always been scared of him since childhood, but the situation was special now.</p><p>Xue Congjun needed to stand up for Jiang Nian, and he knew that this marriage arrangement had originally not met with Xue Fangli's approval. It would only proceed smoothly to give his father some face, so Xue Congjun rarely felt so resolute.</p><p>He indignantly declared, "A few days ago, a few days ago, this Jiang Juan pushed my brother Nian—his own brother—into the lake because of a trivial matter. Brother Nian was shocked and chilled, and he still hasn't recovered to this day."</p><p>Having finished speaking, Xue Congjun glanced at Jiang Juan, hoping to see some sign of shame on his face. However, as soon as his gaze fell upon him, Xue Congjun himself became momentarily dazed, forgetting his intention until Jiang Juan looked back at him innocently.</p><p>Xue Congjun: "?"</p><p>What act was this person putting on? How could he look so innocent?</p><p>How could there be such shameless people in the world!</p><p>In reality, not only was Jiang Juan innocent, he was also very justifiable.</p><p>The Jiang Juan who pushed Jiang Nian into the lake was a different person from the one standing before him now. What did that have to do with him?</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Congjun became furious, but he still knew his limits and only said to Xue Fangli, "Fifth Brother, he has such malicious intentions; you must be careful."</p><p>No sooner had he finished speaking than Xue Fangli flicked his eyelids open and stared at him with a smile that wasn't quite a smile. Xue Congjun's heart tightened instantly, his hair standing on end, almost biting his tongue. He forced himself to continue, "If... if I were to say it, Fifth Brother, even if this marriage doesn't work out, Father Emperor has already said it’s all up to you."</p><p>Of course, this was not the actual words of His Majesty. The original statement was:</p><p>"—Go visit your Fifth Brother's place. If the ceremony is held, these are your gifts. But if it doesn’t happen, be smart and don't anger my Fifth Brother.”</p><p>As a father knows his child best, even the current Holy Emperor knew Xue Fangli’s temper and figured that this marriage would not go through; how much more so for Xue Congjun? When he arrived, he found that they had already completed the ceremony, which left him extremely surprised.</p><p>"All up to my will?" Xue Fangli chuckled, naturally knowing it wasn't his original words but didn’t bother to inquire further. "This Wang understands."</p><p>Xue Congjun had spent so much effort speaking just to show off to Jiang Juan, but to Jiang Juan's ears, it meant something else entirely.</p><p>Was he trying to persuade them apart? He originally didn’t want to get involved with Xue Congjun, as he was a high-profile protagonist. He couldn't afford to provoke him, but since Xue Congjun was reporting and saying that if the marriage didn't work out it didn’t matter, even a salted fish couldn't be tolerated.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked softly, "Has the Sixth Prince ever heard of this phrase? Destroying someone's wedding, may lightning strike you down."</p><p>Xue Congjun was stunned. "N-no?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. "Then you’ve heard it now."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "?"</p><p>He didn’t react at first, stammering, "Which marriage did I destroy? I only told Fifth Brother about your character, that someone with a heart like yours, Fifth Brother should have chased you away directly—"</p><p>Xue Congjun paused mid-sentence, finally understanding.</p><p>He opened his mouth, thinking of the lightning strike curse, then closed it again. But Xue Congjun was not the type to back down easily and retorted, "If we don’t talk about that, we won’t. Then what about pushing Niege into the lake? Is that incorrect?"</p><p>As long as Xue Congyun did not persuade him to separate, he would say whatever he wanted. Jiang Juan resumed his slothful nature and replied nonchalantly, "Mm-hmm, you didn't get it wrong."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "……"</p><p>Why was he even more angry?</p><p>Xue Congyun took a deep breath; he had to turn the tables on Jiang Juan. "Since you've admitted it, doesn't it make sense for you to apologize?"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him and said in an extremely flexible manner, "…Sorry?"</p><p>He almost wrote 'fooling' on his face. Xue Congyun was about to explode with anger. "What do you have to be sorry for? I told you to apologize to Ningge!"</p><p>Nothing seemed right. Jiang Juan sighed and explained slowly, "Apologizing to Your Highness is also correct. If I had known earlier that Your Highness has such a strong desire for victory, I would have listened to you without arguing."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan sincerely apologized again, "Sorry."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "……"</p><p>Xue Congyun: "???"</p><p>What was this country bumpkin talking about? What did he mean by having a strong desire for victory?</p><p>Xue Congyun was so angry he wanted to jump. However, the other party was as soft as a cotton ball, making it impossible for him to vent his anger. He held back all his frustration, "I don't have that strong a desire for victory, stop talking nonsense! You did what you did, and I just…"</p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Gonggong softly comforted him, "Your Highness, there's no need to worry. The slave has heard that Third Young Master was only recently brought back to the capital by Lord Jiang. He probably doesn't understand all the rules of the capital yet. Third Young Master didn't have malicious intentions; it's just…"</p><p>His words hinted that Jiang Juan did not know the rules.</p><p>The people in the palace were accustomed to flattering the powerful and belittling the weak. Putting aside the matter of the gift list, Xue Congyun was clearly here to look for trouble. However, Schang Li did not stop him, making his intentions very clear. Zhang Gonggong saw an opportunity to step on Jiang Juan's toes and curry favor with Xue Congyun.</p><p>After a pause, Zhang Gonggong added, "By the way, Your Highness, this is such a joyous occasion, isn't Third Young Master looking rather understated?"</p><p>Xue Congjun froze for a moment, and indeed, he felt delighted inside. He looked down his nose at Jiang Juan and demanded sternly, "Who gets married in all white?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>This is allowed?</p><p>"Are you doing this on purpose?" Xue Congjun seized the opportunity to vent, "Don't you know that my fifth brother's health isn't good? Even if the wedding is rushed, what color would be inappropriate for you to wear instead of wearing such an outfit to make things awkward? Isn't it ominous?"</p><p>Xue Congjun kept talking non-stop, but after waiting for quite a while and hearing no response from Jiang Juan, he felt like he had won a point. His pent-up frustration dissipated, leaving him feeling extremely comfortable all over.</p><p>In reality, Jiang Juan had no intention of responding to him at all.</p><p>He felt so wronged; truly so wronged.</p><p>This outfit was his initial appearance when he entered the story, what could he have done?</p><p>Everything revolves around the patron. Jiang Juan couldn't afford to teach this fool a lesson. He was thinking about how to explain it to Xue Fangli.</p><p>"…I didn't think about it that much."</p><p>While speaking, Jiang Juan subconsciously grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve. Xue Fangli lowered his eyes; the young man frowned slightly, looking quite unhappy and even a bit annoyed, which lessened some of his otherworldly and ethereal aura, making his features appear more lively.</p><p>And Jiang Juan had creased Xue Fangli's sleeve with his grip, against the rich black-gold. The young man's fingers looked very white, almost like porcelain.</p><p>It seemed as if he were being wronged or perhaps even indulging in a little pouting.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him without saying anything.</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Congjun sucked in a cold breath and immediately covered his mouth.</p><p>Who dares to grab his fifth brother's sleeve?</p><p>Is it that you don't want your hands or that you don't want to live?</p><p>Xue Congyun couldn't care less about Jiang Juan's well-being; she didn't really have any intentions towards him. When she tried to remind him, she felt a bit hesitant. Zhang Gonggong, on the other hand, maliciously added fuel to the fire: "Third Young Master, on such a joyous day, if you had just used your head a little more, you wouldn't have—"</p><p>After flattering Xue Congyun, he turned to flatter Xue Fangli as well.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Xue Fangli's hand landed on Jiang Juan's wrist. The exposed part of the boy's arm was thin and frail.</p><p>Sure enough, his fifth brother was about to act.</p><p>Xue Congyun couldn't help but feel pity; she saw Xue Fangli grab Jiang Juan's wrist, tighten it, and then—</p><p>gently release it.</p><p>At the same time, Xue Fangli slowly said, "Enough."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "?"</p><p>The imagined violent scene did not happen. He widened his eyes in surprise.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work today," Xue Fangli spoke to Jiang Juan normally, "Go back to your room and rest now."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't really want to leave; he was afraid that the Prince's son and the eunuch would cause trouble again, especially this eunuch who was very malicious. If he left, he would have to take the blame. Jiang Juan hesitated: "I..."</p><p>Seemingly knowing what he was worried about, Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "This king believes in you."</p><p>Hearing him say that, Jiang Juan blinked, "Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded.</p><p>Jiang Juan stared at him for a long time and felt that Xue Fangli wasn't just fooling around. He immediately became happy and relaxed, "Alright then."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, a smile still lingering at the corners of his lips. He didn't spare a glance for the other two and instructed word by word, "Bring the Concubine back to her chambers to rest."</p><p>He mentioned the Concubine, not Jiang Juan, nor Third Young Master. Xue Congjun's eyelids twitched violently.</p><p>Jiang Juan was led away, and Xue Fangli withdrew his gaze, speaking coolly, "Sixth Brother, have you forgotten what this king hates the most in life?"</p><p>Pausing for a moment, he then looked at Zhang Gonggong. Xue Fangli still had a smile on his face; he seemed relaxed and composed, as if merely engaging in casual conversation, "You all speak of my people having no rules right before me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression remained calm as he said, "Such audacity."</p>
