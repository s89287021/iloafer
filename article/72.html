						<p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be.</p><p>After all the evading, he still couldn't escape social embarrassment. Jiang Juan was in a terrible mood and said gloomily, "I told you it's fine, but you didn't believe me."</p><p>Jiang Juan was in a bad mood, but Jiang Qingliang was even worse off.</p><p>Who knows how it will be? At least Jiang Juan wouldn't get into trouble because the Prince favored him. Jiang Qingliang, on the other hand, did not have this privilege. He knew he would be punished and only wanted to escape as soon as possible.</p><p>"Princ—Prince, I haven't finished running my thirty laps that Father penalized me with. Should I... continue now?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang gritted his teeth and said this, then tried to run away. Xue Fangli naturally wouldn't let him go so easily. "Wait."</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, "Don't you want to take a few more looks?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang wondered if he had misunderstood, "What?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "Don't you like pornographic pictures? Fine, I'll fulfill your wish."</p><p>"Stare for the duration of one incense stick. If you blink even once, I'll light a new incense stick."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "? ? ?"</p><p>Who could endure not blinking for so long?</p><p>Was he supposed to stare all night?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang moved his lips slightly, "Prince, don't you think... the duration of one incense stick is too long?"</p><p>"Too long?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "If you find the time too long, then forget it."</p><p>He was so easy to talk to that Jiang Qingliang was taken aback. Instead of feeling relieved, she felt uneasy. Sure enough, in the next moment, Xue Fangli told the maid, "Take this book and deliver it to our general. Tell him exactly where it came from."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "???"</p><p>She quickly corrected herself, "Your Highness, it won't take long, just a short while, no need to bother my father!"</p><p>In fact, Jiang Qingliang knew that Xue Fangli was simply tormenting her, just like always making her dive into the water to retrieve beads. This time, he had come up with a new trick.</p><p>If her father found out, she would be stripped of several layers of skin, but if he didn't know, he would only glare at her for a night at most.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said gloomily, "I think I'll just take a good look now."</p><p>He hung his head and walked away. This time, he wasn't stopped, but after a few steps, he remembered something and turned back to look at the 'Chun Gong Tu Zhan' in Xue Fangli's hand, hesitating as he said, "Your Highness, this..."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over, "What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang shuddered at being looked at and, seeing no sign that the book would be given to her, dared not say more, "Nothing much, I'm leaving."</p><p>He bowed and ran away, unaware that Xue Fangli had calmly instructed the maid moments after he left the guest room, "Go tell our general that his Wang's concubine is looking at some chaotic things. He confiscated one book, there might be many more where that came from."</p><p>The maid was a servant of the general's residence, and Jiang Qingliang was her young master, but Xue Fangli was the Prince, so she naturally listened to him.</p><p>"Yes, Your Highness, I will inform the General immediately."</p><p>The maid hurriedly did as instructed and left the guest room.</p><p>With her departure, only Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli remained in the guest room.</p><p>"You too."</p><p>After dealing with Jiang Qingliang, Xue Fangli approached Jiang Juan, who said nervously, "What about me? I didn't do anything."</p><p>"Didn't you do anything?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him with a half-smile: "Who told Wang that they felt unwell, so that Wang massaged their chest for a long time?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said: "...That was just to comfort you."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, put down the book he was holding, then embraced Jiang Juan and chuckled softly, "Little liar."</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him. It was just that the pornographic picture was too close to him. He lowered his head to take a quick look, but couldn't help it anymore, so he reached out to push it away. However, before his fingers could touch it, his hand was caught.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Xue Fangli asked.</p><p>Jiang Juan said awkwardly: "You know that this is...a pornographic picture. Why don't you return it? Quickly take it away."</p><p>Xue Fangli, on the other hand, held his waist with one hand and slowly turned the pages of the book with the other, saying leisurely, "Wang was rather curious about what Lady saw just now that she would be misunderstood as having a heart attack."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>"Didn't see anything."</p><p>Jiang Juan gritted his teeth and said: "If you don't take it away, let go quickly. If you want to look, look by yourself; I'm not looking anymore."</p><p>With a rustle, Xue Fangli turned the page and spoke calmly, "Let's read with Wang together."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I don't..."</p><p>Xue Fangli pinched his chin and lowered his gaze, "Why can you watch it with him but not with Wang?"</p><p>"Seems like...Wang is your husband?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said gloomily, "I didn't look at it with Jiang Qingliang. I accidentally picked up the book and just flipped through it out of curiosity."</p><p>"Didn’t you do anything?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him with a half-smile: "Who told Wang that they were feeling unwell, so that Wang massaged their chest for a long time?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said: "... That was just to comfort you."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, put down the book he was holding, then embraced Jiang Juan and chuckled softly, "Little liar."</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him.

I accidentally picked up the book and just flipped through it out of curiosity."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him a few times and finally said "hum," but still didn't let go of Jiang Juan. He casually remarked, "What's the point of looking at it alone? Let's look through it together with Wang."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>The Prince had already watched it once with Jiang Qingliang, yet now he insisted on watching it again with him. After clarifying everything, the Prince still wanted to watch it together. Jiang Juan slowly said, "Your Highness, you're being unreasonable."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored this and only moved his stiff fingers, flipping over to the next page.</p><p>The guest room was quiet, and even the sound of turning pages was faint. Jiang Juan subconsciously glanced over and felt his face flush when he saw the picture clearly.</p><p>"Your Highness, let go of me."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't want to watch again at all and couldn't bear it after just one look. He started trying to pry Xue Fangli's fingers apart but failed; he was still held in his arms.</p><p>"Watch."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained expressionless as he said, "The body is indeed soft."</p><p>Jiang Juan refused to look. Xue Fangli added, "You are pretty soft too. If it were you, you could probably make this pose."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "What pose?"</p><p>He held back his curiosity but eventually peeked again. The flexibility of the person in the picture was astonishing, and Jiang Juan was stunned as he murmured, "No, no, what a tiring pose."</p><p>After speaking, Jiang Juan realized he had been tricked again and felt annoyed and angry. "If you want to look, do it yourself. Why drag me along?"</p><p>Xue Fangli only chuckled a few times without answering.</p><p>"Don't think you can make me watch even one page."</p><p>Jiang Juan made up his mind not to give in and started looking around as he heard the turning of pages, but refused to glance at the book. However, soon Xue Fangli stopped moving, and the sound of turning pages ceased.</p><p>It was so quiet, too quiet.</p><p>Jiang Juan leaned on his shoulder, slightly tilting her head and curiously lifting it up, only to catch a glimpse of the man's deep black eyes.</p><p>"Prince Wang?"</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously called out to him. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan for a long time before suddenly smiling and saying, "Look down."</p><p>His lowering his head must have been to let her see the album. Jiang Juan shook her head, "No."</p><p>"This one you might recognize."</p><p>Jiang Juan resisted intensely, so Xue Fangli's hand went through her waist, picking up the entire album. Even if she didn't want to look, she was forced to take a glance.</p><p>It was indeed familiar.</p><p>The person in the painting sat on a chair, one leg raised while another person was buried in something.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>She pretended to be calm and said, "Familiar? No."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows slightly. He leaned on the bed while Jiang Juan sat in his lap, resting against him with one knee bent, swaying uncomfortably again. Xue Fangli reached out to stroke the bead necklace at her ankle, rubbing it repeatedly.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded hurriedly. Xue Fangli slowly said, "Look."</p><p>She lowered her head, and most of her words fell on Jiang Juan's neck, causing her to instinctively pull back, "It's okay..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You're not looking carefully enough, look."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>The hand that had been rubbing the beads suddenly parted them, as if holding Jiang Juan's ankle, but the fingertips kept massaging his ankle bone. Jiang Juan shivered with a tickle and hastily pushed his hand away.</p><p>"It's not that pretty."</p><p>"It's not that pretty, are you blushing?"</p><p>Xue Fangli opened his mouth again. His chin rested on Jiang Juan's shoulder, and his hot breath fell on Jiang Juan's neck, as if he were soaked in steam. Jiang Juan felt like he was melting away.</p><p>"...It's none of your business."</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart raced slightly faster, beating louder and louder, but he still mouthed stubbornly, "Whatever."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Then this king has to remind you."</p><p>In the next moment, his lips brushed past, leaving a wet mark from the red mole on Jiang Juan's fair neck. Xue Fangli asked him in a soft and slow voice, "Do you remember?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I..."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled gently and said, "If you haven't remembered yet, this king doesn't mind giving you another dose."</p><p>Having been goaded, Jiang Juan couldn't pretend to be asleep anymore. He stammered, "I think I'm starting to remember a bit."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "A bit?"</p><p>He lowered his head again. The familiar, hot breath swept over Jiang Juan's shoulder. Having finished with the ankle bone, his fingers climbed upward, lightly squeezing Jiang Juan's white calf, then moving further up to where it was injured. His fingertips brushed against it gently.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>The wound was still not completely healed, and Jiang Juan's voice trembled slightly as if in pain or perhaps too embarrassed. He almost burst into tears but finally held it back, "I remember now, it looks familiar, it does look familiar."</p><p>His voice was soft and gentle, carrying a hint of grievance, like a small animal that had been bullied fiercely, pitiful.</p><p>Xue Fangli took his time to savor the moment before finally nodding, "Next page."</p><p>Just as the pale fingers touched the book page, Jiang Juan hastily pressed them back down. He shook his head repeatedly, having almost burst into tears just now, this time truly holding back tears.</p><p>—In a hurry.</p><p>"I won't look anymore, I really won't look."</p><p>Knowing that the Prince was deliberately teasing him and seemed to be enjoying it without any intention of stopping soon, Jiang Juan had no choice but to use his special skill.</p><p>"Husband, I won't look."</p><p>He called out softly, asking grievously, "Do you want to kill me, so you can become a widower?"</p><p>"You know that I have a heart disease, and still... "</p><p>bullied him.</p><p>The husband even said it out loud, indicating that he was truly being bullied fiercely. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan, although he felt somewhat regretful—unable to force him to finish looking at the lewd pictures together, and not yet having enough fun teasing Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Fangli decided to call it a day. He embraced Jiang Juan and whispered with a smile, "How could Your Majesty let you go?"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, "I haven't seen you being reluctant either."</p><p>Xue Fangli took Jiang Juan's hand, gently massaging his fingertips and said with lowered eyes, "Your Majesty doesn't want to be a widower. Your Majesty only wants Your Majesty's wife to be healthy, and to play around with Your Majesty more often, to accompany Your Majesty more."</p><p>to accompany him more.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, raising her head to look at Xue Fangli. It took her a long time before she said, "Your Highness, I will stay with you for a few more days... That is... since you are coughing up blood so severely, you must try your best to stay with me for a few more days. Don't leave too early; I really don't want to send you off too soon."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at her and smiled softly, "If you don't leave, Your Majesty naturally won't leave either. Your Majesty will stay with you until the very end."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head and corrected him, "I will stay with you until the very end."</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Xue Fangli was about to say something else when footsteps came hurriedly, followed by a knock on the door. Jiang Sen Tao said in a low voice, "Your Highness, Princess Consort, His Majesty has had an accident. He suddenly fainted while correcting memorials just now. Hurry and come with this subordinate into the palace!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned to hear this.</p><p>Fainted?</p><p>The emperor fainted?</p><p>In novels, this was a turning point in the plot. When Emperor Hongxing fainted, it meant that his body had been destroyed by medicine, and chaos was about to ensue.</p><p>At the same time, the plot for Duke of Anping declaring himself emperor also needed to be arranged.</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent for a few seconds before immediately changing her words, "Your Highness, the Duke might give us all a final send-off."</p>
