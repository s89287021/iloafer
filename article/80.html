						<p>On the fifteenth day of May, it is auspicious for sacrifices.</p><p>Before dawn, Jiang Juan was awakened by a shake.</p><p>The Prince was bestowed the title of Crown Prince, yet he had to endure hardship. Jiang Juan sat up dazedly, still in a state of confusion. After washing up, Lan Ting brought him some clothes, and he dressed himself.</p><p>"Come over."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and said coolly, "Jiang Juan." Jiang Juan nodded but then buried his head into Xue Fangli's chest, rubbing against him for a while before finally gathering the strength to say, "Why does ancestor worship have to be so early? Don't ancestors sleep?"</p><p>"Why don't they sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan's long hair fell over his shoulders, flying around as he rubbed. Xue Fangli reached out to smooth it, saying lazily, "Don't the ancestors in the palace complain?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>The Prince was mocking him again. Jiang Juan stopped hugging him and tried to go comb his hair, but Xue Fangli pulled him back, examining him for a moment before smiling and saying, "You look well in this."</p><p>The Board of Clothing not only made new clothes for Xue Fangli, but also for Jiang Juan.</p><p>—a red robe with bold yet not overly frivolous colors, the design somewhat loose, trailing on the ground. A bluebird was embroidered with gold thread at the back, intricately detailed to the extreme.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not feel well in it; he only felt heavy. He brushed Xue Fangli's hand away, "Open up, I need to comb my hair."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke carelessly, "Then you, Prince, comb it."</p><p>Jiang Juan subconsciously asked him, "Can you do it?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fangli tightened his grip on Jiang Juan's waist and smiled dangerously. He spoke slowly, "Forgot what you, Prince, said? If you can't speak, don't say anything."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, and she subconsciously licked her lips. Immediately, she corrected herself and sincerely said, "My lord, you did well, very well."</p><p>The youth's lips were slightly pale, but the tip of his tongue was a bright red. He lightly flicked it, coating his lips with moisture, yet he still looked up and said that he did very well.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head as if to kiss her, then remembered something and instead raised his hand, forcefully rubbing her lips. Xue Fangli's hoarse voice warned, "Don't provoke the lord today."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, "... I didn't, you quickly comb my hair."</p><p>Lanting hurriedly handed over a wooden comb. Jiang Juan sat down, and Xue Fangli combed out her long hair like a waterfall. He then took a red silk ribbon to tie up her hair.</p><p>"Done."</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was flat, but the next moment he glanced into the mirror and suddenly stopped moving.</p><p>The youth sat in front of the mirror, his hair black, skin fair, and a red robe trailing on the ground. Though slender, he managed to carry off the elaborate and intense attire, along with his lips that were both red and soft from being rubbed—like—</p><p>He was wearing a wedding gown, about to get married.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time. Jiang Juan curiously reached out a hand, grabbed his sleeve, and asked, "My lord, is something wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyes gently fell, "Xi..."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Xi what?"</p><p>"Getting married was too hasty, the lord hasn't seen you in a wedding gown."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "Is it okay?"</p><p>But Xue Fangli said thoughtfully, "Change, let's get remarried."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>It sounded troublesome, Jiang Juan shook her head vigorously. "Your Highness, if you want to see me wear my wedding dress, I'll wear it for you to look at, okay? Do we need to bow again?"</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>Xue Fangli leaned down, pinching Jiang Juan's chin and gently lifting his face. "Our marriage should not be too hasty, and it would have wronged you. After this matter is settled, Your Majesty will arrange a proper wedding for me."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>No, he really didn't need it, nor did he feel wronged.</p><p>Jiang Juan still found it troublesome, shaking his head again. However, Xue Fangli ignored it and picked Jiang Juan up, slowly walking out. His red lips curled slightly as he said with satisfaction, "Getting married to you twice isn't bad."</p><p>Jiang Juan was speechless.</p><p>The book didn't mention him getting married twice.</p><p>Was this considered a second marriage?</p><p>The ancestral worship ceremony was of great importance, with Emperor Hongxing personally attending along with the civil and military officials.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, Emperor Hongxing had already performed ancestral worship. This time, in addition to commemorating his recent affairs, many ministers were anxious.</p><p>——Your Majesty, it's time to establish a crown prince.</p><p>The emperor's favored candidate was obvious. The ministers were anxious, even angry.</p><p>With a sharp crash, the crystal lamp broke, and Concubine Mei received sixty lashes. Her body had not yet recovered from her convalescence. Despite this, she could still be petulant.</p><p>Seeing this, Scholar Zhouchua said anxiously, "Mother Consort, calm down. Take care of your health."</p><p>"Take care?" Concubine Mei ground her teeth and said, "He made the palace lose the Phoenix Seal and then received sixty lashes, only to become the crown prince in the end. How can Your Majesty expect me to calm down or take care of myself?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua frowned and said, "Mother Consort, my son has always remembered what you said—don't provoke the Fifth Prince. He is fearless and unyielding, yet you insist on provoking him..."</p><p>He was better off not speaking, but mentioning Mei Consort only made him angrier. He cursed, "No provocation? What a fine no provocation! You just know how to pacify things. Now he's going to be the Crown Prince, and what about you? You're still telling people in the palace not to provoke him. How could the palace have produced such a coward!"</p><p>Xue Chaohua was humiliated by the scolding, especially since it wasn't just Mei Consort present; his grandfather—Vice Chancellor Li—had entered the palace early that morning to visit his ill daughter.</p><p>"As for the Fifth Prince, we can't clash with him head-on. He's too reckless..."</p><p>"You—!"</p><p>Mei Consort's anger flared again. Chancellor Li had come here not to listen to their arguments; he frowned and interrupted, "Stop it."</p><p>"The First Prince is right. Your Excellency, this is not a matter of clashing head-on," said Chancellor Li. "Besides, why are you in such a hurry? The Emperor has yet to make his decision. Whether the Crown Prince will be made or not depends on the ancestors' wishes."</p><p>Mei Consort was taken aback. "Father's opinion is..."</p><p>Chancellor Li gave her a mysterious smile and didn't speak plainly. He vaguely added, "Moreover, that Crown Prince's consort also comes with issues."</p><p>"Her mother died in childbirth, and she was sent to the countryside to be raised by her grandfather there. How can such a grand Crown Princess Consort be illiterate and without manners? I've heard from Secretary Jiang that her son has not visited his parents' home since their wedding."</p><p>Chancellor Li spoke slowly, "When the late Emperor passed away, he entrusted the Emperor to Bai Xuechao. The Emperor respects and feels guilty towards Bai Xuechao. Mentioning someone else might not work, but mentioning Bai Xuechao will surely make him think."</p><p>"Bai Xuechao has always adhered to Confucian teachings and etiquette. If the Emperor likes Li Wang, wouldn't he also consider his consort?"</p><p>Mei Consort suddenly understood. "Father is right."</p><p>Xue Chaohua hesitated. "The Fifth Prince treats his consort very well. Would we be in trouble if we went after a soft target..."</p><p>Mei Consort said coldly, "If you don't act now, once he becomes the Crown Prince, he will no longer consider you his brother and keep embarrassing you every time, showing no respect at all. Do you really think you can get along well with him?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua was taken aback but recalled many past events. He gritted his teeth and said to Chancellor Li, "This time... I'll rely on Grandfather."</p><p>"Anshen jie, please bow to worship the gods—!"</p><p>The High Priest of the Imperial College shouted loudly. Emperor Hongxing emerged, followed by Xue Fangli and Jiang Juan. The officials bowed respectfully: "Long live our emperor—!"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled and said, "Stand up."</p><p>He stepped onto the altar, holding a fragrant stick of incense. Manager Wang stood beside him to light it, while Emperor Hongxing slowly spoke, "Today I come not only to worship our ancestors but also to solemnly announce to heaven and earth."</p><p>"I—declare Fangli as my Crown Prince!"</p><p>Though his guess was correct, when Emperor Hongxing announced it himself, the officials could not help being shaken in their hearts. They looked at Xue Fangli on the altar, each with different expressions, yet none dared to speak up to dissuade him.</p><p>Seeing this, Emperor Hongxing nodded in satisfaction, preparing to bow to heaven and his ancestors.</p><p>He then lifted his robe, only to find that the incense he was holding had been extinguished!</p><p>Emperor Hongxing frowned. Manager Wang saw this clearly and hurriedly lit it again, but the flame flickered and went out once more.</p><p>"Your Majesty…"</p><p>Manager Wang's lips turned pale; he instinctively knew something was wrong.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing's expression also darkened. He said in a low voice, "Get more incense sticks."</p><p>Manager Wang nodded and quickly fetched several more. The anomaly on the altar naturally caught everyone's attention below. Emperor Hongxing remained calm, waiting for Manager Wang to hand him the new incense sticks and light them again—</p><p>With a puff, the sparks flickered but went out once more.</p><p>"Your Majesty…"</p><p>In a hushed silence, Li Da opened his mouth. He was the Secretary of the Ministry of Punishments, Li Da. He glanced at Jiang Xuan and bit his lip before stepping forward to say, "The repeated extinguishing of the incense is an ominous sign!"</p><p>Jiang Xuan: "..."</p><p>He knew today would not go smoothly.</p><p>He had wanted to end it early and return home for a nap.</p><p>Jiang Xuan sighed. Sch Li Fangli turned his head to look at Jiang Xuan with an inquiring glance, but Jiang Xuan shook his head and idly grabbed Sch Li Fangli's hand, playing with it.</p><p>Sch Li Fangli glanced at him, allowing Jiang Xuan to play with his hand, without taking his eyes off of Li Da. However, Emperor Hongxing smiled after hearing this and asked, "An ominous sign? What do you mean by that?"</p><p>Li Da said, "In the past, whenever we paid homage to our ancestors, nothing like this has ever happened. Now that His Majesty has mentioned establishing a crown prince..."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled. "Li Da's meaning is—my chosen crown prince displeases my ancestors, so they are showing themselves?"</p><p>"Your Majesty, I do not mean that!"</p><p>Li Da hurriedly said, "I was just thinking that perhaps the Queen Consort is unsuitable."</p><p>Jiang Xuan: "?"</p><p>What does it have to do with him?</p><p>Jiang Xuan did not understand and was very puzzled. Li Da continued, "If Your Highness becomes the crown prince, then the Queen Consort will be the crown princess...the Queen Consort..."</p><p>"Your Majesty, throughout history, those who have become crown princesses, whether in terms of lineage or conduct, have all been outstanding."</p><p>Li Da: "The Queen Consort is indeed the third son of the Ministry of Personnel. However, he grew up in the countryside and was raised by his grandfather. A retired old family living in the countryside, how much can they understand? The Queen Consort spends her days with him, and her personality becomes even more unrestrained, adopting the habits of rural villagers."</p><p>"If I am not mistaken, not long ago, after the Queen Consort was brought back to the capital by Jiang Da, she even pushed her brother into a lake."</p><p>Duke Ling said earnestly, "Your Majesty, when it comes to lineage, the Empress Dowager's background is somewhat lacking. As for her character, it seems... not entirely upright. Given these circumstances, how can she be a Crown Princess? How could she gain the public's approval?"</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed derisively upon hearing this, "Duke Ling..."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing raised his hand to stop him from continuing and smiled, "Let me hear what he has to say."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him but did not insist. Instead, his eyes toward Duke Ling were filled with sarcasm.</p><p>After a brief pause, Emperor Hongxing asked again, "What is your view on Bairen Zhicao, Duke Ling?"</p><p>"Bairen is different."</p><p>Seeing that someone was about to bring up Bairen Zhicao, Duke Ling hurriedly said, "Mr. Bairen has noble character and integrity; he truly embodies an icy soul and snow-like spirit."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing nodded and asked him again, "Can Old Fifth's Empress Dowager be the Crown Princess? Duke Ling, can Bairen Zhicao's descendant be a Crown Princess?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>What is going on with the emperor?</p><p>We agreed to make her the Crown Princess. Based on His Highness' wealth and status, why does he need to find another Crown Princess now?</p><p>Jiang Juan was shocked and unhappy. Seeing this, Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan's hand firmly. Jiang Juan could not attack Emperor Hongxing but pinched Xue Fangli instead. Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched as he met her gaze.</p><p>There is no way he will remarry.</p><p>Jiang Juan pursed her lips.</p><p>"Your Majesty, that was not my intention."</p><p>Lord Li chuckled bitterly, "Your Majesty, you hold Mr. Bai in great esteem and must be well aware that, according to Mr. Bai, the more noble one is, the more they should understand and abide by etiquette, using it as a means of self-restraint."</p><p>"His Wang Fei... teaches these things."</p><p>Lord Li: "If the Wang Fei had grown up in the Ministry of Personnel, she would naturally know what to do and what not to do under the influence. However, he didn't. He became the Crown Princess Consort after all that. When his actions were more cautious as a result, Mr. Bai came to understand. How do you think he would feel now!"</p><p>Although Lord Li spoke so much, Emperor Hongxing did not get annoyed. He still asked, "Lord Li, what do you think? Could Bai Xuechao have done this Crown Princess Consort?"</p><p>Lord Li was taken aback, "Of course, she could. If it were Bai Xuechao's descendant, then both her lineage and conduct would undoubtedly be excellent."</p><p>"I agree with you as well."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing nodded before slowly saying, "How do you think Bai Xuechao feels about it?"</p><p>Speaking calmly, Emperor Hongxing said, "He arranged a marriage for his grandson, but fate intervened, and his grandson was rejected. Instead, the other party got married."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled slightly, "Knowing this matter, Bai Xuechao must be tossing and turning in anger."</p><p>"Great Lord Li, what bad luck."</p>
