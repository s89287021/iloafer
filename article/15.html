						<p>High Official Shi: "……"</p><p>After His Highness the Prince was said to be a good person, another saying emerged that he should not offend anyone.</p><p>High Official Shi's face crinkled again.</p><p>It was fine if the Princess Consort dared to speak, but how dare His Highness the Prince agree?</p><p>He was filled with resentment, yet Jiang Juan did not feel there was anything wrong with his words. Hearing His Highness the Prince agree so readily, Jiang Juan could not help asking in puzzlement, "Your Highness, you don't seem like a bad person at all; why do people in the capital say that about you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli pretended to be curious, "Hmm? What exactly do they say about this prince?"</p><p>To avoid hurting him, Jiang Juan carefully chose his words and only vaguely replied, "They say you are a bad person."</p><p>"Oh, I see," Xue Fangli said with disappointment, "Perhaps there are many misunderstandings about this prince."</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed; he agreed too. He sympathetically said, "It's okay, Your Highness. We all know that you are not like that."</p><p>His "we" included not only himself but also High Official Shi and others. After saying so, Jiang Juan looked at High Official Shi, indicating that he should also say something to comfort the Prince, as being misunderstood was a painful experience.</p><p>High Official Shi hesitated for half a moment before giving in. He said numbly, "Yes, Your Highness, we all know that you are not like that. What people outside say, you need not take it to heart."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled lightly, "This prince knows."</p><p>High Official Shi: "……"</p><p>Sigh, as the saying goes, money is hard to earn and sh*t is hard to swallow. For the sake of the young ladies in Red Sleeve Pavilion, he endured.</p><p>Secretary Jiang Shang and Jiang Nian had left. Jiang Juan felt that there was no need for Xue Fangli to continue hugging him, so he said, "Your Highness, they have left. There's no need to keep hugging me."</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Jiang Juan added, "Maybe I should go back to the other courtyard now?"</p><p>He didn't get enough rest and wanted to go back to take a nap. Lying on the beautified bed, he felt cramped, and Jiang Juan always felt like she would fall off. However, Xue Fangli ignored his words completely.</p><p>The young man sat in his arms, with a faint scent of medicinal herbs lingering around him. His mind was unusually calm for a long time. He didn't mind being so close to the youth; in fact, he—</p><p>was quite pleased.</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli finally spoke, but it was to Jiang Juan: "Eat your meal first."</p><p>Jiang Juan's stomach also growled. Between leaving the villa and having something to eat, he shamelessly chose to eat first. "Okay."</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Jiang Juan mentioned again, "Your Highness, I can sit on my own, really."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and stopped him: "Don't move around recklessly."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Was he a human pillow?</p><p>Jiang Juan felt awkward but didn't dare to struggle. He could only try to convince himself.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>The days of Your Highness are numbered, so what Your Highness says goes.</p><p>It's just a hug after all. Besides, his tenure as the concubine wouldn't last long anyway. Enduring for a while would get him through it.</p><p>Jiang Juan consoled himself, and Gao Shisheng had already begun preparations for the feast. The maids entered one after another, serving various appetizers and fruits first.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at them. He wanted to eat lychees. Before he could reach out, a maid quickly picked one, saying softly, "Concubine, I'll peel it for you."</p><p>Jiang Juan froze for a moment, before the maid swiftly peeled the fruit and fed it to him. He could only open his mouth and take a bite.</p><p>The translucent flesh was broken by his teeth, and the juice dripped out, sticking to Jiang Juan's lips, making them look glossy.</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to be a lazy person, but having food served directly to him felt too indulgent. He didn't quite get used to being attended to during meals, so he shook his head and said to the maid, "I can do it myself, you don't have to—"</p><p>He had spoken too late. The maid had already peeled another lychee and hesitated for a moment upon hearing him, not sure whether to put it down or not.</p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Juan could only eat this one as well and said, "You don't need to bother with me; I can manage."</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed uninterested in the things on the table, focusing instead on Jiang Juan's lips for a long time. When the maid was about to feed him another lychee, he calmly said, "This one is not sweet, have this one instead."</p><p>He also picked a lychee, elegantly peeled it, and raised his hand to offer it to Jiang Juan.</p><p>When Guo Shangshi saw this from the side, he was utterly stunned.</p><p>They all looked identical, how did Young Master know which wasn't sweet?</p><p>Of course, what shocked Guo Shangshi even more was that their Young Master was willing to serve someone during meals.</p><p>This had never happened before.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't know what Guo Shangshi was thinking, but he too was conflicted—he was injured in his foot, not his hand, so there was no need for feeding. However, since Xue Fangli had already brought it over, out of social courtesy, Jiang Juan opened his mouth.</p><p>The lychee's flesh was crystal clear and translucent, wetting Jiang Juan's lips, which were originally slightly pale but now glistened with water droplets, looking moisturized.</p><p>His lips seemed inexplicably more tempting than the lychee itself, softer and sweeter.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and when Jiang Juan bit into the whole lychee, he didn't retract his hand. Instead, he seemingly casually touched Jiang Juan's lips with his fingertips, repeatedly gliding over a certain spot.</p><p>Really soft.</p><p>I just don't know what the taste is like.</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled. He couldn't even bite into the lychee, which bulged in his cheeks. He looked at Xue Fangli and asked curiously, "Your Highness, what's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "It's sticky with juice."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "oh," without giving it much thought. However, he subconsciously wanted to lick his lips, only to suddenly feel something with the tip of his tongue. Jiang Juan's eyes widened abruptly.</p><p>Xue Fangli also froze for a moment.</p><p>The soft tip of his tongue brushed against his fingertip, giving him a moist and warm sensation, so soft that it made him itch inside.</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't say anything and retracted his hand as usual. However, Jiang Juan felt like he was dying from embarrassment. He mentally added lychee to his blacklist. Just when he had finished eating it, Xue Fangli sent another one over.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Eat."</p><p>No way, he couldn't take it anymore. Jiang Juan tried to remind him, "Your Highness, my hand is fine, I don't need you to feed me."</p><p>"Hmm," Xue Fangli nodded but didn't take his words to heart, "Just eat this one."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>They looked at each other. Jiang Juan eventually gave in and slowly bit into it, unsure of how to express that he really didn't need to be fed.</p><p>Almost an entire tray of lychees was fed to Jiang Juan by Xue Fangli. When his finger probed the empty tray, Xue Fangli sighed softly, looking somewhat regretful.</p><p>He asked Jiang Juan, "How were the lychees?"</p><p>Jiang Juan answered happily, "So sweet."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at GaoGuan Shi, who immediately understood and said, "This slave will send more from Nanjiang right away."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a "hum."</p><p>Jiang Juan had eaten quite a few lychees. Once the banquet was set up, the dishes were plentiful and delicious, but he only ate a few bites before feeling full.</p><p>After eating his fill, Jiang Juan just wanted to take a nap. He then told Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, I want to go back to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually replied, "Sleep here."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "The bed is too narrow; I'm afraid of falling off."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Then sleep in the bed."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Juan shook his head even more vigorously. If he slept on the bed, Xue Fangli would definitely not stay on the couch; they would have to share a bed. Jiang Juan did not like sharing beds with others and insisted, "I'll go back to sleep."</p><p>"Last night you didn't seem to get much sleep either..."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids without responding. After waiting for a little while, when he realized that Xue Fangli was conceding, Jiang Juan removed the hand that Xue Fangli had placed on his waist and distanced himself from him.</p><p>In that moment, his embrace felt empty, the sweet scent faded, and those suppressed irritations and savagery surged back into his heart. Xue Fangli closed his eyes.</p><p>He did not really want to let Jiang Juan go.</p><p>But he was a "good person."</p><p>Lanting had a girl, but Jiang Juan could not rely on her to carry him back, so he casually pointed at a guard and asked, "Can you take me back to the banyuan?"</p><p>The guard could take him, but without Xue Fangli's permission, he dared not leave on his own. He sought Xue Fangli's approval, "Your Highness, may this humble servant escort Lady Wang back to the banyuan?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said calmly, "Mm, send him away."</p><p>The guards obeyed and carried Jiang Juan on their backs, while Lanting followed closely behind. The entire time, a pair of eyes was fixed on Jiang Juan, but he remained unaware.</p><p>It wasn’t until the door closed that Xue Fangli reluctantly withdrew his gaze.</p><p>Inside the pavilion, only the maidservants stood at attention, and everything around was quiet and desolate.</p><p>The feast was bountiful, yet Jiang Juan had barely eaten a few bites. Xue Fangli hadn’t touched his chopsticks much either. He glanced over it but still had no appetite. He said in a faint voice, "Take it away."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The maidservants immediately sprang into action. Xue Fangli remained restless throughout. He then said, "Light the incense."</p><p>Not long after, a familiar fragrance filled the air. It was a scent he had grown accustomed to, but at this moment, it only felt unsatisfactory.</p><p>The smell was too strong and too chaotic.</p><p>Xue Fangli had relied on these scents through countless nights and days, yet he did not want them to soothe his restlessness anymore. He could not even find a moment of peace from them.</p><p>A fierce impulse emanated from his soul, and the deep-seated agitation tormented him. Xue Fangli wearily lifted his hand and hooked out an incense bag from his sleeve.</p><p>A crimson red incense bag.</p><p>It was what Jiang Juan had given him last night.</p><p>Xue Fangli picked up the incense bag and took a whiff. The youthful aroma had long faded, leaving only the original scent of the incense bag—mixtures of white peonies, orchids, and Cassia seeds.</p><p>Still chaotic.</p><p>He clenched the incense bag expressionlessly, suddenly unable to understand why he was being a good person or why he wanted to be one.</p><p>Absurd and laughable.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the executive director finished his work and quietly pushed open the door. He was startled when he suddenly met a pair of bloodshot eyes. It took him a long while to stammer out, "Y-your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli toyed with the sachet in his hand, speaking in a teasing tone: "Go to the other courtyard."</p><p>"Tell the Consort that yesterday's sachet was lost and ask for another one."</p>
