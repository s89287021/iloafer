						<p>Deng Jun, that little bitch was just getting dressed up. You can use your formidable purchasing power to get rid of her.</p><p>"Jiang Juan, whether you want it or not, the person we sent from our Shangshu Mansion into Li Mansion is you," said the middle-aged man in official attire with a look of disgust. "Don't forget that it was you who pushed Xiaonian into the lake."</p><p>Li Mansion? Xiaonian? What is he talking about?</p><p>The more Jiang Juan listened, the unease in his heart grew.</p><p>After pausing for a moment, the middle-aged man glanced at the crying maid and then said to him, "As long as you honestly marry into Li Mansion, everything between you and Xiaonian will be erased from now on."</p><p>His tone was contemptuous, and his posture was high and mighty, as if granting Jiang Juan permission to marry into Li Mansion was a great favor.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He seems to have figured it out.</p><p>Isn't this the novel "After Reincarnation, I Became Everyone's Favorite" that my cousin shared with me last night?</p><p>At that time, he was about to be taken to the operating table for a heart repair surgery with only a 10% success rate. While Jiang Juan said he would take a chance and turn his bicycle into a motorcycle, he was still nervous in reality. He tossed and turned all night, and his cousin, who was accompanying him, said, "Hey, brother, I read a novel where a cannon fodder character has the same name as you. Do you want to check it out together?"</p><p>Since he couldn't sleep anyway, Jiang Juan asked his cousin for the address. The cannon fodder character had already accumulated hatred in the first chapter, and Jiang Juan said, "Should I memorize the entire book now to prepare for reincarnation tomorrow?"</p><p>His cousin laughed continuously, and Jiang Juan flipped through a few more chapters.</p><p>"After Reincarnation, I Became Everyone's Favorite" is an eroge fanfiction. At the start of the story, the male protagonist reincarnates after being spoiled in his previous life when he was favored by Duke Pingan. However, the male protagonist didn't care about it. Later, he was assigned to Li Wang and died unhappily, while Duke Pingan became an emperor due to political turmoil.</p><p>Starting over, the male protagonist made a great effort to change the plot and gradually won over his father, the Shangshu of the Ministry of Rites, his classmate who came from a wealthy family background, and even a prince, becoming everyone's favorite and top favorite.</p><p>This time, the male protagonist accepted Duke Pingan's confession and decided to take a different path.</p><p>This male protagonist is named Jiang Nian, also known as Xiaonian.</p><p>Regarding the cannon fodder who shares the same name and surname as Jiang Juan, the Marquis of Anping once had an unwed fiancé, who was this man.</p><p>The main character refused to marry Prince Li. Therefore, someone else must take his place. In the original text, Jiang Juan's fiancé demanded to annul their engagement at this time, causing the main character to be pushed into the lake in a fit of anger. Thus, it fell upon him, this unfortunate fellow, to redeem himself through meritorious service.</p><p>Jiang Juan thought deeply, her eyelashes lowered, exuding a sense of obedience.</p><p>Secretary Jiang was taken aback and then frowned.</p><p>This Jiang Juan appears honest, but her thoughts are exceedingly malicious.</p><p>Secretary Jiang had always disapproved of his son. His birth mother passed away early, and he grew up in the countryside, raised by his grandfather. He was timid and unsuitable for social occasions. If not for his severe heart disease requiring medical treatment, Secretary Jiang would never have brought him back to the capital. This son only brought disgrace upon him.</p><p>With that, a jade pendant was hurled at Jiang Juan, and Secretary Jiang continued.</p><p>"—You and Jiang Nian are worlds apart. The engagement has been annulled, so there is no need to keep the jade pendant. Take care of yourself.”</p><p>As the jade pendant was about to hit the ground, Jiang Juan hurriedly pressed it against her chest, desperately intercepting it—divorce is divorce, but the jade pendant is innocent; such a beautiful water-clear jade is too precious to destroy.</p><p>Secretary Jiang mistakenly believed she had not given up and warned her again, "Jiang Juan, regardless of the jade pendant, you are now Princess Consort of Li. Do not pester Marquis of Anping anymore."</p><p>Jiang Juan was preoccupied with examining the jade pendant. Seeing her grip it silently, Secretary Jiang inquired, "Jiang Juan, do you have any complaints?"</p><p>White as a jade pendant, she naturally had no complaints. However, for the character Jiang Juan in the book, there were too many grievances.</p><p>Apart from wondering what would happen to Marquis of Anping afterward, rumors in the palace suggested that this Prince Li, despite being ill, was cruel, capricious, and absurdly eccentric, even personally killing his stepmother!</p><p>Furthermore, in the book, Jiang Juan came to the capital precisely because of her engagement to Marquis of Anping. She held this fiancé in high regard. To this end, Jiang Juan did not hesitate to feign illness and travel far to the capital.</p><p>Yes, she did not actually have a heart disease; at most, it was just a minor congenital deficiency, nowhere near severe enough to require treatment in the capital.</p><p>According to the plot, overwhelmed by his fear of King Li and further devastated by Duke Ping's cancellation of their wedding, and having heard those heart-wrenching words, Jiang Juan, in a state of despair, bit her tongue to death.</p><p>However, he did not know that King Li passed away the day after their intended wedding.</p><p>This was still the protagonist living out the plot from his previous life. Without the king, the protagonist enjoyed daily freedom. The nobles in the palace, remembering that she had married in for good luck, treated her kindly despite having no achievements to speak of. However, the protagonist did not like this carefree life and was constantly miserable, which eventually led to her illness and a chance at rebirth.</p><p>When Jiang Juan read this part, she found it absurd and directed a soul-searching question at her cousin: "How can anyone not want to be a dried fish?"</p><p>Her cousin replied, "As a protagonist, one must have ambitions. How can they just be good for nothing!"</p><p>Jiang Juan sincerely said, "If I were to enter this book, I would simply follow the plot and wait until King Li dies. Then, I would be the saltiest fish, living like a deity."</p><p>And then...</p><p>Now he was really in the book.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into deep thought.</p><p>"Sir Jiang, Sir Jiang—!" The matchmaker hurried over, her face radiant with joy. "It is time for the auspicious hour; Third Young Master must head to King Li's residence."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan suddenly raised her eyes, her gaze startlingly bright. Seeing her expression, the matchmaker was taken aback.</p><p>The youth had an exceptionally handsome appearance. Even in his plain clothes, none of his charm was hidden. Perhaps due to the earlier tug, most of his hair fell over his shoulders. His skin was unnaturally pale, and his lips were almost colorless, making him look even more frail as if he would scatter with a light breeze.</p><p>It was said that Third Young Master of the Shangshu Mansion came from the countryside, carrying all the characteristics of a simple villager. However, seeing him today, how could one have imagined such... otherworldly beauty?</p><p>Could it be that this divine young master pushed Second Young Master into the lake?</p><p>The matchmaker couldn't help but wonder inwardly. Not only her, even Secretary Jiang seemed somewhat stunned, finding Jiang Juan's eyes unusually clear and different from her usual gloominess.</p><p>But he did not give it much thought, merely snorting coldly, "What? You have something to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled to grab his sleeves and finally said the first sentence since entering the book: "Hurry, help me up; don't miss the auspicious time."</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "???"</p><p>He lifted his sleeves, took a step back as if Jiang Juan were some filthy thing, wanting to avoid her at all costs. Jiang Shushu thought he was still reeling from the impact and had started babbling, so he unconcernedly said, "Men, take Third Young Master upstairs in the palanquin."</p><p>March 21st, auspicious for marriage.</p><p>The flower palanquin jolted along as Jiang Juan sat inside, desperately trying to recall the relevant plot points.</p><p>This Li Wang was described very little in the book; besides being a sickly man, he was also characterized by two words.</p><p>Disregard for ethics, tyrannical and capricious.</p><p>As for this wedding, the Jiang Juan in the text had already bitten his tongue to death before reaching there. The main character, however, had some recollections from before her reincarnation.</p><p>—"Li Wang is an unfathomable man; he is terrifying and more so, panic-inducing. Jiang Nian remembered bowing her head as soon as she stepped out of the palanquin, not daring to look around at all. The journey was full of trepidation, but even more frighteningly, he fell ill halfway through. Jiang Nian witnessed Li Wang killing many servants, blood flowing like a river."</p><p>It seemed quite terrifying.</p><p>Jiang Juan gave herself some encouragement in her heart.</p><p>There is no difficult job, only brave dogs.</p><p>No big problem, she wouldn't survive past three chapters, but Jiang Juan could.</p><p>"Newlyweds arrive——!"</p><p>Jiang Juan's face turned pale—out of fright. He instinctively raised his head, only to be met with several "whoosh" sounds as two arrows shot towards him. All Jiang Juan could think about was:</p><p>There are troublemakers trying to ambush me!</p><p>In his panic, he locked eyes with a pair of smiling eyes.</p><p>The man was slender and upright, like bamboo or crane. His skin was pale, yet his lips were an intense red. Dressed in a black-gold robe, colors that would normally exude extravagance, his demeanor was elegant, suppressing the flamboyancy to instead appear noble beyond compare.</p><p>His identity was clear at a glance.</p><p>Duke Li, Xue Fangli.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan looking at him, Xue Fangli nonchalantly nodded in greeting, drew back the bowstring, and released it, shooting another arrow towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Whoosh—!"</p><p>"Duke, that's enough, enough!" whispered the estate manager, "Three arrows settle everything; three arrows are sufficient."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped his actions, handed over the bow and arrows to the manager, and slowly approached Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan stood there dumbfounded.</p><p>This was Duke Li?</p><p>The Duke Li who disregarded human morality and acted tyrannically at will?</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli sincerely added, "Third Young Master, I overstepped myself."</p><p>Jiang Juan stood rooted to the spot as the long arrow barely brushed past his earlobe, severing a lock of hair that it pinned to the palanquin behind him.</p><p>Jiang Juan's face turned pale with fear. He instinctively raised his head and was met with several "whoosh" sounds as two more arrows flew towards him. All Jiang Juan could think about in that moment was:</p><p>There are troublemakers trying to ambush me!</p><p>In his panic, he locked eyes with a pair of smiling eyes.</p><p>The man was slender and upright, like bamboo or crane. His pale skin contrasted with his intensely red lips. Dressed in a black-gold robe, colors that usually exuded extravagance, his demeanor was elegantly restrained, suppressing the flamboyancy to instead appear nobly regal.</p><p>His identity was clear at a glance.</p><p>Duke Li, Xue Fangli.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan looking at him, Xue Fangli casually nodded in greeting, drew back the bowstring, and released it, shooting another arrow towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Whoosh—!"</p><p>"Duke, enough is enough!" whispered the estate manager, "Three arrows are sufficient to settle everything."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped his actions, handed over the bow and arrows to the manager, and slowly approached Jiang Juan.</p><p>"I heard that a new arrival should shoot arrows at the flower palanquin to drive away evil spirits. However, I haven't practiced archery in a long time, so that arrow missed its mark," Xue Fangli said gently, "Did it scare you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan stood there dumbfounded.</p><p>This was Duke Li?</p><p>The same Duke Li who disregarded human morality and acted tyrannically at will?</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli sincerely added, "Third Young Master, I overstepped myself."</p><p>Jiang Juan froze as the long arrow barely brushed his earlobe, severing a lock of hair that it pinned to the palanquin behind him.</p><p>His face turned pale with fear. He instinctively raised his head only to be met with several "whoosh" sounds as two more arrows flew towards him. All Jiang Juan could think in that moment was:</p><p>There are troublemakers trying to ambush me!</p><p>In his panic, he locked eyes with a pair of smiling eyes.</p><p>The man stood slender and upright, like bamboo or crane. His pale skin contrasted sharply with his intensely red lips. Dressed in a black-gold robe, colors that usually exuded extravagance, his demeanor was elegantly restrained, suppressing the flamboyancy to instead appear nobly regal.</p><p>His identity was clear at a glance.</p><p>Duke Li, Xue Fangli.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan looking at him, Xue Fangli casually nodded in greeting, drew back the bowstring, and released it, shooting another arrow towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Whoosh—!"</p><p>"Duke, enough is enough!" whispered the estate manager, "Three arrows are sufficient to settle everything."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped his actions, handed over the bow and arrows to the manager, and slowly approached Jiang Juan.</p><p>"I heard that a new arrival should shoot arrows at the flower palanquin to drive away evil spirits. However, I haven't practiced archery in a long time, so that arrow missed its mark," Xue Fangli said gently, "Did it scare you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan stood there dumbfounded.</p><p>This was Duke Li?</p><p>The same Duke Li who disregarded human morality and acted tyrannically at will?</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli sincerely added, "Third Young Master, I overstepped myself."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>After a long while, Jiang Juan slowly shook his head, "Ah, nothing."</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli still looked apologetic, "It's good that Third Young Master is fine. I just remembered that Third Young Master has heart disease and cannot withstand scares; we should have informed him in advance."</p><p>Having said that, he smiled, appearing as noble and elegant as a phoenix among the clouds and orchids among jade trees.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Was there something wrong?</p><p>Jiang Juan did not speak, his expression filled with confusion. Xue Fangli then spoke slowly, "Speaking of which, I heard that Third Young Master's marriage into Li Family was not out of volition. If you truly do not wish..."</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately snapped back to reality and hurriedly replied, "I don't have any unwillingness! I volunteered!"</p><p>He really did volunteer to be a mere fish, more genuine than pearls!</p><p>Xue Fangli was taken aback, looking down at him. The young man's tone was firm, his eyes bright with excitement and anticipation.</p><p>Excitement and anticipation?</p><p>Was this Third Young Master of the Ministry of Revenue not afraid of him?</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow slightly.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli extended his hand toward Jiang Juan with a half-smile, "Third Young Master, then let's proceed with the ceremony."</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyes were filled with concern, and his expression did not seem fake. The high official, seeing this, only smiled vaguely, "Something unexpected happened."</p><p>Having served the Prince for so many years, he had become quite skilled at reading people's expressions. This Second Young Master seemed genuinely concerned on the surface, but there was not a bit of true concern in it.</p><p>However...</p><p>Is not the Second Young Master of the Ministry of Works considered the top beauty in the capital?</p><p>High Official Shi examined him silently a few times, noting that he had clear brows and bright eyes. However, when compared to their Wangfei, he seemed like an insult to her beauty.</p><p>Isn't "heavenly maiden" an insult to a person, and isn't "beauty" also an insult to a person?</p><p>High Official Shi was indeed malicious, but his expression did not show it. When Jiang Nian heard his words, she hesitated for a moment and asked, "... Could it be because Brother is inexperienced and offended the Prince?"</p><p>Ji Wang's temper was well-known to Jiang Nian. As soon as Secretary Jiang mentioned that Jiang Juan had been injured, his first thought was that Ji Wang was responsible. Moreover, High Official Shi seemed very evasive about this matter.</p><p>In a previous life, Ji Wang treated him in the same way, nearly killing him with this man.</p><p>Jiang Nian paused and said guiltily, "Brother has been sick in the countryside since childhood and was only brought back to the capital recently. He is inexperienced with many things and did not mean to offend the Prince."</p><p>High Official Shi: "?"</p><p>Why is this about our Prince?</p><p>The Wangfei's injury had nothing to do with the Prince.</p><p>Putting aside how the Prince treated the Wangfei, who was already very indulged, this time she even saved the Prince's life. No matter how tyrannical the Prince was, he would not repay kindness with enmity.</p><p>High Official Shi helplessly said, "Second Young Master is overly worried."</p><p>Jiang Nian merely smiled, still believing that Jiang Juan had been injured by Ji Wang.</p><p>Perhaps Ji Wang's fate had changed, but a person's character could not be altered. Ji Wang was simply such a person.</p><p>Tyrannical, cunning, unpredictable in mood.</p><p>In his previous life, Jiang Nian endured day and night with anxiety and fear.</p><p>This life, Jiang Juan also endured day and night with anxiety and fear.</p><p>Jiang Nian picked up the teacup and took a light sip of tea.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>The servant who reported back did not return for a long time. With some impatience toward Secretary Jiang, the high-ranking official said, "Sir Jiang and Second Son, please sit for a moment longer while I go to check."</p><p>Secretary Jiang had other matters to attend to later and urged, "Hurry up."</p><p>As a result, the high-ranking official did not return.</p><p>"What nonsense!"</p><p>After about an hour of being ignored, Secretary Jiang could no longer hold it in. He slammed his teacup onto the table and said angrily, "How can it be reasonable for my son to make me wait? Coming with good intentions, he gives us a cold shoulder."</p><p>Jiang Nian also thought that Jiang Juan was overdoing it. He frowned but still tried to calm Secretary Jiang, "Father, don't be angry. Perhaps there's something that has delayed him."</p><p>Secretary Jiang snorted, "I think his feathers are getting too full!"</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan was quite innocent; he really had no ill intentions. Leaving Secretary Jiang and Jiang Nian waiting was not what he meant to do.</p><p>He only fell back asleep when the sky turned light again. When the servant reported for the first time, Jiang Juan did not hear what was said clearly and mumbled, "I want to sleep."</p><p>The servant hesitated and looked at Xue Fangli. Xue Fangli casually replied, "Let them wait."</p><p>After being woken up once, it was hard to fall asleep again comfortably. Jiang Juan woke up, went back to sleep, woke up again, repeated this a few times, and finally sat up from the bed of beauty.</p><p>"Is there something?"</p><p>Jiang Juan vaguely recalled someone saying something to him. He asked groggily, having not slept all night, his entire body feeling lethargic.</p><p>Just then, Gao Jianshi returned to wait. Seeing that he was awake, he said with a smile, "Lord Jiang and Young Master Number Two have come to see you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Who?"</p><p>Gao Jianshi repeated again, "Lord Jiang and Young Master Number Two are waiting for you now."</p><p>That must be the protagonist's sidekick.</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent for a while, hugging the thin blanket pitifully and helplessly. He asked Gao Jianshi, "How long have they been waiting?"</p><p>"About one hour."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>One hour.</p><p>Did he offend the protagonist's sidekick again after pushing someone into the lake?</p><p>Desperately, Jiang Juan asked, "Why didn't you wake me up completely?"</p><p>Gao Jianshi glanced at Xue Fangli. Seeing this, Jiang Juan turned around curiously. The man had taken the bed and was leaning against it, reading an ancient book. Without lifting his head, he said, "There's no need."</p>
