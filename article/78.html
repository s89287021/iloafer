						<p>Anping Marquis stiffened.</p><p>He slowly lifted his head. Xue Fangli's expression was cold, as if covered by a thin layer of ice, chilling to the bone. Anping Marquis' pent-up resentment and anger were drained in an instant, leaving him feeling like he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>Duke Li said what he did and did it thoroughly.</p><p>Thinking about this, Anping Marquis' face turned grim, his heart filled with only fear.</p><p>"Your Highness."</p><p>Since Anping Marquis lost control, Su Feiyue stayed out of the matter, watching him coldly as if observing a play unrelated to himself. It wasn't until Xue Fangli was about to take his life that Su Feiyue finally spoke up.</p><p>"It's my fault and Fu Ying's. We didn't teach him well."</p><p>Su Feiyue frowned and struggled to say, "He did indeed offend many, but..."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked coldly, "Are you pleading for him?"</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled bitterly, "No matter how disappointed he makes me, he is still my nephew."</p><p>It was clear that Su Feiyue wanted to save Anping Marquis. Helplessly, he said, "Your Highness, give me and Fu Ying a little face. We will definitely give you an explanation for today's events."</p><p>Su Feiyue spoke sincerely, but Xue Fangli scoffed, "An explanation to the King?"</p><p>"What kind of explanation does the King need from others?"</p><p>Xue Fangli remained unmoved, not even lifting his eyelids. He said indifferently, "Bring him! Take his life for the King!"</p><p>The guards obeyed and approached Anping Marquis. They drew their swords from their waists, a flash of cold light passing by. Anping Marquis was filled with fear, "Uncle!"</p><p>No matter how disappointed he was, Su Feiyue could not watch him die at the sword's edge today. In desperation, Su Feiyue said, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Su Feiyue glanced at Jiang Juan and reminded him, "Do not scare the Princess."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan. He did not care about the Marquis of Chai or the Princess; he did not want to give them any face either, but he could not afford to ignore Jiang Juan.</p><p>—He could not take away the life of the Marquis of Anping in front of Jiang Juan.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Xue Fangli finally spoke, his voice irritable. "Marquis of Chai, remember what you said; the King wants an explanation."</p><p>Su Feiyue heaved a sigh of relief and said, "Yes, I and Fu Ying will definitely make the Prince satisfied."</p><p>Xue Fangli's face was slightly mocking as he said, "Throw them out."</p><p>This move was disrespectful and almost tore their relationship apart. However, Su Feiyue thanked him with a bow, saying, "Thank you, Your Excellency, for sparing their lives this time."</p><p>But Xue Fangli did not care anymore. The guards began to drive away the Marquis of Chai and the Marquis of Anping. Xue Fangli's eyelids did not even twitch as he slowly spoke again, "Marquis of Anping, you were lucky this time. If there is a next time—"</p><p>With Jiang Juan present, Xue Fangli did not finish his sentence, but his anger was evident. If there was another time, the fate of the Marquis of Anping would be clear.</p><p>"Your Excellency, rest assured; there will not be a next time."</p><p>Having narrowly escaped death, the Marquis of Anping's limbs were still cold. His lips moved for a long time but no words came out. It was Su Feiyue who made the guarantee on his behalf.</p><p>The guards pushed them away forcefully. With a slam, the door to the Prince's Mansion closed, and they were driven out. Su Feiyue turned back, his expression complex.</p><p>"Uncle…"</p><p>The Marquis of Anping closed his eyes and mumbled softly.</p><p>This was the first time he had been driven away, like a rat on the street. His uncle must have also experienced such treatment for the first time; the Marquis of Anping felt even more uneasy.</p><p>Sufei Yue did not look at him; she simply asked in a bland tone, "Do you know why I sent you to apologize?"</p><p>Duke Ping of An said in a low voice, "The matter of the engagement was my fault. I should have apologized to the... Princess."</p><p>"Not just that."</p><p>Sufei Yue stood with her hands behind her back, "Zhaoshi, I originally thought you were intelligent, but I never expected you to be so foolish."</p><p>He slowly turned around, his eyes filled with disappointment, and his voice carried a hint of regret, "What a good hand I dealt you, yet you ended up like this."</p><p>Sufei Yue's words made no sense, leaving Duke Ping of An bewildered. He asked, "...Why does my uncle say this?"</p><p>Sufei Yue smiled, "Forget it. Since you did not argue and unilaterally broke off the engagement without gaining the Princess’s forgiveness, I might as well explain clearly to you so that you will remember for a long time."</p><p>"Don't you think about how your marriage was carefully arranged by me and Fu Ying?"</p><p>Sufei Yue sighed, "Do you really think I arranged this engagement just because his grandfather once saved my life?"</p><p>"I originally thought you could guess something, but it turns out you know nothing. This engagement was obtained for you by me and Fu Ying. We spent so much effort and heart to connect you two, yet you simply handed yourself over to King Li."</p><p>"Zhaoshi, you lost more than just an engagement."</p><p>He said this, and Duke Ping of An suddenly had a guess, his heart pounding wildly.</p><p>Sufei Yue sighed deeply, "It is true that the Princess's grandfather resides in the countryside, but he is not an ordinary man. He..."</p><p>Sufei Yue recited a name. After hearing it, Duke Ping of An felt as if struck by lightning and froze on the spot.</p><p>Sufei Yue sighed again, "Truly, when fate favors us, we must receive it; when fate does not favor us, we should not force it."</p><p>He and Xue Fu Ying had cared for Duke Ping of An wholeheartedly over the years, believing they had treated him generously. The strangeness of this engagement never occurred to him, leaving Sufei Yue feeling helpless between laughter and tears.</p><p>He shook his head and Su Feiyue was about to leave when the Marquis of Anping strode forward, "Uncle, is this... true?"</p><p>"You must be joking with me, Uncle?"</p><p>The Marquis of Anping couldn't believe it and certainly didn't want to accept it, "How could it? How could his grandfather possibly be this old man? There's no similarity between him and his grandfather at all. He..."</p><p>After that, the Marquis of Anping's eyes turned bloodshot, appearing both remorseful and resentful, "Uncle, say something! Quickly tell me you're just teasing me!"</p><p>Su Feiyue said nothing, only staring at him silently; everything was already understood without words.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>How could it possibly be like this?</p><p>"How could it? How could it be like this? Uncle, why did you and Aunt conceal this from me? Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p><p>Su Feiyue asked him calmly, "I didn't talk to Fu Ying because I promised not to. You insisted on calling off the engagement and getting engaged to Second Young Master; didn't we try to dissuade you?"</p><p>"You called off the engagement yourself, now you're blaming me and Aunt for not telling you earlier. Anyway, you're not young anymore. The decision was yours, whether right or wrong, it should be borne by you alone. You can't blame others."</p><p>The Marquis of Anping took a few steps back, realizing what he had lost and what he had given away; he only felt overwhelming regret, with immense sorrow threatening to crush him. Unable to relieve himself, almost driven mad, he cried and laughed, shouting loudly.</p><p>He had just been released from prison, disheveled and miserable, now appearing deranged, attracting the attention of passersby. Soon, news spread throughout the capital.</p><p>——The Marquis of Anping is mad!</p><p>Away from the Wang Residence.</p><p>After chasing away Su Feiyue and the Marquis of Anping, Jiang Juan finally stopped shaking.</p><p>"I'm so embarrassed."</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled, "I only know how to give birth, not how to teach others."</p><p>Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan's hand and gently massaged his red fingertips. "Didn't I slap him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. "It wasn't enough; he should have gotten another slap."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, then raised her rosy lips in a silent smile. "Lady truly showed her might when she fought with others."</p><p>Though impressive, his fingers still hurt. Jiang Juan lowered his eyes to look at the hand being held and his eyelashes drooped slightly, his gaze becoming somewhat dull.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke coolly, "What's wrong?"</p><p>After a long hesitation, Jiang Juan asked softly, "Your Highness, did you really do those things that Duke Hou said?"</p><p>Without wind there is no wave, but perhaps it was just hearsay. Jiang Juan trusted His Highness, yet at this moment he felt inexplicably uneasy and wanted to confirm.</p><p>Xue Fangli paused his finger movements, lowered her head, and a dark shadow flashed across her eyes momentarily. However, her voice remained gentle. "What do you think?"</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli asked again, "Do you believe him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan explained, "No, I just want to hear it from Your Highness."</p><p>He looked up with clear and clean eyes. "Seeing is believing, but there are too many rumors about you, Your Highness. I don't believe Duke Anping, I only believe in you."</p><p>Usually it was Xue Fangli who held Jiang Juan close, but this time it was Jiang Juan who wrapped his arms around Xue Fangli, pressing his forehead to her chest. Jiang Juan said softly, "Your Highness, just tell me."</p><p>Tell him.</p><p>What should he tell him?</p><p>That he was a madman and lost control when frenzied?</p><p>He was truly intent on taking the life of Marquis Anping. Those things… did he really do them? He enjoyed bringing up and probing Jiang Juan’s reactions to things he had never done before, relishing watching Jiang Juan struggle for him and admiring how full of compassion Jiang Juan was toward him.</p><p>These things… I have done them.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not immediately respond. Jiang Juan waited for a while, raised his head in confusion, and urged Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, why aren’t you speaking?"</p><p>"Y-Your H…"</p><p>Xue Fangli slowly began to speak but then suddenly remembered how Jiang Juan had flickered his eyelashes, hesitating to say something when he was in his arms. Xue Fangli’s tone changed as he casually asked Jiang Juan, "What were you thinking just now?"</p><p>"W-Why did Your Highness… want to take Marquis Anping’s life."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned and answered honestly, "At that time, Your Highness scared me so much, but…"</p><p>Xue Fangli’s eyes turned dark. "But what?"</p><p>Jiang Juan smiled at him, his eyes also gently crinkling. "I just guessed that you were only scaring him. Marquis is too annoying and talks too much; he should be properly frightened to prevent him from always talking nonsense."</p><p>No.</p><p>It wasn’t about scaring him.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes slightly. After a long while, he said calmly, "Since you believe in Your Highness, why ask?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, “Ah?”</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and sat down expressionlessly as Jiang Juan watched him, biting his lip.</p><p>The Prince seemed to be upset.</p><p>He shouldn't have asked so much.</p><p>Jiang Juan regretted not falling down.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Jiang Juan cautiously called out, but Xue Fangli merely lifted his eyelids, a distant and cold expression on his face, without giving him any response.</p><p>"Are you upset?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked anxiously, but realized it was a pointless question immediately, for otherwise the Prince would have already pulled him into his arms long ago.</p><p>Sure enough, Xue Fangli made no reply. Jiang Juan sighed, thinking hard before saying, "Prince, just now Duke Pingan annoyed me and I didn't want to worry you, so I didn't tell you."</p><p>"My heart hurts a lot."</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended to press on his chest, his eyebrows slightly furrowing, the pain appearing genuine as he muttered drowsily, "Can you hug me and rub my back?"</p><p>The young man had just been through that ordeal, trembling all over, naturally feeling uncomfortable. Xue Fangli looked at him for a moment before reaching out to scoop Jiang Juan into his arms.</p><p>Xue Fangli's hand loosely rested on Jiang Juan's waist as if genuinely concerned about its delicate fragility, unable to bear any force.</p><p>Jiang Juan held back but couldn't suppress himself anymore. He buried his face in Xue Fangli's chest, his voice muffled and the complaint soft and light, "Prince, even if you use more force, I won't break."</p><p>"You can use all your strength; I'm easy to hold."</p>
