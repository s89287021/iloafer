						<p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He didn't want this whitewash; it was too embarrassing. Jiang Juan sincerely said, "There's no misunderstanding. You can know a person by their appearance but not by their heart. In fact, I'm particularly vicious."</p><p>"Just you?" Xue Congyun started mimicking him again, "You brought me something and now you ask me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Congyun pressed on, "Then you can't do this either."</p><p>Xue Congyun burst into laughter again, and Jiang Juan could no longer tolerate it. He decided to hurt Xue Congyun back.</p><p>"Is this the good thing you mentioned?" Jiang Juan said with a hint of sarcasm, "It's nothing special. I've seen things like this many times; they're not impressive at all."</p><p>The little gadget was indeed ingenious, but before reading the book, Jiang Juan had enjoyed visiting museums, so he truly had seen quite a few similar items. His statement wasn't purely to hurt Xue Congyun.</p><p>Sure enough, Xue Congyun stopped laughing when he heard this.</p><p>Since childhood, he had been very competitive and, being a prince, no one dared say anything bad about him; almost everyone went along with his wishes. But Jiang Juan repeatedly made him feel frustrated.</p><p>Xue Congyun was ready to explode again, "What do you mean by 'nothing special'? Take a good look at it. Its craftsmanship, its charm—could there be any better?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down and slowly said, "Yeah, it's pretty good."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>Damn, he felt like he was being brushed off again.</p><p>He took a deep breath; the golden cicada jade leaf didn't work, but there was still the emerald peacock. Xue Congyun carefully pulled out the emerald peacock and asked, "What about this one?"</p><p>He pointed to the colors on the peacock's feathers, afraid Jiang Juan wouldn't recognize its value, and specially explained, "This is called 'Five Blessings Arriving at the Door'—such a small piece of jade, it incorporates five different colors. Do you know how rare that is?"</p><p>Indeed, it was quite rare, and the jade peacock was beautifully carved. However, Jiang Juan still used his bluffing technique, "Ah, so this is how it is, I understand."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "……"</p><p>No, you don't.</p><p>If he truly understood its value, shouldn't he start praising it?</p><p>His vanity unsatisfied, Xue Congjun glared at Jiang Juan and could only vent in fury, "What's wrong with you? You're not even reacting! What do you mean by 'nothing special'? I think you just don't know what good things are!"</p><p>Xue Congjun muttered angrily, "You stinky hick, look at it properly again!"</p><p>He thrust the jade peacock into Jiang Juan's hands with a huff, as if he wanted to force Jiang Juan to look closely, determined that Jiang Juan would see something wonderful today.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him. If this continued, he might get remembered for his trouble, so he told the truth, "I was fooling you; both of these are valuable items."</p><p>After saying that, he smiled, his soft lips curling slightly, and under his wet lashes, his eyes shimmered with moisture. At this moment, the teenager's features were vivid.</p><p>Xue Congjun froze. Although he had been fooled like this, he should have been angry, but upon seeing Jiang Juan's smile, he lost his temper and sighed heavily, "I knew it…"</p><p>Although the process was not satisfactory, the result was good; Xue Congjun's vanity was finally satisfied. He waved his hand grandly, "Since you recognize its value, they're yours."</p><p>Jiang Juan naturally couldn't accept that. He declined, "No need, it's too valuable."</p><p>"Valuable?" Upon hearing this, Xue Congjun was even more elated. He pretended to be indifferent and said, "Items of such quality are plenty in my warehouse; once taken out, they won't be put back. Keep them."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "……"</p><p>Is the Sixth Prince a reincarnation of a money-spending child?</p><p>Jiang Juan was at a loss for words. However, he suddenly remembered a plot point.</p><p>-- The main character received a birthday celebration.</p><p>According to tradition, young people should not have birthdays, but the main character was the apple of everyone's eye. He could not resist the insistence of his friends and Duke Pinghai to throw him a party.</p><p>On that day, the celebrations were quite grand. First, the three closest friends of the main character—Prince Liu, the son of the Chancellor, and the son of the General—came to present gifts.</p><p>All three came from wealthy families and were generous with their offerings, especially Prince Liu, who seemed eager to empty his treasury.</p><p>Duke Pinghai was naturally not one to be outdone. The main character was his fiancée, and this was her last birthday celebration in the Ministry of Revenue. He prepared a "ten-mile-long procession of gifts," which became quite a talk among the people in the capital.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>The name came to mind, but Jiang Juan just could not recall it.</p><p>He thought hard but still could not remember and eventually gave up.</p><p>At any rate, it was neither the golden cicada nor the jade leaf with the green peacock.</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment before saying to Xue Congjun, "I'll take only the peacock. I'll skip the golden cicada."</p><p>"Got it," Xue Congjun crossed his legs and said proudly, "You don't like the golden cicada? Come visit my mansion another day to pick out some other items. It's just—just—"</p><p>"to broaden your horizons as a country bumpkin!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Thank you?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "No need to be polite."</p><p>He came straight for the treasures, and now he was finally satisfied. Xue Congjun looked around curiously and then asked Jiang Juan, "By the way, how did you injure your foot?"</p><p>Last time in the pavilion, Jiang Juan was left with fingerprints all over her hands from her fifth brother. Xue Congjun hesitated for a moment before leaning close and whispering to her, "Is it your fifth brother again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked rapidly and quickly explained, "No, it's me myself..."</p><p>She couldn't bring herself to continue speaking. Hearing this, Xue Congjun was even more convinced of his suspicions.</p><p>"Ah, my fifth brother can be quite ruthless when he loses control," Xue Congjun said sympathetically, "Especially during these times, be careful."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him blankly, "What's happening during these times?"</p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Hearing this, Xue Congjun leaned even closer and whispered to Jiang Juan, "At the end of the month is Lady Youmeiren's memorial day—my fifth brother's mother's. On that day, no matter what, don't provoke him, or else..."</p><p>Before he could finish, a creak sounded as the door opened from outside.</p><p>This was like saying Cao Cao would arrive immediately. Xue Fangli glanced over, and Xue Congjun felt a chill run down his spine, nearly sitting on the ground.</p><p>He hurriedly put down his legs, extinguishing that domineering aura and becoming submissive like a frightened dove, "F-Fifth Brother, you're back."</p><p>Xue Fangli entered, naturally noticing them from how close they were. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan coldly, then paused.</p><p>The boy's eyelashes still clung with water droplets, clearly having cried recently, and obviously having been provoked by someone.</p><p>He didn't ask Jiang Juan anything but said calmly, "Younger Brother Six, I heard you mention wanting to teach a country bumpkin a lesson when I arrived earlier."</p><p>"Who is the country bumpkin?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "... "</p><p>He opened his mouth, deciding to play dumb. "Ah, a country bumpkin? What country bumpkin, there isn't one. Fifth Brother, you must have heard wrong."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Really?"</p><p>Xue Congjun nodded vigorously and then turned his head desperately seeking help from Jiang Juan, his desperate will for survival making him quickly change his words, "Brother Juan! Brother Juan—! Did Fifth Brother hear wrong, right?"</p><p>He wasn't really surprised that his fifth brother would investigate this. After all, Jiang Juan was still the Concubine's son. No matter how brutally his fifth brother treated the Concubine, outsiders still had to maintain some propriety.</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment, after all, he couldn't refuse when someone was paying him off; he eventually nodded, "…Yeah."</p><p>Xue Congjun was just about to relax when Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan again, "Then why are you crying?"</p><p>Xue Congjun turned his head and saw that Jiang Juan's eyelashes were still wet and stuck together. His heart sank once more.</p><p>——He had scared him into tears!</p><p>Xue Congjun desperately tried to signal Jiang Juan, but Jiang Juan didn't look at him. Xue Congjun could only struggle to swallow hard, feeling as if this time he would be thrown to the bugs by his fifth brother.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan finally spoke up, but instead of denying it, he said, "…My foot hurts."</p><p>Xue Congjun was stunned. He didn't expect that Jiang Juan would take the blame for him, especially given how brutally his fifth brother had treated him.</p><p>The more Xue Congjun thought about it, the more moved he became, and he completely changed his opinion of Jiang Juan.</p><p>——This guy is actually quite decent.</p><p>In reality, Jiang Juan was just ashamed to admit the truth.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at him with a somewhat careless smile that slowly turned cold.</p><p>He was lying.</p><p>His concubine, for Xue Congjun, lied to him.</p><p>This realization made Xue Fangli feel displeased, and his anger and brutality began to surge once again.</p><p>Jiang Juan was insensitive to the atmosphere, but at this moment, it was too quiet. He spread out his hands, sharing his joy, "Your Highness, look at this jade-green peacock. Isn't it beautiful?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked over indifferently.</p><p>Beautiful?</p><p>It's just a piece of stone.</p><p>On their wedding day, he hadn't touched any of the gift boxes sent into his courtyard, but he was so pleased to receive a jade-green peacock.</p><p>After a long silence, Xue Fangli said blandly, "That's all."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "... "</p><p>His damned desire for victory and defeat.</p><p>No, this is his fifth brother. He couldn't provoke him; he had to endure.</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed with an "ah," but he wasn't unhappy either. After all, aesthetics were a very personal matter. He just said, "I quite like its theme."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, suppressing his inner irritation and smiled, asking, "Do you like peacocks?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. There was a white peacock near the hospital where he had lived for a year, and Jiang Juan often watched it spreading its tail feathers from the window.</p><p>"Spreading its tail is beautiful, especially the white peacock."</p><p>"A jade-carved peacock, no matter how lifelike it may be, remains an inanimate object," Xue Fangli said slowly. "If you like them, I can take you to see some of the live peacocks at Beizhuang after we finish our meal."</p><p>Jiang Juan expressed her surprise, "There are even peacocks here?"</p><p>He unconsciously put down the jade peacock in his hand. Seeing this, Xue Fangli's mood finally calmed slightly. He nodded and said, "If I remember correctly, there is also a white peacock."</p><p>High Official: "?"</p><p>Unable to contain himself any longer, he muttered, "Your Highness, our villa doesn't have..."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him with an enigmatic smile, "Two blue peacocks and one white peacock."</p><p>The High Official shivered internally and quickly corrected himself, "Oh dear, what a coincidence, there are indeed several peacocks here, and just the white peacock that the Princess Consort likes."</p><p>After pausing for a moment, the High Official said, "Since the Princess Consort likes them, I will immediately have someone clean up to avoid any mess."</p><p>Xue Fangli agreed, "Alright, go ahead."</p><p>The High Official left with a broad smile, his steps unhurried. But as soon as he closed the door, he rushed out like his buttocks were on fire.</p><p>——I must get three peacocks before the Princess Consort finishes her meal!</p>
