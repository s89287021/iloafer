						<p>The aftermath of a night of drunkenness is always feeling unwell. Half a day was slept away, and when Jiang Juan woke up, he still had no energy. He reflected to himself, "I will never drink alcohol again."</p><p>He drank a small pot, but ended up feeling weak and suffering from headaches and stomachaches; he did not feel comfortable at all.</p><p>When Lan Ting saw him wake up, she quickly brought a bowl of congee. Upon hearing this, she said worriedly, "Master, you must remember not to drink alcohol again in the future."</p><p>After pausing for a moment, she added, "Master has slept through an entire day; finish your congee and fill your stomach."</p><p>Jiang Juan sat over, stirred the congee a few times with his chopsticks, but he had no appetite. He put down the chopsticks and said, "I don't want to eat."</p><p>Just as someone entered the room, Jiang Juan did not lift his head to look but instead pushed away the bowl of congee and slumped onto the table listlessly.</p><p>His long hair was untied; with this posture, his black hair spilled over his shoulders like clouds or waterfalls. A hand reached out, brushing it behind his ear, then holding his chin up so he would lift his face.</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice sounded leisurely, "You're awake?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pushed him a few times but did not manage to push him away. Instead, he extended the same hand in front of Xue Fangli and slowly asked, "Prince Wang, why are you biting me?"</p><p>His fair fingers, with their slightly pink tips, bore several teeth marks.</p><p>What happened after drinking was a blur for Jiang Juan, but he remembered clearly being bitten a few times. Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow slightly and took hold of this hand, rubbing his fingertips gently. "Don't remember?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I don't remember."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him with a carefree tone, "Your hands are stained with alcohol; the Prince must taste it too."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?!"</p><p>He was stunned. Jiang Juan asked incoherently, "Hands? What should the Prince taste? The alcohol stains on my fingers?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said "eh" in a nonchalant manner, seemingly staring at him.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>If he hadn't spoken out of turn, he could have been very happy. Jiang Juan remained silent for a while and sincerely apologized to him, "Your Highness, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I promise I won't drink anymore in the future."</p><p>"No need," Xue Fangli said with a slight smile. "A little drinking can be pleasant. An occasional drink won't make any difference."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still in a state of collapse and had completely failed to notice the profound meaning behind Xue Fangli's words, thus overlooking an important matter.</p><p>—Ever since he got him to taste the wine, if Your Highness didn't cooperate, he wouldn't have forced Your Highness being drunk.</p><p>In any case, Jiang Juan was full of shame. He felt that he must have done many other things back then but lacked the courage to ask Your Highness about them, so he could only choose to pretend to be dead. Jiang Juan muttered, "I'm not worthy of such poor drinking skills. I'm also unworthy of a little pleasant drink."</p><p>A little pleasant drink, whose emotions does it please? Xue Fangli naturally wouldn't explain this to Jiang Juan; he merely glanced at the untouched porridge and asked in a gentle tone, "You haven't woken up hungry yet?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "I have no appetite."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a few moments and said, "Get ready. This King will eat one of your fingers."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't really want to, "I..."</p><p>His fingertip was lifted again, pinched and rubbed a couple of times. Jiang Juan remained silent for a few seconds before looking into Xue Fangli's eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Not willing?"</p><p>His finger was rubbed one by one, forcing Jiang Juan to recall how he had forced Your Highness to eat his fingertip back then. After some thought, Jiang Juan reluctantly agreed, "Alright."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded slightly, "Eh."</p><p>He really is easy to fool.</p><p>He gazed at Jiang Juan, slowly lifting the corners of his lips, a look of pleasant satisfaction on his face.</p><p>As night fell, the palace was ablaze with lights, everywhere adorned with brilliant fireworks and lanterns.</p><p>The carriage stopped. Jiang Juan lifted the curtain and asked Schue Fangli curiously, "Your Highness, are we here to see the Emperor?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Before Schue Fangli had finished speaking, someone had already come forward. Schue Chaohua greeted him enthusiastically, "Old Five, you guys finally made it."</p><p>After saying that, he raised his chin and scolded Zhang Gonggong beside him, "Madame Wang is frail; why aren't you supporting her?"</p><p>Zhang Gonggong nodded hurriedly, but before he could reach out, Schue Fangli had already picked up Jiang Juan and got down from the carriage on his own. He coolly said two words, "Not necessary."</p><p>Zhang Gonggong was taken aback, lowering his head to look at Schue Chaohua.</p><p>This action undoubtedly took a toll on Schue Chaohua's pride. Though he was displeased, he had matters to request from him and could only force a light-hearted remark, "Old Five, heading to the Hundred Flowers Garden with your own Madame Wang for tonight's banquet, still holding onto your own Madame Wang—can she really be that good to hold? This Palace truly believes—"</p><p>"Unwilling to let go."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Being carried by the Prince, Jiang Juan did not intend this. He gently pushed Schue Fangli a few times, "Your Highness, please put me down."</p><p>Schue Fangli ignored him. After waiting for a little while and seeing no sign of him putting him down, Jiang Juan could only whisper softly, "I want to maintain my dignity too."</p><p>What could be so good to hold, unwilling to let go?</p><p>It sounded rather strange.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and spoke, though not to Jiang Juan. "Does it matter if my concubine is good-looking or not?" Xue Fangli asked coolly, "Brother, do you have no concubines of your own? You seem quite interested in my concubine." Xue Chaohua: "..." His expression froze, almost blurting out a "Are you crazy?" But Xue Chaohua restrained himself and merely said through gritted teeth, "It was inappropriate for me to speak that way. I shouldn't have made such a joke." Xue Fangli ignored him and instead asked Jiang Juan, "Is this acceptable now?" Jiang Juan: "Ah?" Xue Fangli: "Didn't you say one has to save face too?" Jiang Juan: "..." His saving face meant walking with dignity on his own rather than relying on the prince. Seeing that Jiang Juan didn't speak up, Xue Fangli said again, "Brother." Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan hugged Xue Fangli tightly, afraid of any further misunderstandings and another insult to the prince. He quickly said, "It's fine now, Your Highness, really, it's fine." Xue Fangli responded with a "Mn," while Xue Chaohua turned his head and asked gently, "What's wrong?" Xue Fangli's tone remained flat as he replied, "Nothing is wrong." Xue Chaohua: "..." His forehead was bulging with veins, and Zhang Gonggong approached with an expression of concern. Xue Chaohua waved him away and said through clenched teeth, "It's good that nothing is wrong."</p><p>Xue Chaohua personally greeted them, and not long after, the few of them entered the banquet.</p><p>Xue Chaohua, being a prince, had always been very particular about grandeur. For today's dinner, he had made considerable efforts. After Jiang Juan sat down, Xue Fangli introduced him with a smile: "This is the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet."</p><p>"It features flavors from various regions, including fried, sautéed, stir-fried, and roasted dishes, offering diverse tastes of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. It balances meat and vegetables and uses high-quality ingredients."</p><p>Jiang Juan had only heard of the Manhan Quanxi, but this was his first time hearing about the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet, so he curiously looked down at it.</p><p>Xue Fangli put an arm around him and asked, "Are you hungry?"</p><p>The dishes in the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet were delicious, and they smelled great too. However, Jiang Juan couldn't even drink porridge, let alone think of these foods. He shook his head, saying, "I'm not hungry."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, "Big brother."</p><p>Xue Chaohua was still enthusiastically explaining the merits of this Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet when he was suddenly interrupted and asked impatiently, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Is lotus leaf soup available here?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua froze, "Ah? Lotus leaf soup?"</p><p>When his concubine was pregnant, she suffered from severe morning sickness and couldn't eat anything. Since it was their first grandchild, Emperor Hongxing had paid great attention to her and specially brought in a renowned chef from Jiangnan. The lotus leaf soup was the chef's specialty.</p><p>Although Xue Chaohua didn't understand his brother's intention, he still replied, "Of course we can make it."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Serve me a bowl of lotus leaf soup then."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "?"</p><p>He insisted, "Little Brother, making lotus leaf soup is easy; you can always have it whenever you want. But the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet is not so easily arranged. Why don't you try it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coldly, "Lotus leaf soup will suffice."</p><p>Xue Chaohua personally welcomed them, and shortly after, they were seated at the banquet.</p><p>As a prince known for his attention to grandeur, Xue Chaohua had put considerable effort into organizing this evening's feast. Once Jiang Juan was seated, he warmly introduced him: "This is the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet."</p><p>"It features a blend of flavors from different regions, offering fried, sautéed, stir-fried, and roasted dishes. The menu includes a variety of tastes—salty, sweet, sour, and spicy—and balances meat and vegetables with high-quality ingredients."</p><p>Though Jiang Juan was familiar with the Manhan Quanxi, this Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet was new to him. He curiously surveyed the spread.</p><p>Xue Fangli draped an arm around him and asked, "Are you hungry?"</p><p>The dishes looked delicious and smelled appetizing, but Jiang Juan, unable even to drink porridge, couldn't muster an appetite for such a feast. He shook his head, declining, "I'm not hungry."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, "Big brother."</p><p>Still engrossed in explaining the merits of the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet, Xue Chaohua was taken aback by the interruption and asked impatiently, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Is lotus leaf soup available here?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua froze, "Ah? Lotus leaf soup?"</p><p>His concubine had suffered severe morning sickness during her pregnancy, unable to eat anything. Since it was their first grandchild, Emperor Hongxing had been particularly concerned and specially brought in a renowned chef from Jiangnan. The lotus leaf soup was the chef's specialty.</p><p>Though Xue Chaohua didn't understand his brother's intention, he replied, "Of course we can make it."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Serve me a bowl of lotus leaf soup then."</p><p>Xue Chaohua looked puzzled and asked, "?"</p><p>He insisted, "Little Brother, making lotus leaf soup is easy; you can always have it whenever you want. But the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet is not easily arranged. Why don't you try it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coldly, "Lotus leaf soup will suffice."</p><p>Xue Chaohua personally welcomed them, and soon enough, they found themselves seated at the banquet.</p><p>A prince renowned for his flair for grandeur, Xue Chaohua had lavished considerable effort on this evening's feast. As Jiang Juan took his seat, Xue Fangli introduced him with a warm smile: "This is the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet."</p><p>"A culinary masterpiece that combines flavors from various regions, featuring fried, sautéed, stir-fried, and roasted dishes. The menu offers an array of tastes—salty, sweet, sour, and spicy—and strikes a perfect balance between meat and vegetables with high-quality ingredients."</p><p>Though Jiang Juan was familiar with the Manhan Quanxi, he had never heard of the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet before. He looked down at the spread curiously.</p><p>Xue Fangli draped an arm around him and asked, "Are you hungry?"</p><p>The dishes were sumptuous and smelled delectable, but Jiang Juan, unable to even drink porridge, couldn't muster an appetite for such a feast. He shook his head, declining, "I'm not hungry."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow in surprise, "Big brother."</p><p>Still caught up in explaining the intricacies of the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet, Xue Chaohua was taken aback by the interruption and asked impatiently, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Is lotus leaf soup available here?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua froze, "Ah? Lotus leaf soup?"</p><p>His concubine had suffered severe morning sickness during her pregnancy, unable to eat anything. Since it was their first grandchild, Emperor Hongxing had been particularly concerned and specially brought in a renowned chef from Jiangnan. The lotus leaf soup was the chef's specialty.</p><p>Though Xue Chaohua didn't understand his brother's intention, he replied, "Of course we can make it."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Serve me a bowl of lotus leaf soup then."</p><p>Xue Chaohua looked puzzled and asked, "?"</p><p>He insisted, "Little Brother, making lotus leaf soup is easy; you can always have it whenever you want. But the Golden Jade Full Hall Banquet is not easily arranged. Why don't you try it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coldly, "Lotus leaf soup will suffice."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>He moved his lips, the words "not knowing good from bad" almost slipped out, but he managed to hold back and just gave an eye signal to Zhang Gonggong.</p><p>This man was very face-conscious, and also had a grudge against Xue Fangli. Therefore, when inviting Xue Fangli, he deliberately made it as troublesome as possible. As a result, after carefully preparing for the entire day, Xue Fangli only wanted a bowl of lotus leaf soup. All his efforts went down the drain.</p><p>Xue Chaohua became increasingly annoyed. He was about to say something, but turned around and saw Xue Fangli chatting idly with Jiang Juan.</p><p>"He has no other choice, only the lotus leaf soup is acceptable, sweet and refreshing. If he says he's not hungry, I specially brought it over for him to taste."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>As if this place were a restaurant?</p><p>Xue Chaohua took a sip of wine, repeatedly telling himself that he wasn't angry. He wouldn't bother with this madman, but—</p><p>Old Five treated his concubine genuinely well.</p><p>One day, even Old Five would start to care about people, which was truly unexpected.</p><p>Xue Chaohua snorted and felt even more convinced that getting Duke of Anping to intervene could make this happen.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Chaohua raised his head and looked out at the lotus pond outside the window.</p><p>Jiang Juan also looked up, but he wasn't looking at the pond; he was staring at the night sky. This should have been a clear moonlit night, but clouds had suddenly covered it. Jiang Juan said softly, "Your Highness, it seems like it's going to rain."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a nod, "It won't last long, and there's no problem staying inside."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't worried anymore, and soon his lotus leaf soup was brought over, along with Empress Su Miaoyin of Xue Chaohua.</p><p>"Is this Lady Wangfei?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Not really."</p><p>After meals, he was unwilling to take a walk, let alone before meals. Jiang Juan shook his head and said honestly, "I want to sit and wait for the lotus seed soup to cool down; I don't want to take a walk."</p><p>Su Miaoyin: "..."</p><p>She choked slightly, looking at Xue Chaohua with some difficulty and then said, "Your Highness, Prince Wang should have important matters to discuss today. Listening to those things makes my head ache. If the Princess doesn’t want to take a walk, why not sit for a while?"</p><p>"There's a boat tied to the lotus pond; when there’s nothing else to do, I can go up and sit on it, which is rather leisurely."</p><p>Jiang Juan said earnestly, "Prince Wang sitting here is good enough; no need to sit elsewhere."</p><p>He was just too lazy, but in Su Miaoyin's eyes, he seemed stubborn. Suppressing her impatience, she said tactfully, "The Princess seems to be inseparable from Prince Wang."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, she continued slowly, "There’s an old saying that the small victories of newlyweds are sweet. The Princess is too attached to Prince Wang."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a few seconds and started to bluff, "Yeah, you're right."</p><p>Xue Fangli, on the other hand, asked Jiang Juan lazily, "Have you ever been attached to this Prince?"</p><p>Before Jiang Juan could answer, Xue Fangli continued, "Has there ever been a time when it wasn't this Prince who was attached to you?"</p><p>"If you were willing to be attached to this Prince and not leave me for even a moment, I would be much happier than I am now."</p><p>His tone was leisurely as he spoke to Jiang Juan, but his gaze slowly fell on Su Miaoyin, cold enough to shock her. She returned his stare and felt her heart skip a beat, realizing something.</p><p>——The Prince of Departure is warning her.</p><p>It seemed like he had noticed something.</p><p>Yes, with such repeated persuasion, if the Prince of Departure hadn't realized anything, he wouldn’t be the Prince of Departure.</p><p>Sū Miàoyīn reluctantly, Xi Cháohuā shook his head, and then politely excused herself from the banquet, hurrying to the lotus pond.</p><p>Duke of Anping had been waiting for a long time again as per their agreement; Sū Miàoyīn would bring Jiàng Juàn along. Seeing only Sū Miàoyīn arrive alone, Duke of Anping's face darkened, "Where is Consort Wang... not seeing this Lord?"</p><p>Sū Miàoyīn explained, "This servant made up an excuse to take a stroll by the pond, but Consort Wang refused twice. Since His Majesty was around, I did not dare to continue persuading."</p><p>It turned out he wasn't here.</p><p>Thinking of this, Duke of Anping picked off a floating leaf and wrote the character for 'zhào' on it before giving it to Sū Miàoyīn, "Let someone deliver this to Consort Wang. He will understand upon seeing it."</p><p>Sū Miàoyīn said, "Then... Your Excellency, do you need to wait a little longer? After all, His Majesty is here, and he seems to have noticed something."</p><p>Duke of Anping nodded, "Mm, this Lord understands."</p><p>Sū Miàoyīn turned away, and shortly after, Grandee Zhang chuckled as he brought over lotus leaves, saying, "Consort Wang did not take a stroll; the Empress had someone pick these lotus leaves to send to you."</p><p>Jiàng Juàn took the lotus leaves. As soon as she fiddled with them, Xue Fàlí said from afar, "The lotus seed soup can be drunk now."</p><p>As usual, Xue Fàlí fed her, and Jiàng Juàn tasted a small mouthful; it was indeed refreshing and delicious. She no longer had an appetite but ate happily, immediately putting down the lotus leaves to focus on eating.</p><p>At this time, a gust of wind suddenly blew outside, and rain began pouring heavily.</p><p>Rain cascaded in torrents, with only the sound of wind and rain heard within Chengde Palace, while at the lotus pond, there was no place to shelter from the storm. Duke of Anping stood in the rain with his brows tightly knitted.</p><p>Why hasn't he come yet?</p><p>The rain grew heavier, and he was thoroughly drenched, his vision blurred. Duke of Anping tried to leave several times but couldn't help hoping due to Sū Miàoyīn's words.</p><p>——Perhaps Jiàng Juàn has already obtained the lotus leaves and is rushing over.</p><p>Let me wait a bit longer.</p>
