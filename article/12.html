						<p>Jiang Juan fell unconscious in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>The glass shards were removed, and Sun Taishi bandaged Jiang Juan up before instructing him, "Don't get out of bed or touch water for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan weakly nodded his head.</p><p>Clung to Xue Fangli's embrace, he had merely gotten his hair damp during the herbal bath earlier; now beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. The youth exuded a sweet scent of herbs all over.</p><p>Sniffing Jiang Juan's breath, Xue Fangli's hand occasionally rubbed at Jiang Juan's nape, looking rather absent-minded yet unusually relaxed.</p><p>Sun Taishi had never seen anyone more afraid of pain than Jiang Juan and couldn't help but laugh. "Rest well."</p><p>Jiang Juan was indeed tired; he raised his head and asked Xue Fangli listlessly, "Your Highness, how do I get back?"</p><p>Unable to walk and unwilling to burden a girl from Orchid Pavilion with carrying him, Jiang Juan replied: "No need, rest here."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't particularly eager to move either. Upon hearing this, he grabbed the bed rail and said sullenly, "Then I'll sleep here."</p><p>He conscientiously chose the beauty couch without trying to take Xue Fangli's bed.</p><p>Holding onto the beauty couch, Jiang Juan leaned over and pulled away from Xue Fangli's embrace. The scent lingering in his nostrils began to fade; Xue Fangli frowned slightly but nodded calmly.</p><p>Standing up, the entire couch was now Jiang Juan's. He fell asleep almost immediately, drowsy, when suddenly a passage from a book came to mind.</p><p>— "That night, King Li went to another villa. In the middle of the night, he fell gravely ill and coughed up blood uncontrollably. The accompanying imperial physician hurried over but was helpless; before dawn broke, news of King Li's death had reached the capital. Upon hearing this, the emperor flew into a rage, adjourning court for three days and executing more than a hundred people."</p><p>In the middle of the night, he fell gravely ill.</p><p>Before dawn broke, news of his death had reached the capital.</p><p>When Dr. Sun finished treating Jiang Juan's foot injury, it seemed like dawn was already breaking.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>Lan Ting had just been brought in and was wiping Jiang Juan's face. Seeing this, she quietly asked, "Did the maid disturb Young Master?"</p><p>Jiang Juan absentmindedly shook his head, turned to look outside, and saw that it was already faintly light.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>What is going on with this novel? Not only does the Prince's character differ so much, but the plot doesn't match up either.</p><p>In the middle of the night, the Prince didn't have an emergency; instead, a pack of wolves arrived.</p><p>Wait a moment.</p><p>With so many wolves, if he had arrived later or not at all, and hadn't paid attention to the young wolf's unusual behavior, wouldn't something happen to the Prince?</p><p>Perhaps, the Prince's death was originally an accident, not an emergency at all?</p><p>He had spent almost half the night with the Prince, who really didn't have an emergency.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>That does make sense.</p><p>So, he seems to have accidentally saved the Prince and changed the plot.</p><p>Upon realizing this, Jiang Juan felt a bit complicated.</p><p>The Prince was a kind man. Every time Jiang Juan thought about his fate, she felt regret. Now that the Prince was safe and sound, it could not have been better.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan did not feel well at all. He had come to lead a carefree life and had planned how to be happy after the Prince's death.</p><p>But now...</p><p>His carefree life was gone, and happiness eluded him.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Seeing the scene, Xue Fangli spoke indifferently, and Jiang Juan sullenly shook her head, "Nothing."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at him. The young man had pale skin; even a light collision made his forehead red. He asked, "What are you unhappy about?"</p><p>Of course, it was the loss of his imagined happy life—staying single for the longest time, being the saltiest fish, and living out his days in the prince's mansion.</p><p>But Jiang Juan could not tell the truth. He lazily replied, "...My feet hurt."</p><p>Not mentioning it was fine, but as soon as he said it, Jiang Juan realized another issue.</p><p>The plot had changed; there were no casualties in the mansion except for his feet.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be.</p><p>Why did the saltfish get injured?</p><p>Was this the consequence of not trying hard enough?</p><p>Jiang Juan gently collided with the railing, completely resembling a lifeless salted fish without dreams.</p><p>Unable to control himself, he started thinking aimlessly.</p><p>No way.</p><p>He only wanted to be a lifeless salted fish, not a concubine.</p><p>Perhaps he should leave?</p><p>According to the plot, he also had a grandfather. Going back to the countryside to seek refuge with his grandfather might be a good idea. The more Jiang Juan thought about it, the more feasible it seemed. He regained some spirit and said, "Prince..."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Xue Fangli responded absentmindedly, his gaze lingering on Jiang Juan for a long time, his expression unreadable.</p><p>He was lying.</p><p>The reason the teenager was unhappy was not because of his foot injury.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt guilty as he said, "On our wedding day, you promised to send me off and asked if I would reconsider in a few days. Now, you can ask again."</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched, "What is it?"</p><p>"I've changed my mind," Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "I realized that I've been causing you trouble all along. Perhaps... it's better for you to send me away."</p><p>After hearing this, Xue Fangli did not immediately respond; his expression remained unchanged. He simply parted his red lips, giving a careless smile before saying regretfully, "It can't be done."</p><p>While the teenager cried in his arms, every minute and second earlier when he said he wanted to leave, he would have let him go. But now that he was saying it again, it was too late; even he had changed his mind.</p><p>"How can it even be considered a bother?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...considered."</p><p>He hadn't given up yet and wanted to struggle some more. Jiang Juan had an idea and said, "Your Majesty, I've always been sickly and difficult to cure. The master said that the year of eighteen is a turning point and I might not survive it. I'm afraid I will pass my illness on to you."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, "It's fine; this king already has an incurable condition, which has nothing to do with you."</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli asked thoughtfully, "Is that why you're unhappy?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and couldn't explain it to him, so he nodded, "Yeah, I'm afraid I will hold you back."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Alright."</p><p>He had forgotten about this matter. So Jiang Juan was truly unable to leave for the time being.</p><p>However—</p><p>Was the king's incurable condition coughing up blood?</p><p>Jiang Juan recalled what he had said on their wedding day.</p><p>"—I have little time left, would you like me to send you off?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pondered for a few seconds.</p><p>Perhaps, or maybe, he could still become the saltiest fish.</p><p>No way, how can I think like that?</p><p>Jiang Juan inwardly berated herself fiercely but then lay back honestly.</p><p>—Section Three has arrived; if I endure a bit longer, it might not be such a big problem?</p><p>Shangshu Mansion.</p><p>Jiang Nian picked up a cup of hot tea, lowered his head, and blew lightly on it. The tea leaves swirled in the cup, steam rising to his face, yet his thoughts drifted away uncontrollably.</p><p>In his previous life, he was already heading to Beizhuang.</p><p>—Duke Li had died.</p><p>He feared this man so much that even hearing of his death did not prompt him to pay his last respects or see him one last time. However, as Duke Li's wife, Jiang Nian could not avoid it and thus boarded the carriage.</p><p>Luckily, Jiang Nian did not manage to catch up.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, the Emperor personally rushed to Beizhuang. Upon seeing the body, he wept bitterly and, unable to bear it any longer, had the coffin sealed and directly taken to the mausoleum.</p><p>Relaxing, Jiang Nian came back to his senses but could not help frowning again.</p><p>Why has Father not returned yet?</p><p>Today, there was no court session scheduled.</p><p>In Jiang Nian's memory, Duke Li had died in the middle of the night on that day, and the Emperor did not attend morning court. Therefore, Father should have been back long ago.</p><p>Suddenly, a feeling of unease rose in his heart.</p><p>Another two incense sticks' worth of time passed before sounds were finally heard at the door.</p><p>"Xiao Nian, what's going on?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu strode over. He had heard that Jiang Nian was waiting for him in the study and hurriedly came over. "Is there anything?"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook her head and asked, "Father, where have you been? Why are you back now?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu laughed wryly and said, "I went to court today since it wasn't a rest day."</p><p>Court?</p><p>Jiang Nian was taken aback and hesitantly asked, "Father, did anything happen last night?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu never hid court matters from him and had intentionally prepared Jiang Nian for them. However, there really hadn't been much of interest today, so he replied, "No, what's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Nian pressed on, "What happened?"</p><p>Jiang Nian blurted out, "Then what about the Li Wang?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu looked puzzled, "What about the Li Wang?"</p><p>"Is he alright?"</p><p>"What could happen to him?"</p><p>Jiang Nian sized up Jiang Shushu a few times. Seeing that he was genuinely confused and unaware, she couldn't help but pinch her palm hard.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>It seems that Wang Li has not been harmed, and the Emperor did not dismiss court today.</p><p>Since his reincarnation, everything Jiang Nian experienced was the same as in his previous life; there had never been any unexpected events.</p><p>"This shouldn't happen..."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Nian's pale face, Secretary Jiang asked worriedly, "Xiao Nian, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Nian did not speak but only frowned tightly.</p><p>He always regarded reincarnation as a gift. Furthermore, after having been reborn once, Jiang Nian was able to take advantage of the information gap to avoid disasters and seek what he wanted. Yet now, something unexpected had happened.</p><p>How could Wang Li be unharmed?</p><p>He should have died.</p><p>Jiang Nian feared this man but still wished to confirm it. Taking a deep breath, Jiang Nian managed to calm himself slightly and suggested to Secretary Jiang, "Father, let's visit our younger brother."</p><p>"Visit him?" Secretary Jiang frowned. "It's unnecessary. He may not even appreciate your visit if you go there."</p><p>Secretary Jiang knew very well what kind of person Wang Li was without Jiang Nian saying anything. Pausing for a moment, Jiang Nian expressed his sympathy deeply: "Our younger brother lives with the Wang family day and night, so he must be constantly tormented and fearful."</p><p>Secretary Jiang did not care at all. "He has such malicious thoughts; it's what he deserves."</p><p>Helplessly, Jiang Nian said, "Father..."</p><p>To Secretary Jiang, Jiang Juan was dispensable, but Jiang Nian was different. Seeing his determination to visit their younger brother, Secretary Jiang finally agreed: "Very well, let's go and see him then."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>It seems that Wang Li has not been harmed, and the Emperor did not dismiss court today.</p><p>Since his reincarnation, everything Jiang Nian experienced was the same as in his previous life; there had never been any unexpected events.</p><p>"This shouldn't happen..."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Nian's pale face, Secretary Jiang asked worriedly, "Xiao Nian, what's wrong?

Seeing his determination to visit their younger brother, Secretary Jiang finally agreed: "Very well, let's go and see him then."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>It seems that Wang Li has come out unscathed, and the Emperor did not adjourn court today.</p><p>Since his reincarnation, everything Jiang Nian experienced mirrored his previous life; there had never been any unexpected events.</p><p>"This shouldn't happen..."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Nian's pale face, Secretary Jiang asked worriedly, "Xiao Nian, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Nian did not speak but only frowned tightly.</p><p>He always regarded reincarnation as a gift. Furthermore, after having been reborn once, Jiang Nian had leveraged the information gap to avoid disasters and achieve his goals.

Taking a deep breath, Jiang Nian managed to calm himself slightly and suggested to Secretary Jiang, "Father, let's pay our younger brother a visit."</p><p>"Visit him?" Secretary Jiang frowned.

Pausing for a moment, Jiang Nian expressed his sympathy deeply: "Our younger brother lives with the Wang family day and night, so he must be constantly tormented and fearful."</p><p>Secretary Jiang did not care at all. "He harbors such malicious thoughts; it's what he deserves."</p><p>Helplessly, Jiang Nian said, "Father..."</p><p>To Secretary Jiang, Jiang Juan was dispensable, but Jiang Nian was different. Seeing his determination to visit their younger brother, Secretary Jiang finally agreed: "Very well, let's go and see him then."</p><p>"That is because you are kind," said Jiang Shushu, shaking his head helplessly. "Kind people are often bullied by others. You should think more about yourself."</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyes flickered. He smiled slightly and said, "Son understands."</p>
