						<p>It was late at night.</p><p>Gao Geshi entered Liangfeng Garden with a lantern in hand. As the evening fell, the entire palace was silent, with the maids standing silently by his side, while only the singer continued to hum softly.</p><p>"The jade moon is full every night, the jade tree renews itself every morning..."</p><p>Xue Fangli leaned against a soft couch. His hairpin had been removed, and his black hair hung down, contrasting with his pale skin and rosy lips, giving him an eerie beauty.</p><p>"Prince..." Gao Geshi lifted the curtain and walked to his side, whispering, "The gifts have arrived."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked lazily, "Does he like them?"</p><p>Gao Geshi replied truthfully, "Master saw only surprise on Third Young Master's face, no joy. He even asked me to bring these boxes back."</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed and didn't seem to care, "Let's see tomorrow."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he moved his fingers and tossed a few gold leaves into Gao Geshi's arms, "A reward for you."</p><p>Gao Geshi quickly picked one up, biting it with his teeth. He looked at the golden bite mark on the leaf and grinned widely, "Thank you, Prince!"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him.</p><p>Gao Geshi put away the gold leaves and thought about how to spend them—he hadn't visited Hongxiu Pavilion for drinks in a while, and this time he wanted to bring several beautiful maids with him.</p><p>Just as he was enjoying his thoughts, Gao Geshi suddenly remembered something else and suppressed his excitement, saying, "Oh right, Prince, there's one more thing I forgot to mention."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Master arrived just in time to hear Third Young Master say..." Gao Geshi said with an odd expression, "Third Young Master said that the Prince is a good person."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fangli paused, briefly stunned before breaking into a smile.</p><p>"Good man."</p><p>This was the first time Xue Fangli had heard someone praise him this way. Having grown accustomed to cruelty and brutality, this description was truly novel to him.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more intriguing it seemed. With a grin, Xue Fangli asked the singer currently performing, "Hongyu, in your opinion, is this king a good man?"</p><p>The summoned singer shuddered, missing a note on her instrument. She forced herself to speak, "Your Majesty, Your Majesty is naturally a good man."</p><p>"You are lying," Xue Fangli said with pity, "Why are you so afraid? Have you forgotten that I despise insincere words?"</p><p>The singer's face turned pale, and she dared not speak again, hurriedly kneeling down as her hand trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>Xue Fangli slowly reined in his smile, saying with a lackluster tone, "Since you love to kneel, then kneel."</p><p>The singer stopped singing, but the dancers did not stop dancing. As their skirts flared, the high officials hastily exchanged glances, one of them picking up the pipa and stiffly sitting down. Soon enough, the sound of music resumed.</p><p>Xue Fangli drank a few mouthfuls of wine, his expression weary as he lowered his hand. The cup crashed to the ground with a "bang," spilling wine all over the floor, wetting the fabric at his feet, yet he paid no mind.</p><p>Seeing this, one of the high officials walked aside and lit the prepared incense.</p><p>This was incense from the Western Regions, known for its calming and sleep-inducing effects.</p><p>Amidst the soft music, wisps of smoke rose slowly, the scent thickening. In no time, the official fell into a daze. Struggling to keep his eyes open, he glanced at the person on the couch; Xue Fangli's eyes were closed, but his fingers tapped lightly in rhythm.</p><p>The incense was insufficient to affect Xue Fangli; if too much was used, he would sleep soundly through the night but awaken even more fatigued the next day. It was better not to sleep at all.</p><p>The official silently sighed.</p><p>Our king suffers from occasional headaches, and now he can't even get a proper rest.</p><p>It was clear he came from a noble lineage, yet he endured suffering daily, living less happily than anyone else. The manager sighed deeply and then lowered his head to take a nap, unaware that Xue Fangli had opened his eyes on the couch, staring at him thoughtfully.</p><p>In life, one always has desires. This manager avoided the Wangfu like the plague, but he threw himself into the fire pit of serving Xue Fangli solely because of his lewdness. And what about Third Young Master?</p><p>Xue Fangli listened absentmindedly to the music.</p><p>Another sleepless night.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The coachman waited early outside the mansion. When Jiang Juan was helped into the carriage, Xue Fangli had already taken a seat and was resting with his eyes closed.</p><p>The man seemed to have just bathed; there was still some moisture in his hair. Hearing the commotion, he lifted his eyelids, looking lax and tired. "Did you get used to sleeping last night?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not adjust well to new beds; he fell asleep immediately but woke up twice due to the hardness of the bed, though it was an issue that could be overcome. Jiang Juan replied, "It was fine."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, then glanced at him a few times.</p><p>One cannot fall in the same place twice. Today, Jiang Juan specially chose a light green outer robe. The bright color, combined with his unusually beautiful appearance, made him radiant. However, his lips were too pale, and his demeanor too pure; his ethereal body looked like a celestial being even in vibrant colors.</p><p>Apart from that, Jiang Juan was spotless, without any accessories on.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow slightly. "Don't you like those gifts?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not know why he suddenly brought this up but shook his head. "No, I like them."</p><p>He spoke honestly, but his eyes were pure and devoid of desire. Xue Fangli asked him, "If you like them, why don't you use them?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sincerely replied, "It's too precious, and..." Each item is a rare treasure; he doesn't deserve it, afraid of breaking it. If not for the lack of social etiquette, Jiang Juan would have wanted to return it. He just wanted to be a salted fish, content with eating and waiting for death, no need for such grand funeral arrangements.</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't finish his sentence before raising one hand, wearily propping up his forehead. Jiang Juan noticed his discomfort and asked softly, "Did you not sleep well last night?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Is the illness getting worse?</p><p>Jiang Juan held back— he wanted to remind Xue Fangli, but the text clearly stated that even the imperial doctors were helpless against Xue Fangli's condition; reminding him now would be futile.</p><p>People were bustling on the streets, lanterns hanging high, vendors shouting, everything incredibly lively.</p><p>Jiang Juan got excited and asked Xue Fangli, "Can we go for a stroll in the street later?"</p><p>Because of his illness, Jiang Juan was either hospitalized or stayed at home. He actually enjoyed the company but with his heartbroken condition, he might suddenly stop working, so he wasn't allowed to run around.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You want to take a stroll?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Yeah."</p><p>He turned his head, eyes sparkling, Xue Fangli looked at him for a few moments and then said, "You don't like those things."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked blankly, "Ah? What don't you like?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't seem to want to explain, only casually said, "Go take a stroll if you want to."</p><p>He was startled. Xue Fangli raised his eyes, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't look and was worried. Her gaze drifted, "...wolf skin."</p><p>Not far away, a hunter with a hunting knife was neatly cutting up a wolf skin. He occasionally lifted the skin to show it to others, the blood-soaked flesh still barely recognizable.</p><p>Right beneath the hunter's feet was a cage containing a young wolf. It was covered in blood and had wide eyes of fear, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>"Scared?" Xue Fangli lazily asked him.</p><p>"No," Jiang Juan shook his head. He frowned and said, "They're so pitiful."</p><p>"Pitiful..." Xue Fangli laughed, seemingly recalling something, his expression slightly mocking, "Can't bear to see it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. After a brief moment of hesitation, she said, "I think—"</p><p>"The big one is already dead," as if he knew what she was going to say, Xue Fangli slowly replied, "The little one's claws and teeth have been broken. Even if we save it, it won't live long."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, completely unaware of her shock, she said, "How could this be."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked her, "Still want to save it?"</p><p>Of course she wanted to save it. Jiang Juan nodded again, but with the young wolf injured so badly, it wasn't just about buying it and releasing it back into the mountains. Jiang Juan hesitated as she looked at Xue Fangli.</p><p>—Keeping a pet requires approval from roommates. Xue Fangli could be considered her roommate, after all.</p><p>"Can we?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sought his opinion. Xue Fangli asked curiously, "Why do you want to save it? Its wolf teeth and claws are broken. What good will keeping it do you?"</p><p>"It has been tormented so pitifully," Jiang Juan said uncertainly, "And it might still be useful somehow? Once it recovers, it can guard the house and probably scare some people too."</p><p>He jumped in surprise as Xue Fangli lifted his eyes, asking, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't bring herself to look and was deeply worried. Her gaze wandered, "...wolf skin."</p><p>Not far away, a hunter with a hunting knife was deftly cutting up a wolf pelt. He occasionally raised the pelt to show others, the blood-soaked flesh barely recognizable.</p><p>Right beneath his feet was a cage containing a young wolf, its body drenched in blood, eyes wide with fear as it trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>"Scared?" Xue Fangli asked lazily.</p><p>"No," Jiang Juan shook her head, frowning slightly. "They're so pitiful."</p><p>"Pitiful..." Xue Fangli laughed, his expression turning slightly mocking as if he had recalled something. "Can't bear to see it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. After a brief moment of hesitation, she said, "I think—"</p><p>"The big one is already dead," as if he anticipated her words, Xue Fangli slowly replied, "The little one's claws and teeth have been broken. Even if we save it, it won't live long."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, completely unaware of her shock, she exclaimed, "How could this be?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked her, "Still want to save it?"</p><p>Of course she wanted to save it.

Once it recovers, it can guard the house and probably scare some people too."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him without speaking. For some reason, he recalled something High Official Shi had said.</p><p>—"When I arrived, I just heard Third Young Master say… Third Young Master said that the Prince is a good man.”</p><p>Good man.</p><p>“You asked this king’s opinion,” Xue Fangli smiled and shook his head, “No.”</p><p>Jiang Juan: “Alright then.”</p><p>His tone was a bit downcast, but he didn’t blame anyone; he just turned to look at the young wolf quietly, his eyelashes lowered as he tried to think hard.</p><p>So obedient, too obedient.</p><p>Xue Fangli watched him leisurely, his fingers touching the small leaf purple sandalwood beads on his wrist, rubbing them intermittently until Jiang Juan spoke again.</p><p>“Lanting.”</p><p>He called for the maid, and Lanting looked at him in confusion. Jiang Juan said to her, “Help me buy those two wolves; give the hunter a bit more silver. For the one that was skinned… have the hunter bury it. As for the smaller one, take care of its injuries and then release it.”</p><p>Jiang Juan did his best.</p><p>No matter what, let’s save its life first.</p><p>Lanting nodded and went to do as she was told, but just as he spoke, the hunter had already skinned the entire wolf and opened the cage, picking up the young wolf inside, preparing to harm it.</p><p>The young wolf was pinned on the cutting board, the hunting knife raised high, about to come down when the bloody young wolf suddenly struggled fiercely. The hunter, distracted for a moment, let it escape.</p><p>The crowd immediately scattered like birds and beasts, fleeing in all directions as the hunter chased after him with his knife, yelling, “Where are you running, you beast?!”</p><p>The young wolf limped away, suddenly meeting Jiang Juan’s gaze. Without hesitation, it pursued him and then leaped forward with great effort!</p><p>"Protect the Prince! Protect the Prince!"</p><p>High Official Shi was taken aback, quickly shouting for help. The guards swiftly drew their swords, forcefully slashing them onto the ground. At the same time, Jiang Juan felt something splash onto his face, warm and sticky.</p><p>"This beast," High Official Shi approached, kicking the wolf pup several times, "really has no sense."</p><p>The hunter carrying his knife rushed over. Upon seeing High Official Shi, he recognized that this was the carriage of the Prince's mansion and immediately dropped his hunting knife in fright, making a clatter.</p><p>The hunter immediately knelt down, bowing towards the carriage, "Prince, forgive me! Prince, forgive me! This subject failed to keep an eye on this beast, allowing it to collide with you. I will chop it up right now as reparation!"</p><p>After speaking, the hunter trembled as he picked up his knife. Xue Fangli said nothing and made no attempt to stop him, only watching indifferently.</p><p>The hunter had no idea if Prince Li would spare him after killing the beast, but he knew that not doing so would certainly mean a severe punishment. Thus, gritting his teeth, he swung hard—</p><p>"Don't!" Jiang Juan quickly intervened, startling the hunter who instinctively stopped his hand. Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "It didn't intend to hurt anyone just now; its teeth and claws are all broken…"</p><p>Thinking back on the wolf pup's tearful gaze, Jiang Juan felt an overwhelming sense of pain. He braced himself and asked Xue Fangli, "Could you spare it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent.</p><p>Interesting, truly interesting.</p><p>Young Master Jiang Nian, cherished in Secretary Jiang's hands, had certainly put a lot of thought into things. On the other hand, this youngest son, Jiang Juan, who was not favored, had developed a heart as pure and kind as that of a Bodhisattva.</p><p>In the midst of silence, High Official Shi pretended to focus on his nose, but inwardly muttered viciously.</p><p>What were they doing?</p><p>Was Third Young Master really taking our Prince for such a great benefactor?</p><p>The last person who dared to plead for mercy ended up being punished collectively.</p><p>Truly, he knew not his place in the world.</p><p>"…Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn’t even realize how soft her voice had become.</p><p>Xue Fali finally lifted his eyelids.</p><p>A bloodstain fell on Jiang Juan’s face, a bright red spot like a cherry blossom in winter snow, as vivid as the dawn of spring. Jiang Juan was originally as ethereal as smoke and clouds, but this splash of vibrant color dragged him into the mortal world, leaving only brilliance in sight.</p><p>And behind his clear gaze lay entreaty, no longer devoid of desire.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>It was unclear how much time had passed before Xue Fali finally spoke, his smile enigmatic and unpredictable.</p>
