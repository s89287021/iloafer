						<p>Fact proves that being a person is truly not easy.</p><p>Jiang Juanren was still in shock, while Xue Fangli had already leaned in to kiss him. Given his words, Jiang Juan rarely refused to be kissed and kept pushing Xue Fangli with her hands, but she couldn't budge him at all.</p><p>"We should talk properly; you shouldn’t... use your hands..."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to struggle, Xue Fangli laughed, easily catching both of Jiang Juan's hands and pressing them above. He idly asked, "What is there to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juan feigned composure as she replied, "Anything can be said. During the days I was unconscious, besides worshipping the Buddha statue, did you do anything else?"</p><p>She tried to change the subject in a rather awkward manner, Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan but used his free hand to remove her hairpin.</p><p>Her black hair fell around the young man's neck, she was lost and innocent as she lay on the soft bed, her breath sweet and pure.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised Jiang Juan's chin and kissed her.</p><p>This time was different, after all danger loomed, Jiang Juan clenched her lips tightly, afraid of being kissed senseless, but no matter how tight she clamped her mouth shut, Xue Fangli found a way to pry it open.</p><p>His lips and tongue traced over Jiang Juan's soft lips, wet and scorching, followed by gentle friction, intimate grinding, tender to the extreme, even slightly ticklish.</p><p>Jiang Juan subconsciously licked.</p><p>That was enough for Xue Fangli to slip in.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Regret was useless now, Jiang Juan's hands were held down, and her chin lifted lightly. She was forced to accept the invasion of tongues in her mouth, forced to accept Xue Fangli’s possession.</p><p>Soon, Jiang Juan's gaze softened.</p><p>Xue Fali did not kiss him anymore and sat up.</p><p>The restraints were removed, Jiang Juan's hands regained their freedom. He was no longer forced to endure that insatiable demand, yet Jiang Juan could not continue either.</p><p>"I still want to kiss you."</p><p>Jiang Juan enjoyed kissing; for him, it was the best way to express his affection, and he found great joy in doing so.</p><p>Xue Fali refused, saying calmly, "Didn't you want to know what I did while you were unconscious?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>"I've changed my mind. I don't want to know anything about it now."</p><p>"I want to tell you."</p><p>This naughty person was deliberately doing this.</p><p>He slowly got up and thought for a moment before straddling him and looking up at Xue Fali, asking, "You really don't want to kiss me anymore?"</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan licked his lips.</p><p>His lip color was very light, so even one kiss would make them turn red quite noticeably. After being kissed for so long, Jiang Juan's lips were now a soft shade of red and even glistened slightly, resembling rose petals wet with morning dew, faintly emitting a fragrant aroma.</p><p>Xue Fali knew all too well how sweet the young man's lips were.</p><p>He looked down at him but did not respond. Jiang Juan had no choice but to lean in himself, mimicking Xue Fali's earlier actions and rubbing against his lips repeatedly.</p><p>Xue Fali still showed no reaction.</p><p>After putting in a great effort, Jiang Juan was exhausted. He felt that Xue Fangli was really inhumane; he had insisted on kissing him, but had left after only half of it, showing a very malicious heart.</p><p>However, no matter how malicious Xue Fangli was, now it was Jiang Juan who was seeking the kiss.</p><p>After staring at Xue Fangli for a long time, Jiang Juan lowered his head and grabbed one of Xue Fangli's hands. He played with the other person’s fingers, submitting, "As long as you kiss me, I'll let you do whatever you want."</p><p>"But... if it hurts too much, we won't continue."</p><p>Jiang Juan added anxiously.</p><p>He said those words, but Jiang Juan was truly embarrassed. After saying them, he dared not raise his head; his eyelashes lightly fell, while his heart pounded wildly.</p><p>After waiting for a long time, Xue Fangli still didn't speak. Jiang Juan looked up curiously and met his dark eyes, filled with desire that almost frightened Jiang Juan.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>His heartbeat skipped a beat, and Jiang Juan felt somewhat regretful. At the same time, he was tightly grabbed by the waist, and Xue Fangli lowered his head to ask him, "Do you want me to do whatever I want?"</p><p>After all this, he still asked again. Jiang Juan didn't want to answer and choked out, "You talk so much, are you incapable?"</p><p>Daring to stoke the fire at such a moment, Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan with a smile that was hard to discern, his voice hoarse, "You'll find out if I'm capable in a moment."</p><p>The next instant, Jiang Juan was pushed back onto the soft bed again, and Xue Fangli leaned in for another kiss.</p><p>In a daze, his belt was pulled open, and his clothes scattered on the floor.</p><p>...</p><p>That day, Xue Fangli practically proved his capability with his actions.</p><p>Jiang Juan realized that he had thought himself bullied terribly before, but compared to today, it was nothing. When Xue Fangli truly bullied him, Jiang Juan could only lie in his arms, sobbing and biting his shoulder.</p><p>On that day, Jiang Juan also cried for a long time.</p><p>He had always been very afraid of pain, and this time he was truly in agony. Jiang Juan nearly broke down; his eyes were red from crying, and even the tips of his fingers, which clutched the thin blanket, were severely reddened.</p><p>Finally, with tears in his eyes and his voice choked up, Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "You just want to torture me to death."</p><p>At first, he didn't plan on breaking up with Xue Fangli; it was just that Jiang Juan took the initiative but was tormented too much. In the end, Jiang Juan really didn't want to break up with Xue Fangli.</p><p>After everything was over, when Xue Fangli picked Jiang Juan up again, Jiang Juan had formed a conditioned reflex. He was frightened, his eyelashes twitching in fear, and his whole body was filled with resistance. "Get away from me."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and asked, "What are you afraid of?"</p><p>How dare he even ask! Jiang Juan pursed his lips, turned his head, and didn't want to respond to him. Xue Fangli smiled and, almost mockingly, asked, "Are you afraid that I'll hug you again—"</p><p>"Don't say it."</p><p>Jiang Juan hastily covered Xue Fangli's mouth, nearly furious with embarrassment.</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly. His dark hair was disheveled, his lips a bright red. Under the vivid colors, his skin looked extremely pale, but there was no trace of illness between his eyebrows; only endless joy and satisfaction.</p><p>He was indeed satisfied, while Jiang Juan felt drained.</p><p>After all, he had been overworked.</p><p>"Just hugging you for a bath, what were you thinking about?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head to kiss Jiang Juan's eyelashes. Jiang Juan was truly being bullied too much and overly indulged; water vapor still clung to his face, which was so vividly beautiful that it was breathtaking, drooping like a wilted peach blossom petal.</p><p>"You said it would just be a bath, no other things."</p><p>Jiang Juan solemnly emphasized again, but his voice still carried a hint of tears and lacked any intimidation.</p><p>Now moving on to the next phase, let's have the senior proofreader edit this draft.</p><p>On that day, Jiang Juan cried for a long time.</p><p>He had always been very afraid of pain, and this time he was truly in agony. Jiang Juan nearly broke down; his eyes were red from crying, and even the tips of his fingers, which clutched the thin blanket, were severely reddened.</p><p>Finally, with tears in his eyes and his voice choked up, Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "You just want to torture me to death."</p><p>At first, he didn't plan on breaking up with Xue Fangli; it was just that Jiang Juan had taken the initiative but was tormented too much.

He had always been extremely afraid of pain, and this time it was truly unbearable. Jiang Juan nearly collapsed; his eyes were red from crying, and even the tips of his fingers, which clutched the thin blanket, turned bright red.</p><p>Finally, with tears streaming down his face and his voice choked up, Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "You just want to torture me to death."</p><p>At first, he hadn't intended to break up with Xue Fangli; it was just that Jiang Juan had taken the initiative but ended up being tormented too much. In the end, Jiang Juan truly didn't want to be with Xue Fangli anymore.</p><p>After everything was over, when Xue Fangli picked Jiang Juan up again, Jiang Juan instinctively reacted out of fear. His eyelashes twitched, and his whole body bristled with resistance. "Get away from me."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and asked, "What are you afraid of?"</p><p>How dare he ask! Jiang Juan pursed his lips, turned his head, and refused to respond. Xue Fangli smiled mockingly and asked, "Are you afraid I'll hug you again—"</p><p>"Don't say it."</p><p>Jiang Juan hastily covered Xue Fangli's mouth, nearly enraged with humiliation.</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly. His dark hair was disheveled, his lips a bright red. Under the vivid colors, his skin looked extremely pale, but there was no trace of illness between his eyebrows; only endless joy and satisfaction.</p><p>He was indeed satisfied, while Jiang Juan felt utterly drained.</p><p>After all, he had been overworked.</p><p>"Just hugging you for a bath—what were you thinking about?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head to kiss Jiang Juan's eyelashes. Jiang Juan was truly being bullied too much and overly indulged; water vapor still clung to his face, which was so vividly beautiful that it was breathtaking, drooping like a wilted peach blossom petal.</p><p>"You said it would just be a bath, nothing else."</p><p>Jiang Juan solemnly emphasized again, but his voice still carried a hint of tears and lacked any intimidation.</p><p>The new Emperor had no choice but to sleep alone for a few days.</p><p>This was tough on Manager Wang, who had to visit several times a day and inquire about the situation.</p><p>Had the new Empress calmed down?</p><p>Would the new Empress return to the palace?</p><p>Would the new Emperor continue to endure sleeping alone?</p><p>Five days later, Jiang Juan finally calmed down and was ready to return to the palace.</p><p>Before leaving, he first visited Bai Xue Chao and then specially went to apologize to Dr. Hua Shenshi.</p><p>At that time, Dr. Hua Shenshi was fishing. Seeing Jiang Juan arrive, he hurriedly put down his fishing rod and tried to bow to him, but Jiang Juan stopped him, "It's not necessary."</p><p>Dr. Hua Shenshi did not refuse; instead, he stood up and looked at Jiang Juan, understandingly asking, "Are you returning to the palace?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and reluctantly said, "He is waiting for me."</p><p>"It's good that you're returning home soon," Dr. Hua Shenshi nodded, "You shouldn't pretend to be ill in the future; it's not auspicious."</p><p>Since he had brought up the matter, Jiang Juan sheepishly said, "I am really sorry about what happened that day."</p><p>"I was too eager back then and forgot to have someone announce my arrival before I barged right in."</p><p>After apologizing to himself, Jiang Juan also did not forget Xue Fangli. He explained to Dr. Hua Shenshi, "He — the Emperor — is partly to blame as well. Every time I encounter something I don't want to do, I pretend to have a heart attack, but there are too many things I don't like to do, so it happens quite frequently..."</p><p>Jiang Juan's voice grew softer as he spoke, "He has always been very concerned about me, so when he heard you were here, he immediately came over and was not very polite to you..."</p><p>Not only was it impolite. Xue Fangli even got his hands dirty.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered her head, feeling quite guilty. After all, Dr. Hua Shenyi was a good friend of Bai Xuechao and had specially traveled to the capital city. Yet, they ended up causing such a commotion, which looked very bad.</p><p>"Empress, please rest assured and do not blame yourself."</p><p>After hearing Jiang Juan's words, Dr. Hua Shenyi smiled gently and said, "Actually, it is also my fault. At first, I did not know Your Majesty's identity. I just thought he was difficult to deal with and did not want any trouble. So, I made an excuse by saying that heart disease could not be cured in me, and that he should prepare a coffin for himself. After hearing this, Your Majesty became extremely angry."</p><p>At this point, Dr. Hua Shenyi shook his head and continued, "Besides, Your Majesty has already apologized to the two of you on my behalf."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, "Ah," as she was unaware of this matter and was quite surprised.</p><p>Dr. Hua Shenyi sighed contentedly, "Not only did Your Majesty give me many valuable medicinal herbs, but also presented me with several nice things, enough for me to make a profit for some time. I wish the Empress would cause trouble again so that Your Majesty could lift me up once more."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt relieved seeing that Dr. Hua Shenyi was not too bothered about it. He came here to apologize, and since everything was resolved, there was no need to stay any longer. She bid farewell to Dr. Hua Shenyi, "Then... I'll be leaving?"</p><p>Dr. Hua Shenyi nodded. However, after Jiang Juan took a few steps, he remembered something and called her back.</p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around, and Dr. Hua Shenyi smiled, "Originally, I did not want to come to the capital city because it was too far away. Besides, it is summer now, with plenty of rain and a lot to do."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not understand why he said this and was taken aback. She asked Dr. Hua Shenyi, "Then why did you come to the capital city?"</p><p>"Because of you."</p><p>Dr. Hua Shenyi bowed politely to Jiang Juan and explained, "Every summer, southern regions are prone to heavy rainfall. In good fortune, only a few villages would be washed away; in bad luck, not just villages but vast tracts of farmland would flood. Therefore, every summer, I travel around to treat villagers."</p><p>"The rain this year in the south is actually much heavier than usual years. If it were not for the Empress, many places in the south might have suffered disasters, and I certainly could not spare time to come to the capital city. At present, I am traveling all over the place."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not understand, and he asked in confusion: "Ah? The south has not been affected by the disaster, what does it have to do with me?"</p><p>Doctor Shensi praised: "Her Highness truly has a keen eye for talent. Discovering Mr. Xie at the Imperial Stud Farm and repeatedly recommending him is how Mr. Xie came down to the south to manage the flood control."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned and then realized that the Mr. Xie he mentioned was Xie Bailu.</p><p>Jiang Juan stammered: "I just... happened to be there by chance?"</p><p>Doctor Shensi waved his hand, "Her Highness need not be modest. Your heart is concerned for the country, your sense of justice is profound, this is a blessing for our Great Revival!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could he explain this?</p><p>He couldn't explain it at all!</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p><p>Doctor Shensi continued: "So Brother Bai said that Her Highness needed me, I immediately rushed to the capital city to repay Her Highness with whatever little help I could offer."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, never expecting this reason. After a long while, he said: "You ran all this way for nothing."</p><p>Doctor Shensi said: "It's not for nothing, as long as you're fine."</p><p>Jiang Juan thanked him again before leaving the Prince's Mansion.</p><p>Outside the mansion, the carriage had been waiting for a long time. Manager Wang was looking around nervously. Seeing Jiang Juan come out, his eyes lit up, and he rushed over to help him.</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, indicating that he didn't need help, and climbed in himself.</p><p>As soon as Jiang Juan entered the carriage, he was pulled into an embrace. He knew who it was without looking. Jiang Juan sat down slowly and said: "You actually apologized to Doctor Shensi on your own."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke in a calm tone, "You should at least accumulate some merit for yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and looked at Xue Fangli without speaking.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered her eyes and asked, "Going back?"</p><p>Although Jiang Juan was still irritated, upon seeing Xue Fangli, he tried to maintain his cold demeanor. However, the moment their eyes met, he couldn't help but smile.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes curved gently, and his soft lips curled up as well. He grabbed Xue Fangli's fingers, his gaze sparkling with excitement, "Yeah, let's go home."</p>
