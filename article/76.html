						<p>This kiss felt too unfamiliar.</p><p>He acted like a little animal, only pressing himself against Jiang Juan and licking with his tongue. When his eyelashes fluttered, they were surprisingly soft.</p><p>Xue Fangli let him kiss—or rather, allowed him to keep pressing against him—until Jiang Juan thought it was enough. Then, his slender fingers pressed against the back of his head, not allowing Jiang Juan to pull away.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Jiang Juan called out to him, his voice slightly muffled. As soon as he opened his mouth, Xue Fangli's lips and tongue snuck in again. The kiss that had just ended was brutal, scaring Jiang Juan terribly.</p><p>He shook his head fiercely, trying to push back with his soft hands. Xue Fangli lowered his head, his eyes filled with ferocity. "What? You don't want to be kissed anymore?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan was like Wang Wei—unaware of danger but deftly resolving everything. He seemed to be pleading or teasing as he said in a sticky-sweet voice, "Prince, be gentler; don't hurt me anymore."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent and looked at him for a long time before leaning in again to kiss. Without an answer, Jiang Juan didn't dare let him kiss him. He stretched out his hand and pressed it against Xue Fangli's lips, nervously saying, "Promise me first."</p><p>Only after receiving his promise did he allow himself to be kissed. Water marks spread across his face as lantern light flickered, the firelight dim and stunningly beautiful, like a dawn in spring.</p><p>His Adam's apple moved as Xue Fangli muttered an "hm." However, his grip on Jiang Juan's wrist was far from gentle.</p><p>With both hands forcefully pressed against the artificial mountain, Xue Fangli kissed fiercely. Jiang Juan felt he had been fooled again, but when his tongue probed once more, Xue Fangli kept his promise.</p><p>Unlike before, where it felt like an invasion, this time it was as if he were simply tasting him. His tongue danced around, even wrapping occasionally, their hot breaths mingling and becoming wet.</p><p>Jiang Juan was almost unable to stand from the kiss; his limbs were growing weak, and the hard stones behind him pressed painfully against him. Yet, he rarely complained.</p><p>The Prince wasn't being fierce anymore; he liked this kiss.</p><p>It's impossible to say how long it lasted, but after the kiss ended, Jiang Juan panted as he lifted his head. His eyes were filled with moisture, and his pale lips were kissed to a deep red, still damp from where Xue Fangli had touched him, making him look like a wet and wilted hawthorn flower petal that could squeeze out juice with just a little force.</p><p>This kiss felt too unfamiliar.</p><p>He behaved like a small animal, merely pressing himself against Jiang Juan and licking his tongue. When his eyelashes fluttered, they were surprisingly soft.</p><p>Xue Fangli let him press or rather, allowed him to keep rubbing against him until Jiang Juan thought it was enough.

His eyes were filled with moisture, and his pale lips were kissed to a deep red, still damp from where Xue Fangli had touched him, making him look like a wet and wilted hawthorn flower petal that could squeeze out juice with just a little force.</p><p>He was made to cry again.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What is this?"</p><p>He stretched his hand towards Jiang Juan. At the fingertips, the water spread out, sparkling.</p><p>"It's not tears, what is this of yours?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Whatever it isn't again."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Once at the tavern, twice just now, which time did you not cry?"</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled to say, "At the tavern, it wasn't because you made me cry."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Then why did you cry?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment but still decided to defend himself, "I was just thinking about whether Your Highness would be around after&#59103;&#8204;, and what I should do."</p><p>Xue Fangli was stunned. "Worried about this King?"</p><p>Jiang Juan still felt embarrassed. He couldn’t say he was worried, so he changed the topic in an unnatural way, "I don't want to be a widow for now."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and after a long silence, his lips curled slightly as he said slowly, "Coincidentally, this King also doesn't wish to be a widower for now."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head and started playing with Xue Fangli’s fingers. He didn’t speak again, and Xue Fangli remained silent too, but the atmosphere was subtle and charged.</p><p>Should I say something?</p><p>What should I say?</p><p>"My Lord, take care of yourself."</p><p>No.</p><p>It sounds like a dedicatory phrase.</p><p>He needs to say something else.</p><p>"My Lord, I..."</p><p>"Do you find me pleasing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, and his breathing paused. He subconsciously fiddled with Xue Fangli's fingers for a long time before slowly shaking his head, "I don't seem to find you pleasing."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly and casually asked Jiang Juan, "Don't you have anything else to say to this Lord?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said uncertainly, "Yes?"</p><p>He lowered his head again, his eyelashes fluttering. After a long while, he very softly asked, "Then... My Lord, am I now your Consort?"</p><p>Before, he had only been going through the motions, but now he truly wanted to be this Lord's Consort.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Not yet."</p><p>Jiang Juan was bewildered, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not explain to him and merely embraced Jiang Juan, pulling him back into his arms. Jiang Juan obediently leaned against his shoulder before burying his face in Xue Fangli's chest as he heard Xue Fangli say, "Do you find me pleasing? Just one sentence that seems like you don't?"</p><p>Jiang Juan forced a calm expression, "... Then what else?"</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled lightly, "Are you willing to kiss this Lord?"</p><p>Certainly because—</p><p>it was for the Prince.</p><p>He liked to give it to the Prince.</p><p>And he… also liked the Prince.</p><p>But Jiang Juan couldn't bring himself to say it. After much thought, he came up with a compromise. Jiang Juan lifted his head, his eyes sparkling, "You are my husband; if I don't kiss you, should I kiss Duke Ping of An?"</p><p>"……"</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped in his tracks, half-smiling and said, "You really know how to bring up an uncomfortable topic."</p><p>Feeling ashamed, Jiang Juan quickly hid in his arms. Xue Fangli embraced him for a moment before casually added, "His Majesty will give you more time to think about what exactly you should say."</p><p>As long as he wasn't pressured, anything was fine. Jiang Juan said, "Oh," sounding like a little owl.</p><p>The Prince had clearly stated it.</p><p>Why did he still need to hear him say it out loud?</p><p>Couldn't he just understand it?</p><p>Jiang Juan silently complained in his heart.</p><p>The Prince is so troublesome.</p><p>Yangxin Hall.</p><p>It was already quite late, but the Yangxin Hall remained brightly lit.</p><p>Emperor Xing coughed incessantly. Master Wang stood behind him, worryingly patting his back several times until Emperor Xing waved at him to stop. Only then did Master Wang retreat to the side.</p><p>"You three, I rely on you most."</p><p>Emperor Xing blinked and cast his gaze over Jiang Sen Tao, Gu Yunzhi, and Su Feiyue in turn, speaking weakly, "One is my general, one is my chancellor, and as for you... Su Feiyue, I regret it until this day."</p><p>"I understand that you do not wish to serve the court because of some unresolved grudge," Emperor Xing sighed. "That year, it almost cost your life in Lingnan, a brush with death, hanging by a thread, from then on, no more inquiries about the court, even your master Bai Xuezhao became disheartened and resigned, all my fault."</p><p>He heaved a sigh of regret, "My carelessness led to the loss of two loyal subjects!"</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled as if it was of no concern, "Your Majesty, this has already been going on for too long. I have long forgotten these matters and any grudges. It is just that being scolded by a horse is easy, I do not wish to rise early and stay up late anymore."</p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing, "These years, I have done well indeed, with plenty of free time. Whenever I am free, I often travel and enjoy the mountains and rivers with Fu Ying. Generals Jiang and Chancellor Gu are no doubt envious."</p><p>Emperor Xing shook his head, only to smile bitterly, "... Prince Li's temperament differs from mine; I am indecisive, but he is not. Since you say you have forgotten it all, then assist Prince Li in the future."</p><p>He finally got to the main point, glancing at the other two, Emperor Xing said slowly, "My mind is set, I shall appoint Prince Li as Crown Prince."</p><p>"Your Majesty! This must not be!"</p><p>Gu Yunzhi's eyelids twitched when he heard this, frowning and speaking out.</p><p>Emperor Xing had always intended to appoint Prince Li as Crown Prince. He had mentioned it before as well; at that time, Su Feiyue was not present, but Jiang Sen Tao was there. His views were the same as Gu Yunzhi's.</p><p>Prince Li's temperament was tyrannical and unsuitable for being a monarch.</p><p>Back then, they both worked together to dissuade Emperor Xing from this idea, knowing it was only temporary since he could not control Emperor Xing's will, hoping to delay it one day at a time.</p><p>But this time, what surprised Gu Yunzhi was that only he was attempting to persuade Emperor Xing. As for Su Feiyue and Jiang Sen Tao, they stood there without any intention of trying to convince Emperor Xing to change his mind.</p><p>Gu Yunzhi: "???"</p><p>Sophie Yue was set aside, Gu Yunzhi asked Jiang Sen Tao, "General Jiang, do you... have any new ideas recently?"</p><p>Gu Yunzhi: "... "</p><p>The change in Jiang Sen Tao's attitude was too great, making Gu Yunzhi puzzled. He turned to ask Sophie Yue, "Shuai Ma, do you also think the Prince is good?"</p><p>Sophie Yue smiled and said, "The Prince indeed has the ability for such a grand role. His talent far surpasses mine and yours; he just doesn't like to show it. In the past, the Prince was free from entanglements, but now that he has... restrictions, he becomes an excellent choice."</p><p>"Restrictions?"</p><p>Gu Yunzhi was puzzled, yet Jiang Sen Tao nodded in agreement, leaving him even more confused, "What kind of restrictions?"</p><p>Sophie Yue smiled again, "General Gu is truly busy with his duties, isn't he?"</p><p>He didn't beat around the bush, "His restriction is that very Princess."</p><p>"The Princess is kind-hearted, and the Prince has been quite indulgent. As a result, the Prince no longer acts without method or according to his moods as before."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi was indeed busy recently and was shocked by what he heard.</p><p>Emperor Hong Xing was also surprised. He had expected all three of them to try to dissuade him, but before he knew it, only Gu Yunzhi remained with his reservations.</p><p>This was actually good, Emperor Hong Xing was pleased about it.</p><p>Sophie Yue was right; this kingdom belonged to him, and who the Crown Prince would be naturally depended on whom Emperor Hong Xing favored. However, Emperor Hong Xing's repeated inquiries were just hoping that these three would be devoted assistants to Xue Fangli in the future.</p><p>Emperor Hong Xing said contentedly, "Indeed, with this Wangfei, Old Five has truly changed his character."</p><p>"Since you have no objections either, let it be so."</p><p>Sophie Yue and Jiang Sen Tao naturally had no objection, but Gu Yunzhi was filled with worry. However, he did not want to express his concerns openly, so he could only bow along with Sophie Yue and Jiang Sen Tao, saying, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Emperor Xingxing waved his hand weakly, dismissing him. "I have no more heart for this. You may all go."</p><p>After performing their bowing ceremony, the group walked out of the Yangxin Pavilion together. Gu Yunzhi was still deeply worried, while Sophie Yue smiled and said, "Premier Gu, stop worrying. If you do not believe me or General Jiang, feel free to visit Prince Wang and Princess Consort Wang in your spare time."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi replied in a perfunctory manner, "Mingbai. I will pay them a visit when I have the time."</p><p>Just because they meet once will change their intentions?</p><p>He did not think so.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell asleep in the carriage right after getting in. He slept soundly and remained undisturbed even as he was held all the way.</p><p>Xue Fangli placed him on the bed, while Lan Ting brought a basin of hot water and helped Jiang Juan wash his face. Xue Fangli stood by the bedside for a moment before leaving.</p><p>Outside Liuyoung Courtyard, there was a pavilion.</p><p>Wisteria vines covered the entire pavilion, cascading like waterfalls. Xue Fangli coldly brushed away the fallen flowers and sat inside the pavilion.</p><p>Soon after, Gao Jiang arrived with wine and cups.</p><p>He was quite puzzled. Ever since Princess Consort Wang moved into Liuyoung Courtyard, Prince Wang seemed to have stopped suffering from insomnia and always stayed by her side. It was unusual for him today.</p><p>After all, it is the son's affection. No matter how strange it may seem, Gao Jiang did not dare to voice his thoughts. He poured the wine fully as instructed. Xue Fangli lifted his cup, gazing at it intently for a long time without taking even a sip, his expression one of deep contemplation.</p><p>"Gaode."</p><p>High Official "Ah" said, "Your Highness, what's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fanglei spoke calmly, "Go ahead and say... does the Princess Consort like this Wang?"</p><p>The high official was stunned. He cautiously replied, "Does liking Your Highness make one a good person?"</p><p>Xue Fanglei closed his eyes slightly, "According to you, am I a good person?"</p><p>The high official: "... "</p><p>Before the Princess Consort married into the Li Manor, everyone in the entire manor lived in fear. After all, the Wang's madness was truly terrifying. He certainly couldn't be considered a good person.</p><p>But after the Princess Consort arrived, the Wang did indeed restrain himself quite a bit. He even made an effort to play the part of a good person in front of the Princess Consort. However, this act was only for her benefit; he still wasn't a good person.</p><p>The high official was sly. He flattered, "Whether Your Highness is a good person or not isn't important. As long as the Princess Consort thinks you are a good person, then you are."</p><p>Xue Fanglei laughed, his tone mocking, "Are you going to hide it for your entire life?"</p><p>The high official didn't dare speak anymore. After some time, Xue Fanglei slowly said, "What if it can't be hidden? What if he discovers... that this Wang is not good?"</p><p>The high official was stunned again. After a while, he whispered, "The Princess Consort and Your Highness are inseparable every day. Your Highness has punished many people for the Princess Consort's sake, and there have certainly been deaths. The Princess Consort should know to some extent... more or less who kind of person Your Highness is."</p><p>"He doesn't know."</p><p>Xue Fanglei lowered his eyelids, "This Wang has never let him know about the bloodshed."</p><p>Jiang Juan was present, he would never use extreme measures; he wouldn't even do it himself. But when Jiang Juan wasn't around, there were a thousand ways to torture someone—cutting tongues, gouging eyes... In his subconscious, Jiang Juan couldn't accept these cruel actions. He would even be startled by his own brutality.</p><p>Love breeds worry and fear1.</p><p>At first, he simply felt the meaning of it; he had never received such trust from anyone before. He didn't mind playing along with Jiang Juan to pretend to be a good person. Whether Jiang Juan discovered the truth or not was irrelevant to him; he even found it amusing to speculate about his reaction.</p><p>Now he only felt panic.</p><p>Perhaps he could hide for a long time, or perhaps not very long. He was afraid that Jiang Juan would be frightened, and also afraid that Jiang Juan would…</p><p>Fear him.</p><p>The night wind blew, the wisteria flowers rustled softly, petals falling to the ground, gently drifting into the cup. Schue Fangli’s dark robes billowed in the wind, but his expression remained silent.</p><p>With a thud, he put down the wine cup, not taking a sip, and turned to leave.</p><p>He hesitated for a long time, finally sighing.</p><p>I don’t quite know what the Empress Dowager would think, but there was one thing he knew very clearly.</p><p>He, Lord Wang, was truly in love.</p>
