						<p>That night.</p><p>After the banquet, outside the Princess Chang's residence, carriages were as numerous as flowing water and horses like dragons.</p><p>The carriage of the Shang family had not yet departed, stopping in a dimly lit area.</p><p>Duke Ping An strode over, passing one carriage after another, and then abruptly pulled back the curtain of a sedan chair.</p><p>Jiang Nian looked up, with someone wiping his forehead wound with a handkerchief. Seeing Duke Ping An, Jiang Nian dismissed the attendant and gazed at the duke, slightly moving his lips; however, nothing came out, only silent tears dropping.</p><p>"Little Nian, you have suffered wrong."</p><p>Duke Ping An frowned, gently taking his hand, "Today's events I am well aware of. King Li is truly too cruel!"</p><p>"I should have attended the banquet, but my uncle kept me in his room, so I did not participate. If I had been there, you would not have been so humiliated."</p><p>Jiang Nian shook his head as if indifferent to this humiliation, only saying softly, "Your Excellency, Princess Chang and her husband do not like me..."</p><p>"How can one gain their favor?"</p><p>Duke Ping An consoled him, "Your uncle and aunt simply lack interaction with you. You are good; if they could overcome any reservations and interact with you, they would certainly like you."</p><p>Jiang Nian bit his lip, "He... has had contact with my—"</p><p>His voice faltered as he recalled the moment at the banquet when someone forced him to bow his head onto the ground, a humiliation and pain that would stay with Jiang Nian for life.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his fists, took a deep breath, and stammered, "He has had contact with Princess Li. Today, seeing him once, I noticed how delighted Princess Chang was, and her husband seemed to be in high spirits with him, even blaming me for something."</p><p>"Your Excellency, am I truly inferior to him?"</p><p>Inside the carriage, the light was dim, Jiang Nian's voice choked up, his face streaked with tears, looking pitiful. Duke Ping An was about to respond when he suddenly recalled that boy crying.</p><p>Tears wetted his lashes, resembling jade petals glistening with dew. Every flutter of his lashes sent a pang to his heart.</p><p>Jiang Nian truly could not compare to Jiang Juan.</p><p>"...Houye?"</p><p>No response for a long time. Jiang Nian softly called out to him, and Anping Hou finally managed to come back to his senses. He forced a smile, "How could you be like this?"</p><p>"You are who you are; there's no need to compare with others; don't worry too much."</p><p>Anping Hou did not give a direct answer, but Jiang Nian noticed something. A small porcelain bottle had been slipped into his hand. Anping Hou explained, "This is the rejuvenation ointment I begged from my aunt. Rest and recover at home for these few days. Remember to apply it once daily to avoid scarring."</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched the small porcelain bottle tightly, "...Okay."</p><p>Anping Hou said, "Regarding the banquet, Hou has already instructed everyone not to mention it, but... with so many guests, don't take anything that's said afterwards to heart."</p><p>Jiang Nian closed his eyes lightly and muttered, "I know."</p><p>How could he not know? Being punished so severely in front of everyone at the banquet would inevitably lead to countless rumors.</p><p>Then what? He had plenty of ways to stop the rumors; he had many methods to make people speak highly of Jiang Juan, the second son of Shangfu.</p><p>--In his previous life, this summer was far from peaceful.</p><p>Jiang Juan had Li Wang's protection, and both the Princess Dowager and the Chancellor cared for him. How so?</p><p>Not long after, not just the Princess Dowager and the Chancellor, even Emperor Hongxing would have shown some deference to him. He would continue as usual, trampling Jiang Juan underfoot mercilessly.</p><p>Thinking of this made Jiang Nian smile, his mind finally at peace.</p><p>He pretended to be indifferent, saying, "Houye, earlier you said that while the Princess Dowager and the Chancellor were away, you would enter the palace and request the Emperor to bestow a marriage upon me. Now that they have returned, my... marriage..."</p><p>Jiang Nian asked him, but it was just to see how Duke Ping would react. After all, he had already heard from Jiang Juan that the wedding gift had arrived. He endured silently that night not to make Duke Ping uncomfortable, as they were now inextricably linked.</p><p>Who knew that just as he finished speaking, Duke Ping shuddered and suddenly pulled away from Jiang Nian's hand, reacting dramatically.</p><p>"Your Excellency?"</p><p>Jiang Nian was utterly astonished. Duke Ping abruptly stood up and muttered vaguely, "…Something unexpected has happened."</p><p>He was panic-stricken. Jiang Nian thought that Duke Ping was embarrassed and sincerely wanted to give him a surprise, making his heart sweet with joy. He feigned tenderness, saying, "It's not about this, Your Excellency; there is plenty of time; we can take it slow."</p><p>Duke Ping nodded, avoiding eye contact, "It's getting late. You should go back and rest now."</p><p>"…Alright."</p><p>After their farewell, Duke Ping walked out. The coachman slapped the horse's back with a whip, the hooves clomping as the carriage drove away. Duke Ping watched the carriage disappear but remained motionless for a long time.</p><p>That day in the palace, he had not insisted on giving the wedding gift, thus missing a second chance.</p><p>How should he inform Jiang Nian of this?</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Outside the Wang Family Mansion.</p><p>In his own large bedroom, Jiang Juan slept until noon. He opened his eyes, feeling that he could still sleep for a while, turned over, and planned to change positions and continue sleeping, but as soon as he moved—</p><p>He couldn't move.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He reached out to feel something around his waist; a hand was constricting it. Jiang Juan pushed several times, not only failing to push away the hand but having his fingers grabbed instead. He could do nothing but open his eyes.</p><p>There was actually someone beside him.</p><p>"Who let you sleep here?" Jiang Juan raised her eyebrows.</p><p>"I wasn't allowed to sleep last night," Xue Fangli lay on the bed in his clothes, lazily grabbing Jiang Juan's hand. "Isn't it already daytime?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>"I didn't agree."</p><p>"Why does Wang Hui need your agreement to go back to his own courtyard?"</p><p>Jiang Juan deliberately looked at him with disdain: "Yeah, who gave me the right to meddle? I care about whether you laugh or not and who you meet, and when."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow slightly, tightened his hand on Jiang Juan's waist, pulled her into his arms, and let Jiang Juan rest against him. "Do you know what Auntie said about Wang?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had gotten used to being held by Xue Fangli and didn't struggle. Instead, upon hearing him say this, she placed both hands on his shoulders and looked up at him. "What did the Princess say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly: "She said—"</p><p>"It turned out that Wang is afraid of women."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, her hand went limp, and she tumbled into his arms.</p><p>Afraid of women.</p><p>What's so scary about being afraid of women?</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart pounded uncontrollably, beating rapidly. His chest pressed against hers, and the steady heartbeat he could hear beside her ear was in stark contrast to her own panic.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>He had kept his head down for too long, and the silence was oppressive. Xue Fangli asked in a calm tone, "Your Highness, why is your heartbeat so steady?" Jiang Juan only shook his head, his voice slightly muffled, "Your Highness, why is your heartbeat so steady?" He charged at him reasonably, "Can't it beat faster?" Xue Fangli said, "Lift your head." Jiang Juan said, "Huh?" Jiang Juan was somewhat bewildered. Someone suddenly pinched his chin, lifting his face. Then Jiang Juan's hand was pulled up and placed somewhere. Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "How about now?" Jiang Juan's eyelashes moved, he met Xue Fangli's gaze, still puzzled. Suddenly, the hand that had been lifted was placed on Xue Fangli's chest cavity, and he felt a thumping sensation. Thump, thump, thump. Not very strong, Jiang Juan's fingers trembled slightly. The heartbeat of the Your Highness seemed to have quickened, as if there was a heartbeat sound rushing into his ears. He couldn't distinguish whether it was his own or Xue Fangli's heartbeat, beating wildly one after another. At this moment, the four corners were silent, yet bustling with activity. They stared at each other intently. Xue Fangli's voice was low and deep, "You..." "Dong dong dong." Suddenly, a knocking sound rang out, and Jiang Juan was startled awake. He retracted his hand in one motion, his consciousness hiding away. That strange, thrilling feeling made him uneasy. Of course, no matter how he hid, he could only hide back into the man's embrace, unseen by others. "Come in."</p><p>Xue Fangli's face was stern as he bit out each word. Guan Xianyu, standing outside, could tell that Prince Wang was in a bad mood and couldn't help but shrink his neck slightly. He pushed his way in nervously and said, "P-P-Prince Wang..."</p><p>As he spoke, Guan Xianyu secretly glanced at the bed.</p><p>Prince Wang's concubine was lying in his arms, seemingly still asleep. Guan Xianyu lowered his voice, "Prince Wang, His Majesty went to the imperial stables today and suddenly had a lot of enthusiasm for organizing a horse riding competition. This is why he invited people into the palace."</p><p>"His Majesty wanted you and the concubine to go out for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan stopped pretending to be asleep. "I'm not going, I don't need a break, I feel fine."</p><p>Guan Xianyu was about to say something, but when Jiang Juan raised her head, he forgot what he was originally going to say and exclaimed in surprise, "Concubine, what's wrong with you? Are you running a fever?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>She touched her forehead, didn't feel hot, only looking at Xue Fangli curiously, asking him silently with her eyes what was going on. When Xue Fangli lowered his head, all the previous agitation dispersed, and he hugged Jiang Juan happily.</p><p>—the young man's eyelashes, shrouded in a rosy hue, seemed to have shattered the mundane world, beautiful beyond belief.</p><p>Guan Xianyu worriedly asked, "Prince Wang, should we call an imperial physician to check on the concubine?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's fingers moved slightly, gently caressing Jiang Juan's face. He said absentmindedly, "There's no need."</p><p>When Prince Wang says there's no need, Guan Xianyu didn't dare say much more and only asked, "Prince Wang, so... are we still going to the imperial stables?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't want to go, but Xue Fangli would have followed her wishes. Suddenly remembering something, he thought for a moment and said, "Of course, why not go."</p><p>"You can go by yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't need a break at all. She had already stated that if she was truly in a bad mood, sleeping would be her first choice; only when she couldn't sleep enough would it affect her mood. Jiang Juan firmly said, "Anyway, I'm not going."</p><p>"Yǐ," Xue Fangli smiled faintly, "What did I owe to Your Highness last night? Do you remember?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah? What did I owe..."</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Jiang Juan was startled. His body stiffened, and Xue Fangli said nonchalantly, "I said yesterday that I would do it today. Now that today has arrived, call me out, Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "......"</p><p>Husband.</p><p>How could he bring himself to say this?</p><p>Jiang Juan pursed his lips and tried to shirk the responsibility, "......Your Majesty."</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a forced smile, "Being petulant is not going to work."</p><p>"I am not being petulant."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his eyelashes, opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, but still could not bring himself to call him out.</p><p>Guan Chang looked at him and nearly gasped in surprise.</p><p>The Empress Consort was always beautiful, looking ethereal like an immortal, but now her eyes were moist, her face radiant, more beautiful than before. She could be described as stunningly gorgeous.</p><p>At the same time, Guan Chang finally realized something.</p><p>The Empress Consort wasn't actually sick.</p><p>She was just teased by His Majesty.</p><p>Such a little beauty had been reduced to this state by His Majesty's teasing. His Majesty really wasn't human.</p><p>"No, really no."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried again but failed. He plopped back into Xue Fangli's arms, his forehead resting on the man's shoulder, rubbing against it constantly. Xue Fangli gently patted him once and said, "Then let's go to the stables with Wang."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli slowly said, "I'll teach you how to ride a horse."</p><p>Jiang Juan had never ridden a horse before and was slightly curious. He asked Xue Fangli, "So if I go to the stables with you, can I stop shouting then?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and said, "Just delaying it by one day."</p><p>Jiang Juan grumbled, "My Lord, can't you be more magnanimous?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his lips, smiling without a trace of care, "No. Your Majesty isn't magnanimous to you either."</p><p>Jiang Juan had no choice but to crawl off him and recalled the plot.</p><p>After going through the part where the main character was humiliated at the Princess's residence, it was now the main character's lowest point. Many rumors about him would circulate in the capital, but there wasn't a major issue.</p><p>The main character's life was one of ups and downs. No matter how low he went, there was always a chance to turn things around. Moreover, he had his own group of companions.</p><p>There was also mention of a horse riding competition in the original text.</p><p>Xue Congjun, Jiang Qingliang, and Gu Puwang arrived at the stables. They were told about what happened at the Princess's residence and couldn't leave. Xue Congjun angrily let out his frustration, making sure no one dared to bring it up again.</p><p>However—</p><p>In the novel, Jiang Juan had already bitten his tongue to death, so whatever scolding the Princess and Commander-in-Chief gave the main character didn't concern him. However, now, the main character's humiliation last night was due to My Lord, the Princess, and the Commander-in-Chief acting on his behalf.</p><p>Would his companions intervene?</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned.</p><p>The previous interactions, although not intentional on Jiang Juan's part, he had found those people quite amusing. But that was before the main character became involved as a victim; now that it did involve the main character, shouldn't he turn against him? Jiang Juan sighed. It was a pity. He had finally caught a wild salted fish. "What are you thinking about?" Xue Fangli noticed Jiang Juan lost in thought and spoke with a faint tone. Jiang Juan responded absentmindedly, "...Gu Puwang." For a moment, his face was grabbed by someone, and Xue Fangli smiled dangerously, "What about him?" Jiang Juan was insensitive to the atmosphere, and this moment was no exception. He was unaware of the danger and simply lazily hugged Xue Fangli's neck, rubbing against him several times. "Your Majesty, I came with you, so..." "You need to take care of me; don't let anyone bully me." Especially Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang. Although he was unhappy when Jiang Juan mentioned Gu Puwang, the young man had approached proactively, softening up and flattering him to the greatest extent, greatly pleasing Xue Fangli. Xue Fangli closed his eyes slightly, "The King will take care of you." The youth seemed like porcelain, easily breakable. With a single moment of carelessness, he would shatter himself or get hurt, which was heartbreaking. But there was only one thing. Xue Fangli flicked his eyelashes, speaking with a relaxed tone, "When has the King ever let anyone bully you?" "If you're going to be the Queen, and you're afraid of being bullied, does that mean you won't be afraid only if you become an Empress?"</p>
