						<p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He was even more puzzled after hearing that, "Flatter me? What's there to flatter about?"</p><p>Bai Xue Chao explained, "With the new emperor ascended to the throne, the fiefs of all the princes and the promotions and placements of the concubines in the harem also need to be arranged. The new emperor... he has a temper that is hard to predict, so they came to you to plead their case. As for those who sent greeting cards, it's not just because they seek something from you, but also to plan for the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Ah," muttering, "So troublesome."</p><p>Bai Xue Chao waved his hand indifferently and said, "If my obedient grandson doesn't want to see them, then don't. Let them go talk to the new emperor themselves while you do what you like."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't want to see these people, after all, dealing with them was too troublesome. But he could let everyone else off, he still had to meet Xue Congjun.</p><p>Last night Jiang Juan wanted to comfort him, but Xue Congjun had already gone to sleep. Before coming back, Jiang Juan had been sleeping as well. Now that Xue Congjun had come over, of course Jiang Juan would take the opportunity to inquire about his wellbeing.</p><p>"Grandfather, I want to see Prince Liuyi."</p><p>"Then summon him in."</p><p>Bai Xue Chao patted his hand and Jiang Juan turned to the maid and said, "Could you please bring Prince Liuyi and Princess Ningtai in?"</p><p>The maid replied respectfully, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>The maid received her order and hurriedly walked out.</p><p>Outside Lingguang Pavilion, many people had gathered, eagerly awaiting a summons.</p><p>Among them, none were more anxious than Consort Mei and Crown Prince Xue Chaohua.</p><p>In the past, Lady Mei, acting as the custodian of the Phoenix Seal, was notorious for her arrogance and domineering behavior. Upon hearing that Jiang Juan was in Lingguang Hall, Lady Mei could not wait to tend to her own injuries and hastily had her maid assist her in coming over.</p><p>—Last time Emperor Hongxing fell ill, Lady Mei stirred up trouble in front of Empress Dowager, resulting in a punishment of fifty lashes. She has yet to fully recover from this injury.</p><p>However, upon receiving the news, and others hearing about it too, Lady Mei and Ningfei found themselves face-to-face unexpectedly.</p><p>"Sister, after all these days, your complexion...is still so poor?"</p><p>Xue Congjun tried to pull her back but failed. He scratched his head awkwardly, calling out as well, "…Empress Dowager Mei."</p><p>He had been too heartbroken yesterday and went to sleep early. When he returned to the palace, he was still in a funk when Empress Ningfei brought him out, saying it would be beneficial for him to meet with the new empress so that things could go better in the future.</p><p>If Xue Congjun were to say anything, he believed his mother's worries were unnecessary. His brother Jiang Juan would never torment people without reason, but since his mother insisted on coming, Xue Congjun had no choice but to follow her.</p><p>Lady Mei nodded and forced a smile, "It must be too hot out."</p><p>Empress Ningfei hurriedly responded, "Sister, your injuries are not yet healed. You should go back and rest quickly. Why are you still lingering here?"</p><p>She was clearly asking this rhetorical question, knowing very well what Lady Mei's intentions were. Upon hearing this, Lady Mei nearly gritted her teeth.</p><p>How could Empress Ningfei not know why she had come here?</p><p>It was to beg forgiveness from the new empress.</p><p>Wasn't that also the reason for Empress Ningfei's presence here?</p><p>In essence, they were both concubines of the late emperor. No matter how glorious their pasts had been, with Emperor Hongxing's passing, those good times were over. Their future happiness depended entirely on the mood of the new emperor and empress.</p><p>Things are different now compared to before. In the past, Lady Mei would have given Empress Ningfei a cold shoulder. Now, she could only say politely, "I've set up a banquet for the empress, hoping to invite her over for a conversation."</p><p>Empress Ningfei smiled and said, "Sister, what a coincidence. The lotus flowers at my place are in bloom. I also plan on inviting the empress to admire them."</p><p>They exchanged a smile, the atmosphere seeming peaceful. In reality, however, tension was brewing beneath the surface.</p><p>Empress Mei smiled and said, "Enjoying the flowers is delightful; there's an unmatched kind of pleasure in it."</p><p>Had Empress Dowager never seen lotus blossoms before? Was this mere pool of withered blooms worth admiring at all?</p><p>Princess Ning also remarked, "Sister, you always think of everything so considerately."</p><p>Had Empress Dowager never tasted good food before? Did she have to go out of her way just to attend your banquet?</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>After a while, the maid finally emerged and apologized, "Your Highnesses and Ladies, the Empress Dowager is unwell and cannot receive everyone."</p><p>This was an outright refusal.</p><p>Xue Congjun did not overthink it; after all, in such a setting, everyone was clearly there to forge connections. It was his elder brother's duty to avoid seeing any of them, otherwise trouble would abound in the future.</p><p>"Mother, let's go," Xue Congjun complained, "I told you already, we're coming back empty-handed."</p><p>"But whether it’s worth it or not, we have to try first."</p><p>Princess Ning shot him a glance; she still had to maintain appearances. She nodded at Empress Mei and then strolled away gracefully.</p><p>Since the Empress Dowager was unwell, there was no need for others to linger either. The officials who had sent their cards gradually dispersed. Despite how anxious Empress Mei and Xue Chaohua were, they could only return home.</p><p>Just as they took a few steps, the maid spoke again, "Prince Liuyi, please stay."</p><p>Xue Congjun was taken aback and turned around.</p><p>Actually, it wasn't just him. Turning around, he saw that the others hadn't gone far either and were all looking over. The maid whispered, "The Empress is feeling unwell and cannot enjoy the flowers. Please come in and sit with Consort Ning."</p><p>Xue Congjun hadn't reacted yet when Consort Ning immediately smiled and said hurriedly, "Then it will be quite an imposition on you."</p><p>She gently patted Xue Congjun, who finally came back to his senses.</p><p>Xue Congjun looked around, seeing envious glances everywhere. Admittedly, he felt rather pleased at that moment.</p><p>Juan Ge didn't see anyone and declined all invitations, but strangely enough, invited him and his stepmother to come in and sit for a while.</p><p>Xue Congjun laughed and walked briskly as if the wind was at his back.</p><p>"Alright, alright. I'm coming."</p><p>Xue Congjun's pride made Consort Ning feel delighted too, although she kept it more subdued, merely smiling and glancing sideways at Consort Mei before whispering, "Sister, your younger sister is going to sit with the Empress. Let's continue another day."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Consort Mei nodded with a smile as she watched Xue Congjun and Consort Ning enter Lingguang Pavilion. Her face was almost stiff from smiling, and her nails left many marks on her hands.</p><p>Almost forgetting that Prince Liuhou had been playing with the Empress since early morning, their relationship seemed to be quite good.</p><p>On the other hand, she had offended people repeatedly and now could only wait anxiously for punishment.</p><p>Consort Mei felt rather unjustified and cursed Xue Chaohua, "You useless thing, why don't you learn from your brother? He climbed up to the Empress so early!"</p><p>Xue Congjun was usually incompetent and received the most scolding every day. Today, however, it was unusual; after Consort Mei praised him, Consort Ning also smiled and patted his head, "Having a brain or not made no difference in the past, but you finally did something smart."</p><p>Xue Congjun felt sullen, "Mother, are you praising me or scolding me?"</p><p>Consort Ning thought back to Consort Mei's expression just then and her heart was filled with joy. She said wistfully, "Truly, fools have foolish blessings. You unfortunate child, sending my treasure to the Liufeng Mansion all day really brought you some fame."</p><p>A maid led Princess Ning and Xue Congyun into Lingguang Hall. The moment Xue Congyun saw Jiang Juan, she excitedly waved at him and shouted, "Big Brother Juan."</p><p>"Don't call me that," Princess Ning frowned, "It's not proper."</p><p>"It's fine," Jiang Juan winked, "He calls me this, and I'm used to it."</p><p>Since Jiang Juan didn't mind, Princess Ning said no more. However, seeing how close he was with Xue Congyun, she couldn't help but marvel at how lucky her foolish son really was.</p><p>Princess Ning smiled and greeted Bai Xueliang, "Mr. Bai."</p><p>Bai Xueliang nodded and began to chat with her.</p><p>Xue Congyun didn't need any pleasantries with Jiang Juan; he plopped down next to him and said gleefully, "Big Brother Juan, you really gave me face. You didn't see anyone else, just me."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied slowly, "... Meng Qingliang told me that you cried until you looked like a sad piglet. I wanted to see what a sad piglet looks like."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "?"</p><p>He immediately stopped smiling and curled his lip in anger, "What sad piglet? I think he's the one who should be called a piglet!"</p><p>Mentioning this made Xue Congyun think of Emperor Hongxing, which made her mood dip again. However, she understood Jiang Juan's intention, "Big Brother Juan, you're here to comfort me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Yes."</p><p>Xue Congyun was quite touched, "Big Brother Juan, y..."</p><p>Something seemed to occur to her as she paused.</p><p>"What?" Jiang Juan asked curiously.</p><p>"How about some substantial comfort?" Xue Congyun suggested cautiously.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "For example?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "Well... isn't Fifth Brother preparing for the coronation ceremony? When that time comes, the princes will also be enfeoffed with titles, and we'll be driven to our fiefs."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "And then?"</p><p>Xue Congjun rubbed her hands. "Brother Juan, please help me check it out."</p><p>"I want a fief close to the capital so I can come back to visit you from time to time. It also needs to be wealthy; otherwise, what will I eat and do for fun?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "What good does it do if you tell me all this?"</p><p>Xue Congjun flattered, "Please ask Fifth Brother about it. If he decides on a fief that's not suitable, you can give him some advice to help me out."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan honestly said, "I don't think I can influence him much."</p><p>Xue Congjun insisted, "You can do it!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "But..."</p><p>Seeing his hesitation, Xue Congjun asked softly, "Brother Juan, do you want to see me cry like a sad pig?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>Xue Congjun opened her mouth as if she were going to cry dramatically. Jiang Juan didn't really want to see that and after some internal conflict, he told Xue Congjun, "I can only ask him about it; I truly can't influence his decision."</p><p>Seeing that he was unwilling to push further, Xue Congjun agreed, "Alright, alright, alright."</p><p>It's good to plan ahead.</p><p>Xue Congyun thought about it more and more beautifully.</p><p>Leaning against Jang Juan, she really did enjoy the cool air.</p><p>When she arrived at Lingguang Palace, Xue Congyun was full of grievances. When she left Lingguang Palace, she was bouncing with energy. Just before leaving, she repeatedly reminded Jiang Juan, "Jiang Juan, remember to blow some pillow breeze!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Not long after Xue Congyun and Ningfei left, Baixue Chao also took his leave.</p><p>Baixue Chao smiled and said, "You too, get some rest early."</p><p>After seeing Baixue Chao off, Jiang Juan could finally go to sleep.</p><p>He was so exhausted that he fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a hand wrapped around his waist, pulling him into someone's embrace.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>This hug was too familiar; even with his eyes closed, Jiang Juan knew who it was. He softly called out.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and kissed his eyelashes, "Go back to sleep."</p><p>Before falling asleep, Jiang Juan was still thinking about Xue Congyun's instructions and mumbled, "Where is the fiefdom of the Sixth Prince located?"</p><p>Although Xue Fangli seemed busy, he knew exactly who Jiang Juan had seen and what Jiang Juan had done that day. He casually asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was in a state between sleep and wakefulness, mumbling, "He wants it to be closer to the capital and also a richer place."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh," her eyelashes twitching slightly. Well, if she couldn't sleep, then so be it; she was simply too exhausted to keep her eyes open and wanted nothing more than to continue sleeping.</p><p>But someone would not let her rest.</p><p>"Where's the pillow breeze?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his fingers rather roughly pinching a soft spot on Jiang Juan's face. Leaning in closer, he said with a sultry voice, "If I don't agree, will you not blow the pillow breeze for me?"</p><p>"Blow the pillow breeze for me nicely. If it pleases me, I'll allow anything."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh," her eyelashes twitching slightly. Well, if she couldn't sleep, then so be it; she was simply too exhausted to keep her eyes open and wanted nothing more than to continue sleeping.</p><p>But someone would not let her rest.</p><p>"Where's the pillow breeze?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his fingers roughly pinching a soft spot on Jiang Juan's face.

Well, if she couldn't sleep, then so be it; she was simply too exhausted to keep her eyes open and just wanted to continue sleeping.</p><p>But someone refused to let her rest.</p><p>"Where's the pillow breeze?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze, his fingers roughly pinching a soft spot on Jiang Juan's face. Leaning in closer, he said with a sultry voice, "If I don't agree, will you not blow the pillow breeze for me?"</p><p>"Blow the pillow breeze for me nicely. If it pleases me, I'll allow anything."</p>
