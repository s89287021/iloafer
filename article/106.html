						<p>Jiang Juan regretted it afterward.</p><p>Had he known that the consequence of being praised was to be stripped bare, he would have preferred to be fobbed off.</p><p>"Into your mouth, everything is 'can't be done.'"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke indifferently, showing no intention of letting Jiang Juan off.</p><p>The youth was trapped in the bed, with his black hair spread out and red clothes as fiery as fire, presenting a delightful sight. Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time before reaching up to unfasten his belt.</p><p>In the next second, the layered and intricate phoenix robe scattered, revealing a patch of pale skin, except for a bright red mole on the side of his neck that stood out brilliantly.</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled hard, "This outfit is so troublesome. I put so much effort into wearing it; why should you be able to take it off just like that?"</p><p>Xue Fangli leaned over and ran his fingers along the red mole, whispering in Jiang Juan's ear, "If I'm not allowed to touch it every day, shouldn't I at least get some sweet treats?"</p><p>"...I didn't refuse touching it."</p><p>Warm breath blew on him, making Jiang Juan feel itchy. He instinctively turned his head and accidentally pinched one of Xue Fangli's hands.</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli stopped teasing the mole and started tormenting Jiang Juan instead. He asked leisurely, "Why do you like pinching others' hands so much?"</p><p>The mention of pinching made Jiang Juan recall some very unpleasant memories, and he became furious with embarrassment, "Don't say that."</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed derisively, which only infuriated Jiang Juan even more, "You're so annoying."</p><p>At this point, there was no question of sweet treats; Jiang Juan truly didn't want to be touched anymore.</p><p>Jiang Juan was easily placated when angry. Acting pitiful or kissing him would make him forgive him instantly. At such a moment, Xue Fangli naturally chose the latter option. He pinched Jiang Juan's chin and kissed him gently.</p><p>Now, I'll pass this draft to the senior proofreading editor for further refinement.</p><p>At first, Jiang Juan was still in a bad mood and refused to cooperate with him. Xue Fangli didn't mind either; he simply parted his lips and deepened the kiss.</p><p>He knew Jiang Juan inside out, even better than Jiang Juan knew herself. Naturally, he knew what kind of kisses she enjoyed and which ones could make her listen to him.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan was softened by the kiss. Even if he didn't want to cooperate, he no longer had the strength to resist.</p><p>Until——</p><p>Unconsciously, the phoenix robe hanging loosely from him, creased under the pressure.</p><p>"No…"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>One hand pressed firmly against Jiang Juan's bare back, holding him close. Jiang Juan tried to maintain a bit of rationality, "Don't dirty the phoenix robe."</p><p>"It'll get dirty anyway."</p><p>Not wanting to hear Jiang Juan say no, Xue Fangli kissed him again. Unable to speak, Jiang Juan could only hold onto the hand that kept teasing him, shaking his head with wet eyes.</p><p>"Not… ready yet."</p><p>In between kisses, Jiang Juan panted out hoarsely, his voice barely audible.</p><p>"What??"</p><p>"The place… worn through last time."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his eyelashes, he was shy because he had never reached this point before. However, Jiang Juan knew that if he let it go, he would not accept it, and the outcome would definitely be the same as last time.</p><p>"And… in a few days, it will be the coronation ceremony. If I don’t walk properly, how can I even pretend to be human?"</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned, truly at a loss. Xue Fangli looked at him for a few seconds, and his rosy lips suddenly curled up, "Want to pretend to be human?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and whispered something in Jiang Juan’s ear. Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched, he stole a glance, and the light pink fingertips involuntarily curled up, "But… I can’t hold it."</p><p>"Use both hands together."</p><p>"……"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Unwilling?"</p><p>He laughed, his tone full of regret, "Then there’s no choice but to use you."</p><p>As he spoke, Xue Fangli kissed Jiang Juan while grabbing him to do mischief. A layer of mist slowly covered Jiang Juan’s eyes. He really didn’t want to embarrass himself, so in the end, he could only press that hand again and softly compromised with a voice filled with reluctance.</p><p>"I’ll help you, I’ll use my hands to help you."</p><p>To avoid embarrassing himself, Jiang Juan truly made an effort and paid the price of sore hands for several days.</p><p>By the time he had mostly recovered, it was also the day of the coronation ceremony.</p><p>That day, the sky was clear and bright.</p><p>Jiang Juan got up early, and Lan Ting dressed him in the phoenix robe.</p><p>—In recent days, Lan Ting had also entered the palace. She had volunteered to enter the palace; Jiang Juan had confirmed several times that Lan Ting said she had served Jiang Juan for many years and was willing to stay with him in the palace.</p><p>"Master, why are you looking so… so bad?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sat drowsily in front of the mirror, while Lan Ting was busy combing his hair. She glanced at him in the mirror and immediately frowned, finding him abnormally pale.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't seem too concerned about it, "Hasn't it always been like this?"</p><p>Lan Ting shook her head, "It's not quite the same."</p><p>Indeed, Jiang Juan had never looked particularly well lately, especially his lips, which were unusually pale. Even if they were pale, there was usually a hint of rosy color in them, but today, there wasn't even that.</p><p>Lan Ting asked him, "Sir, are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did feel slightly unwell, with a dizzy sensation in his head. However, he always found it painful to wake up early and didn't think much of it, "I'm not feeling unwell."</p><p>Despite her concerns, Lan Ting frowned tightly, "Then... if Sir feels unwell, remember to tell me."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, just as someone walked in and asked him, "Unwell?"</p><p>A dark black robe trailed behind him, layered like clouds, with a clear-boned hand reaching out to touch Jiang Juan's forehead. Jiang Juan gently held it back and shook his head, "No."</p><p>"Lan Ting said my complexion is poor and asked if I was feeling unwell."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his face, sized Jiang Juan up for a moment, then touched his lips, "Here, the color is too light."</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't really tell the difference from usual and muttered, "Maybe I didn't sleep well enough."</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed, unsure if he believed him. He asked Lan Ting for some rouge, dipped his fingers lightly, and applied it to Jiang Juan's soft lips.</p><p>"…I don't want it."</p><p>Jiang Juan pushed his hand away, "I'm not a girl."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him, lowering his gaze instead and smoothing the powder evenly on Jiang Juan's lips. His demeanor was cold, making Jiang Juan feel as if he were being pushed away impatiently, thus seeming even more distant and unapproachable. However, his actions were gentle, and his focus unwavering.</p><p>Lan Ting couldn't help but laugh. After a while, she sighed and said, "Your complexion looks much better now."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at herself in the mirror and found something strange about her appearance no matter how she looked. He glanced at Xue Fangli and felt quite unbalanced.</p><p>He thought that applying some rouge would improve his complexion, but Xue Fangli's lip color was naturally bright red.</p><p>As he thought about it, Jiang Juan reached out and touched his lips. Xue Fangli asked him, "What?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes and said, "I'll help you apply some rouge as well."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him lazily without responding. Jiang Juan took this as a sign of permission and grabbed Xue Fangli's neck, tilting his head to get closer.</p><p>—It wasn't that he used his fingers dipped in rouge like Xue Fangli; rather, he pressed his lips to Xue Fangli's, rubbing them together mischievously.</p><p>When Jiang Juan felt it was enough, he pulled back, but a second later, he frowned, "Why is this so?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's lip color was so bright red that even with rouge on, the color was concealed, and there was no way to see it.</p><p>"You can't see the rouge."</p><p>Xue Fangli grinned and said carelessly, "You didn't kiss long enough. Kiss me again for a longer time, and you'll probably see it."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't stupid, "I'm not kissing anymore, go away."</p><p>Lan Ting found this amusing but finished her task of tying Jiang Juan's hair. Once everything was almost ready, Supervisor Wang smiled and ran in, "Your Majesty, Empress, it's time. Please hurry."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded slightly and extended a hand to Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan grabbed it and tried to stand up, but he suddenly felt dizzy and fell into Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Xue Fangli held him and asked again, "Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Actually, Jiang Juan has been feeling dizzy lately, but the duration was never long. Whenever he felt better, he would forget about it and not take it to heart. Moreover, today was the coronation ceremony, and Jiang Juan did not want to delay official matters.</p><p>He endured his discomfort and forced himself to say, “I’m fine. I just... stumbled.”</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time before saying, “Call the imperial physician.”</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "I'm okay. Let's go, it’s almost time; don't delay."</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan tried to stand up but was so dizzy that his body could not support him. He had no choice but to grab onto Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli hugged him around the waist, shivering all over. Guo Zongguan, seeing this, feared that something might be wrong with Jiang Juan and dared not delay. He hurriedly ran out, shouting, "Imperial physician! Call the imperial physician quickly—!"</p><p>Jiang Juan's forehead rested in Xue Fangli’s embrace, his heart beating fast and his chest feeling stifled.</p><p>Perhaps it really wasn't a big problem. After resting for a while, Jiang Juan's condition improved. Before the imperial physician arrived, he had already recovered.</p><p>“I’m fine now.”</p><p>With his lips still painted with rouge, Jiang Juan remained as radiant as peach blossoms throughout. He pushed Xue Fangli’s hand away and slowly stood up, explaining, "I probably got up too quickly just now, so my head felt dizzy."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Jiang Juan urged, “We should go.”</p><p>Xue Fangli, however, said, “Wait until the imperial physician examines you.”</p><p>“But it will take a long time for the imperial physician to arrive. What if we delay?”</p><p>“We’ll just have to delay then.”</p><p>Although Xue Fangli's tone was gentle, his words were firm and left no room for negotiation, "Don’t move around; rest properly."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought he was making a mountain out of a molehill. He frowned slightly and negotiated with Xue Fangli, “Then… should I wait for the imperial physician while you go first?”</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond, his attitude leaving no room for ambiguity. Jiang Juan sighed and muttered, "What is this? Ah."</p><p>"He was merely not attending court, but you didn't even go to the coronation ceremony."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him, letting him complain freely. Seeing that Jiang Juan would not sit still, he pressed the man back into his embrace.</p><p>Poor Doctor Sun Taimi had practically run all the way over, arriving breathless and struggling to catch his breath as he took out his medicine box. He said panting, "Empress, Your Excellency—Your Excellency—"</p><p>Jiang Juan rolled up his sleeve and extended a hand familiarly toward him. Doctor Sun Taimi smiled gratefully and placed his fingers on it.</p><p>After a moment, Doctor Sun Taimi asked in confusion, "Empress, what happened just now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "I just got a bit dizzy."</p><p>Doctor Sun Taimi hesitated, saying, "But Your Highness's pulse shows no abnormality."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli and said, "As I said, it was because I got up too quickly."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not speak but merely gazed at Doctor Sun Taimi. The doctor understood his meaning and examined the pulse again before stating once more, "The Empress's pulse shows no abnormality."</p><p>With no abnormalities, there was nothing to worry about. Jiang Juan let out a breath of relief, grabbed Xue Fangli's hand, and pulled him forward. "Your Majesty, we really need to leave now."</p><p>Jiang Juan himself did not seem overly concerned. Xue Fangli glanced at him for a few moments before turning to Doctor Sun Taimi and saying, "Follow us."</p><p>Doctor Sun Taimi acknowledged the order, replying, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Outside Hua Gai Hall, all the officials were gathered.</p><p>"What time is it?"</p><p>"Where is His Majesty? Why hasn't He arrived yet?"</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>The hour was approaching, but the new emperor had yet to make an appearance. The court officials were all bewildered and asked each other questions, but since they were all there, none of them knew what was happening. They could only continue asking.</p><p>For a moment, the entire hall was filled with whispered conversations.</p><p>Of course, not everyone was completely unaware of what was going on.</p><p>"It must be Jiang Juan."</p><p>Xue Congyun, Jiang Qingliang, and Gu Puwang were scattered in different parts of the hall but still exchanged a knowing glance.</p><p>His fifth brother had been detained; there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>What happened to his Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Congyun was quite worried about it.</p><p>Fortunately, not long after, a sedan chair was brought in. Wang Zongguan shouted loudly, "His Majesty has arrived——!"</p><p>"Greetings to His Majesty!"</p><p>The whispered conversations ceased immediately, and the officials prostrated themselves on the ground, looking towards the voice.</p><p>A black robe swept past, golden embroidery shimmering brightly. Xue Fangli stepped out of the sedan chair slowly but did not take an immediate step forward; instead, he reached into the sedan chair again.</p><p>Under everyone's watchful eyes, he brought someone out.</p><p>Jiang Juan buried his head in Xue Fangli's arms, feeling only despair.</p><p>He had said that he no longer felt dizzy and was truly fine. However, Xue Fangli still refused to let him walk on his own and insisted on carrying Jiang Juan.</p><p>He originally did not want to lose face, but in the end, he still made a fool of himself at the coronation ceremony.</p><p>Jiang Juan lost his dream and could only pretend that nothing had happened by not looking around.</p><p>In this way, Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan as he walked past the kneeling officials, climbed up the steps, and finally stood on the highest point before putting Jiang Juan down.</p><p>Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Arise."</p><p>"Long live His Majesty—!"</p><p>"Long live Her Majesty—!"</p><p>The officials bowed with reverence.</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded slightly, glancing at Jiang Juan who did not seem happy. He knew that Jiang Juan was embarrassed and chuckled softly to himself. This was the first time he had spoken to his officials, but what he said was—</p><p>"Her Majesty's health was unwell, which is why there was a delay just now, and I carried him up here."</p><p>The new emperor arrived late, and the officials were originally unaware of what had happened. Now that he explained it, they all understood.</p><p>—Her Majesty's health was unwell.</p><p>Such an important matter as his coronation could be delayed, which clearly demonstrated the status of this new empress in his heart and once again confirmed the extent of his affection for Jiang Juan.</p><p>The officials were quite surprised, and their gaze toward Jiang Juan became even more intense.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>It seemed that not explaining it at all would have been better.</p><p>The coronation ceremony needed to announce to heaven and earth and also to the ancestors. Incense burning was an indispensable part of this ritual.</p><p>Manager Wang handed over a few incense sticks, and Xue Fangli took them lazily, then slowly inserted them into the censer.</p><p>Seeing this, Manager Wang smiled and said, "The ceremony is complete——!"</p><p>The officials bowed again: "We pay homage to His Majesty——!"</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan should have bowed along with them too, but he didn't like kneeling. Since Xue Fangli hadn't asked him to, Jiang Juan boldly slacked off, hiding on the side to watch the show.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over and said to Jiang Juan, "Come here."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh," though reluctantly, still obediently moving towards him. However, before he reached his side, a familiar dizziness hit him again.</p><p>This time, the dizziness was far more intense than any previous experience.</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed to have said something else, but his voice sounded as if it came from afar, making Jiang Juan hard to hear clearly. Moreover, Jiang Juan's vision began to blur, everything turning grayish, and he could see nothing at all.</p><p>In the midst of the spinning world, Jiang Juan was bewildered and helpless. He wanted to grab onto something, but the entire world was shaking, and he couldn't hold on to anything.</p><p>"Jiang, juan."</p><p>"Brother Jue! Brother Jue——!"</p><p>The last thing he remembered was his hand being forcefully grasped, along with many urgent cries.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into a silent darkness.</p>
