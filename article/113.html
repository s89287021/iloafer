						<p>Jiang Juan really was voluntarily working.</p><p>When they arrived at the place, Jiang Juan was embraced by someone, while Xue Fangli started reading the imperial edict. Jiang Juan found it quite boring and thus began to kill time by taking papers from the desk and folding them.</p><p>It didn't take long before Jiang Juan had folded a full chest of paper cranes and boats, but Xue Fangli still hadn't finished.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help asking him, "Are you done yet?"</p><p>Xue Fangli mumbled an "en" without lifting his head and said, "Wait a bit longer."</p><p>Jiang Juan waited for a few seconds before slowly saying, "A while longer will do."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "……"</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan with a smirk that was somewhere between amusement and not. Jiang Juan directly flopped onto the desk, pressing down on the imperial edict so he couldn't read it anymore.</p><p>"You said it wouldn't take long, but you've taken such a long time."</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned slightly, muttering his complaints. He behaved like a mischievous little animal, causing trouble by lying flat on the desk, making others put aside their work to pacify him.</p><p>Xue Fangli wrapped his arms around Jiang Juan's waist, gently pulling him back with slight force, but Jiang Juan grabbed onto the desk and refused to get up. He muttered, "You didn't say it would take this long when you said I could come with you."</p><p>"The longer you lie here, the longer you have to stay."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Didn't you want to come yourself in the end?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "……"</p><p>Wasn't he worried?</p><p>Could he not regret it now?</p><p>Jiang Juan Sheng got up with no enthusiasm, leaning his head on Xue Fangli's shoulder. "Don't talk to me. Just get your work done quickly. I want to go back to bed and sleep."</p><p>It was he who disturbed people and urged them to hurry. Jiang Juan had said everything there was to say, but Xue Fangli remained silent, only glancing at his memorial and casually uttering a "mhm."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only muster a bit more patience.</p><p>This was so boring, really so boring.</p><p>He couldn't stand it anymore.</p><p>Counting the tea leaves in the cups, the number of glass beads on the drooping curtains, then the patterns on Wang Zongguan's robe and finally the maid standing respectfully at his side, Jiang Juan could not bear it any longer.</p><p>He glanced at Xue Fangli. Feeling that he was still in a tolerable condition, he decided to make his escape.</p><p>But escaping required strategy. Having come this far, Jiang Juan knew Xue Fangli would definitely not let him go easily.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Jiang Juan gasped, covering his heart with his hand and slowly lowering his head, his forehead almost touching the desk.</p><p>"Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>A clearly defined hand came to support him at the bottom to prevent him from hurting himself. Xue Fangli held him close and ordered, "Bring in the imperial physician—"</p><p>"No need," Jiang Juan weakly shook his head. "No need for the physician. It was just a sudden jolt earlier that made me feel a bit painful. Now I'm fine, just feeling a little stuffed."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned. "Are you really sure?"</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke in a thread-like voice. "I am sure."</p><p>He glanced at Xue Fangli and said in an exaggerated manner, "I'll just go out for some fresh air. Then I'll rest for a while before coming back."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze and stared at Jiang Juan for a few seconds.</p><p>Youth frowned slightly, looking rather uncomfortable, though not quite in pain. He likely had nothing serious, considering he always had this issue; staying indoors for too long would make him short of breath.</p><p>However, when sleeping indoors, no matter how long he slept, he never felt discomfort.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't speak, but Jiang Juan asked him. Xue Fangli simply replied, "Join me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. "Just finish up quickly and come back to accompany me, okay? So that you won't have to... "</p><p>He hadn't been lying down for long when he was pulled away again.</p><p>Knowing what Jiang Juan was thinking, Xue Fangli smiled slightly and nodded. "Take your time. If you still feel uncomfortable, tell someone to call the imperial physician."</p><p>Jiang Juan agreed. "Alright."</p><p>Though running, Xue Fangli had yet to take his medication that day, which Jiang Juan remembered well. Before leaving, he specifically told Wang Zongguan, "Can you start boiling the medicine for His Majesty now?"</p><p>Wang Zongguan hurriedly replied, "Of course, I'll go right away."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded in satisfaction and reminded Xue Fangli, "Make sure to drink it hot when it's ready."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, and Jiang Juan added, "I have a keen sense of smell. If you try to fool me without drinking it, be careful tonight."</p><p>Xue Fangli made a light sound of acknowledgment.</p><p>Only then did Jiang Juan leave, but he didn't pay attention to his footing and suddenly stumbled, nearly falling over. Fortunately, Xue Fangli reached out and steadied him.</p><p>Almost falling was quite embarrassing. Jiang Juan was desperately trying to think of an excuse when Xue Fangli suddenly picked him up, saying in a calm tone, "How have you become so weak?"</p><p>It was clearly a misunderstanding; Jiang Juan's weakness was due to his mental condition.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He originally wanted to explain, but after thinking for a moment, he decided not to.</p><p>His heart disease made him weak and powerless, even unable to walk. It was better than slipping on his own and making himself look foolish.</p><p>"I don't want it either."</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled, and Xue Fangli lifted her foot to go out. After personally carrying Jiang Juan into the sedan chair, Xue Fangli said, "Go back and rest well. If you feel unwell, don't endure it."</p><p>As long as he could lie down at home, anything would be fine. Jiang Juan agreed readily, "Alright, okay."</p><p>The sedan jolted along, nearing Lingguang Palace when Jiang Juan suddenly heard someone calling him.</p><p>"Sir!"</p><p>It was Lan Ting. She was standing outside the palace waiting eagerly.</p><p>A few days ago, when Jiang Juan left the Wangfu, Lan Ting said she couldn't leave Bai Xuechao alone, so he didn't bring her back with him. Seeing her suddenly, Jiang Juan felt a bit surprised. He lifted the curtain to ask, but Lan Ting smiled and said, "Sir, Doctor Hua has arrived!"</p><p>Doctor Hua?</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned for a moment. Lan Ting reminded him, "He's your friend, right? Didn't you want him to see the Emperor?"</p><p>He came so quickly! Jiang Juan reacted and hurriedly asked her, "Where is he?"</p><p>"He's at the Wangfu."</p><p>"Yes, Empress."</p><p>The carriage turned, and Jiang Juan was quite happy about it.</p><p>This friend of my grandfather's, since he is called a divine doctor, must be very skilled. Schue Fangli is so severely ill, often coughing up blood; perhaps this divine doctor can truly cure him. Otherwise, if he keeps coughing like that, Jiang Juan felt she would end up a widow sooner or later.</p><p>She did not want to become a widow at all!</p><p>At the same time, Manager Wang had people start boiling the medicine and was about to step into the palace when the guards approached him, whispering something. Upon hearing it, Manager Wang's eyes lit up.</p><p>"Your Majesty," Manager Wang entered the palace, "the divine doctor has arrived—it is that one—famous in Jiangnan as a divine doctor, Hua Ling—and he has come to the capital."</p><p>Schue Fangli paused his reading of the memorial and looked up, "Where?"</p><p>Schue Fangli nodded, "Prepare a carriage."</p><p>"Yes, old servant will go prepare immediately."</p><p>Manager Wang responded and hurried out. Schue Fangli's fingers tapped lightly on the desk as he thought deeply, lowering his eyes.</p><p>A divine doctor from Jiangnan.</p><p>He hoped this divine doctor could truly live up to his reputation and cure the young man's heart disease.</p><p>Otherwise...</p><p>The young man's heart disease flared up so frequently, and he was already so frail; it was not a good sign at all.</p><p>Thinking of this, Schue Fangli's face turned cold.</p><p>Jiang Juan stepped down from the sedan chair and instructed Lan Ting to lead the way.</p><p>Lan Ting could not help but laugh bitterly. "Young Master, there's no one competing with you, why are you so anxious?"</p><p>Lan Ting had no choice but to quicken her pace.</p><p>"It's right here."</p><p>Entering a courtyard, Lan Ting pointed with her finger, and Jiang Juan dashed over.</p><p>Lan Ting: "..."</p><p>To be honest, their young master had been unusually lazy lately. Lan Ting was accustomed to him sitting when he could stand and lying down when he could sit. This was the first time she saw him run so fast.</p><p>In the next moment, Lan Ting was astonished to discover that her young master was not just running quickly!</p><p>Driven by his eagerness, Jiang Juan completely forgot about social etiquette; forget knocking on the door— with a "bang," he directly kicked open the door.</p><p>"Doctor, my husband frequently coughs up blood, is frail and weak. I don't want to be a widow for now, can you...?"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, their eyes met.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>They remained silent for a few seconds before they both spoke simultaneously.</p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Why are you here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Shouldn't you be reading memorials and taking medicine at the same time?"</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, "Shouldn't you be resting in Lingguang Pavilion?"</p><p>Not mentioning taking medicine was fine, but once he brought it up, Jiang Juan asked him in shock, "Didn't you say you were too weak to move? How could you carry him with one hand?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said slowly, "Didn't you have a heart attack and couldn't even walk steadily? You kicked the door open?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>Their eyes met, but no one answered. At this moment, the air was filled with awkwardness.</p><p>Xue Fangli let go of Hua Shenyi and said to Jiang Juan, "Although I cough up blood, I never said that I was too weak."</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "While my heart attack does keep flaring up, I never said that I couldn't walk steadily because of it. Maybe I just stumbled."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Silence, a deathly silence.</p><p>Hua Shenyi was confused and said, "The two of you..."</p><p>Xue Fangli swept his eyes around, "Get out."</p><p>Jiang Juan also frowned and said, "Shut up for now."</p><p>Dr. Hua Shenyi: "???"</p><p>Alright, let them go.</p><p>The atmosphere between these two was clearly off. Dr. Hua Shenyi touched his nose and turned to leave, but before he could take a few steps, Xue Fangli called out, "Hold on."</p><p>"Please diagnose my queen's pulse for me," Xue Fangli smiled, though his tone was dangerously ominous. "His heart condition frequently flares up, causing me great worry every day."</p><p>At this point, Xue Fangli had a hunch, perhaps even more than just a guess.</p><p>"Are your heart attacks feigned?"</p><p>He realized it, and Jiang Juan also figured it out roughly at the same time. "You keep coughing blood and say you won't live long. Are you just scaring me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond but only smiled slightly. "Given the severity of your heart condition, let's start with a pulse diagnosis to see what Dr. Shenyi thinks."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't going down without a fight either: "Your condition is worse. After coughing like that just now, you should be the one seeing Dr. Shenyi."</p><p>"You're either panicking or experiencing chest tightness all the time, and heart pain is frequent for you. Naturally, you should be the one to see him."</p><p>"I'm fine; I just get a bit tight in my chest and some pain from time to time. Unlike you, who keeps coughing blood. Look, coughing blood isn't something trivial."</p><p>"Neither is your heart condition."</p><p>The two of them argued back and forth for a long while without giving up. Dr. Shenyi looked at Xue Fangli and then Jiang Juan, suggesting, "Why don't both of you see him together?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>"Not necessary," Xue Fangli maintained an expressionless face and spoke calmly. "I came here for my queen. Since he is also here, you can have him check on both of you."</p><p>This was quite a coincidence, Jiang Juan glanced at him and said, "I came here to ask if Master Hua can treat your hemoptysis. Don't bother, you must show me."</p><p>Actually, Jiang Juan wasn't the least bit nervous about having Master Hua examine her pulse. He had already been examined before, so as long as he detected any congenital ailments, Jiang Juan could easily bluff her way through.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan said, "Examining the pulse is just that; I can show it to him, but you must also look."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Why aren't you speaking? Are you feeling guilty??"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and replied, "So you're not feeling guilty?"</p><p>"I certainly don't feel guilty!"</p><p>To prove this point, Jiang Juan immediately extended her hand to Master Hua, saying, "Can you take a look at me?"</p><p>Seeing this, Master Hua approached Jiang Juan, felt her pulse, and concentrated for a moment.</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan stretched out her hand rather decisively, but for some reason, she felt inexplicably uneasy. Seeing that Master Hua didn't speak up, she couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Your Majesty, you... are fine."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>She said in disbelief, "How can you be fine? Feel it again! Don't I have a congenital ailment?"</p><p>Master Hua smiled and said, "Your Majesty does indeed have a congenital ailment. However, after years of nourishment, your qi and blood, although slightly deficient compared to ordinary people, are already balanced for you and will not recur frequently."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>This was quite a coincidence. Jiang Juan glanced at him and said, "I came here specifically to ask if Master Hua can treat your hemoptysis. Don't bother with anything else; you must show me your pulse."</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan wasn't the least bit nervous about having Master Hua examine her pulse. She had been examined before, so as long as he detected any congenital ailments, she could easily bluff her way through.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan said, "Examining the pulse is just that; I can show it to him, but you must also look at mine."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Why aren't you speaking? Are you feeling guilty?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at her and replied, "So you're not feeling guilty?"</p><p>"I certainly don't feel guilty!"</p><p>To prove this point, Jiang Juan immediately extended her hand to Master Hua, saying, "Can you take a look at me?"</p><p>Seeing this, Master Hua approached Jiang Juan, felt her pulse, and concentrated for a moment.</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had stretched out her hand rather decisively, but for some reason, she felt inexplicably uneasy. Seeing that Master Hua didn't speak up, she couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Your Majesty, you... are fine."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>She said in disbelief, "How can you be fine? Feel it again! Don't I have a congenital ailment?"</p><p>Master Hua smiled and said, "Your Majesty does indeed have a congenital ailment. However, after years of nourishment, your qi and blood, although slightly deficient compared to ordinary people, are already balanced for you and will not recur frequently."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>This was quite a coincidence. Jiang Juan glanced at him and said, "I came here specifically to ask if Master Hua can treat your hemoptysis.

She had been examined before, so as long as he detected any congenital ailments, she could easily bluff her way through.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan said, "Examining the pulse is just that; I can show it to him, but you must also look at mine."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent, his expression unreadable.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him, "Why aren't you speaking? Are you feeling guilty?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at her and replied, "So you're not feeling guilty?"</p><p>"I certainly don't feel guilty!"</p><p>To prove this point, Jiang Juan immediately extended her hand to Master Hua, saying, "Can you take a look at me?"</p><p>Seeing this, Master Hua approached Jiang Juan, felt her pulse, and concentrated for a moment.</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had stretched out her hand rather decisively, but for some reason, she felt inexplicably uneasy.

However, after years of nourishment, your qi and blood, although slightly deficient compared to ordinary people, are already balanced for you and will not recur frequently."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>"How could you say it so definitively? Jiang Juan refused to admit defeat and struggled, 'How do you know it's impossible? What if there is a way?' </p><p>Hua Shen Yi smiled calmly after listening, 'There’s no "what if." Because over the past many years, all the medicine you drank, the herbal baths you soaked in, even the medicinal food you ate, were all personally prepared by your humble servant. Your humble servant naturally dares to make such a guarantee.' </p><p>Jiang Juan: ‘…’ </p><p>Jiang Juan: ‘???’ </p><p>He stared at Hua Shen Yi in disbelief, feeling that he had misjudged the situation.</p><p>"But, I, you..." </p><p>Jiang Juan could no longer form coherent words. Even without looking up, he could sense a gaze falling on him.</p><p>It was a smile that wasn’t quite a smile, sinister and fierce as if it wanted to devour him.</p><p>No.</p><p>He couldn’t afford for this to be his failure alone.</p><p>Jiang Juan pointed at Xue Fangli, 'There’s also him. Show him quickly, he keeps coughing up blood and says he doesn't have much time left.'</p><p>Hua Shen Yi walked over to Xue Fangli and said respectfully, 'Your Majesty, please extend your hand.' </p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Hua Shen Yi without expression but didn’t make any move to extend his hand.</p><p>Jiang Juan said softly, 'Are you too afraid?'</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, 'You dare to diagnose my pulse even though I have no illness. Naturally, I’m not afraid of anything.'</p><p>As he spoke, Xue Fangli finally extended his hand, and Hua Shen Yi touched his pulse.</p><p>Jiang Juanwen asked, "How is it?"</p><p>Hua Shenyi replied, "This..."</p><p>After carefully choosing his words, he said with difficulty, "Your Majesty does have some minor ailments, but the issue is not severe and not to the point of coughing up blood. As for having little time left... this..."</p><p>Hua Shenyi hinted at Xue Fangli in a subtle way, "Your Majesty, after you return to the palace, you can easily dismiss those physicians who tell you that you have little time left from the Imperial Medical Academy; their medical skills are not proficient and they should not remain there."</p><p>Jiang Juanwen: "..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>At this point, everything was very clear.</p><p>Jiang Juanwen's heart disease was fake.</p><p>Xue Fangli's coughing up blood was also fake.</p><p>Recalling the events, Jiang Juanwen suddenly understood, "No wonder."</p><p>"Today, you asked me to accompany you to read the memorials, and when I refused, you started coughing, making me worry so much that I had to go with you. Last time, I suggested selling your jade pendant, but you said to store it in the vault. Instead of following my advice, you even gave it away to someone else. I got angry at you, but then you coughed up blood again, and I was too worried to stay mad."</p><p>"And there's more..."</p><p>During their stay at the villa, Xue Fangli had ordered High Official Shi to ask him for a sachet, which made Jiang Juanwen suspicious. He went over to investigate and saw Xue Fangli coughing up blood again. Concerned, he stayed overnight.</p><p>Back then, Jiang Juanwen hadn't noticed anything unusual about these events. But now that he realized that Xue Fangli's coughing was fake, when he looked back on the sequence of events, everything seemed problematic.</p><p>Jiang Juanwen asked Xue Fangli in disbelief, "Are you human? You were using coughing up blood to trick me into sleeping with you even during our stay at the villa?"</p><p>"You—you—"</p><p>Jiang Juan became more and more shocked the more he thought about it, not knowing what to say. Xue Fangli's expression was also far from pleasant. "Your heart condition, doesn't it keep flaring up?"</p><p>In the past, he had thought that Jiang Juan's heart condition always seemed to occur at the most inconvenient times. Whenever Jiang Juan did not want to do something—let him touch her, let him hug her, or go out with him—it would flare up right then.</p><p>Jiang Juan shouted loudly, "So what! I only deceived you about your heart condition; you deceived me about two things. You put on a good act in front of me and also deceived me into coughing blood, causing me to worry about you all the time."</p><p>"You—"</p><p>Frustrated, Jiang Juan said, "You liar, I don't want anything more to do with you!"</p><p>After letting loose his words, Jiang Juan turned and walked away. He seemed genuinely angry, confused by being deceived, tightly pursing his lips, and his eyes brimming with tears, feeling extremely wronged.</p><p>In reality, as soon as he stepped out of the room, Jiang Juan secretly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>——Fortunately, he reacted quickly enough, venting at Xue Fangli first and making quite a scene. Otherwise, he would have definitely been taken advantage of and harshly punished.</p><p>Jiang Juan knew all too well how evil that thing, Xue Fangli, was!</p>
