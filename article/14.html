						<p>A tempest arose in Jiang Nian's heart.</p><p>In just a few days, how could he have changed so much?</p><p>Whether from his previous life or the last time Jiang Nian saw him, Jiang Juan had always been timid and gloomy.</p><p>He dared not meet anyone's gaze or socialize. He was ridiculed in the capital, but only Jiang Nian knew that this detestable Third Young Master actually possessed an extremely beautiful face.</p><p>— He often secretly watched Jiang Nian with an admiring and yearning look.</p><p>This face should have been beautiful, but his self-doubt and gloom had sapped much of its radiance. Now, all that was gone, as if he had undergone a complete transformation.</p><p>His eyes were pure and breathtakingly beautiful, yet they remained untainted by any worldly coarseness, as if he came from the Jade Pool.</p><p>One's appearance might change temporarily with external means, but could a person's temperament and personality change so quickly?</p><p>It was impossible, utterly impossible.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Jiang Nian suddenly remembered something and widened his eyes.</p><p>Could it be that Jiang Juan had also reincarnated?</p><p>No, that was impossible.</p><p>Jiang Nian quickly dismissed this terrifying thought.</p><p>But how could Jiang Juan have changed so much?</p><p>How could he sit so boldly in the Prince’s arms without a hint of fear or unease, as if he had no idea how ruthless this man was?</p><p>Jiang Nian found it incomprehensible.</p><p>Of course, there was another thing that troubled him even more.</p><p>—Why would the Prince agree to carry him in his arms?</p><p>Wasn’t he disgusted by touching someone else’s body now?</p><p>Jiang Nian stared at Jiang Juan in a daze for a long time before smiling and saying, "Princess Consort."</p><p>After all, it was the main character who received attention. Jiang Juan politely responded, "Mm, brothers, you’re here."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and then explained to him, "I made you wait so long, it’s my fault, it’s my—"</p><p>Unable to find the right words that wouldn’t make him seem like an antagonist provoking someone, Jiang Juan stumbled. Xue Fangli saw this and casually said, "He was sleeping, Your Highness didn’t have anyone report it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>It seemed a bit presumptuous.</p><p>He gently pulled on Xue Fangli’s sleeve, shook his head, indicating that he should not intervene. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan but showed no reaction.</p><p>What was there to be nervous about?</p><p>Even he wasn’t afraid; why would he be so nervous facing this Second Prince?</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, his expression one of deep thought.</p><p>This appearance, however, had a different meaning in Jiang Nian’s eyes.</p><p>He was clearly displeased.</p><p>At this moment, the Li Wang showed no expression on his face and said nothing, finally allowing Jiang Nian some solace.</p><p>No matter how favored she was, she was only favored.</p><p>See, even a small gesture would still upset the Li Wang?</p><p>Jiang Nian felt a vindictive pleasure and lost his usual sense of propriety. "Brother, with His Excellency the Prince so protective of you, why are you complaining about him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "I'm not."</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled slightly. "Then—"</p><p>His words were cut off.</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted her eyelids and stared at Jiang Nian with a smile that seemed to be devoid of genuine emotion.</p><p>The same cold gaze as in his previous life.</p><p>Arrogant and aloof. The man was smiling, but there was no warmth in his eyes. He looked lazily at Jiang Nian as if he had seen through all the ugliness in Jiang Nian's heart, mocking him endlessly.</p><p>Jiang Nian hated him, and he was truly afraid of him too.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat, and Jiang Nian turned pale. He lowered his head and forced a smile, "…It was a slip of tongue."</p><p>Secretary Jiang frowned. Jiang Nian was usually gentle and polite, and those words that had incited discord did not seem to be something he would normally say. However, Secretary Jiang did not think much of it, assuming that after waiting for so long, Jiang Nian was simply feeling discontent.</p><p>Secretary Jiang also felt quite frustrated.</p><p>I had originally planned to scold Jiang Juan thoroughly upon seeing him, but unexpectedly, Xue Fangli was also there. I could only temporarily suppress my anger.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Secretary Jiang said respectfully, "Your Highness, we are here to visit Lady Wang and will just be having some casual conversations. You may continue with your own affairs without needing to accompany us."</p><p>"I have nothing to do, merely came over to accompany Lady Wang. I did not specially come for the sake of Secretary Jiang," Xue Fangli glanced at him and said with a smile, "Secretary Jiang need not worry unnecessarily."</p><p>Secretary Jiang choked on his words.</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli continued, "Since it is just casual conversation, Secretary Jiang may be more relaxed when I am not here."</p><p>Secretary Jiang: "……"</p><p>With Your Highness present, how could he possibly relax? How dare he act so casually?</p><p>He shouldn't have come on this visit.</p><p>Secretary Jiang regretted it bitterly.</p><p>But since he was already here and had already spoken, Secretary Jiang forced himself to smile and ask Jiang Juan gently, "Where are you hurt?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him strangely due to the drastic change in his attitude. After a while, he replied, "…My foot."</p><p>Secretary Jiang's smile froze. Suppressing his anger, he asked politely, "How did you get hurt?"</p><p>Jiang Juan evaded the question by saying, "I stumbled accidentally."</p><p>Secretary Jiang and Jiang Juan were not close; they usually had nothing to say to each other either. After inquiring about his injury, Secretary Jiang didn't know what else to say and fell into an awkward silence.</p><p>"Why have you stopped talking?" Xue Fangli asked leisurely, "Is that it?"</p><p>"Of course," Jiang Shushu forced a smile, "Xiao Nian, you two have always had a good relationship. Do you have anything to say?"</p><p>Jiang Nian looked like he was in a trance and did not hear Jiang Shushu calling him. Seeing this, Jiang Shushu could only pretend again and said to Jiang Juan, "You cannot return home tomorrow. When your foot injury is healed, make sure to come back to visit; everyone misses you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was not stupid; she responded vaguely, "Okay, okay."</p><p>Jiang Shushu pretended to be worried, "By the way, it takes a hundred days to heal a broken bone and torn muscle. You must take good care of your foot injury so as not to leave any lingering illness in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "You are right."</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "..."</p><p>He racked his brains here while Jiang Juan was almost deceiving him out of his wits. Jiang Shushu nearly fainted and immediately turned stern, "You——"</p><p>Before he could finish, Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids and said nonchalantly, "Mr. Jiang, I say as I please. When I am not around, it does not mean you can act so casually."</p><p>Jiang Shushu stared at him and felt a chill down his spine. He remained stiff for a while before speaking softly to Jiang Juan, "Are your heart problems relapsing recently? It's hot now; be careful not to catch a cold or..."</p><p>Jiang Shushu went on with more irrelevant talk. Out of social courtesy, Jiang Juan had initially tried hard to respond to him, but as he spoke more and more, she became increasingly drowsy, her eyelids growing heavier until she could barely keep up with his lies.</p><p>——She fell asleep in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "..."</p><p>This was even more infuriating.</p><p>But he dared not show his anger, only managing to suppress the growing rage and lowered his voice to ask Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, since Lady Jiang is tired, I will take my leave so as not to disturb her rest."</p><p>After being ignored for a while longer, Xue Fangli finally spoke slowly, "Mr. Jiang is right."</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "?"</p><p>"Of course," Jiang Shushu forced a smile, "Xiao Nian, you two have always had a good relationship. Do you have anything to say?"</p><p>Jiang Nian appeared dazed and did not hear Jiang Shushu calling him. Seeing this, Jiang Shushu could only feign concern again and addressed Jiang Juan, "You cannot return home tomorrow. Once your foot injury is healed, make sure to come back to visit; everyone misses you."</p><p>Jiang Juan, not being stupid, replied vaguely, "Okay, okay."</p><p>Jiang Shushu pretended worry, "After all, it takes a hundred days to heal a broken bone and torn muscle. You must take good care of your foot injury so as not to leave any lingering illness in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "You are right."</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "..."</p><p>Struggling for words, Jiang Shushu was almost deceived by Jiang Juan's responses. He nearly fainted and then became stern, "You——"</p><p>Before he could finish, Xue Fangli opened his eyes and said nonchalantly, "Mr. Jiang, I say as I please. When I am not around, it does not mean you can act so casually."</p><p>Jiang Shushu stared at him, feeling a chill down his spine. He remained stiff for a while before speaking softly to Jiang Juan, "Are your heart problems relapsing recently?

Do you have anything to say?"</p><p>Jiang Nian appeared dazed and did not hear Jiang Shushu calling him. Seeing this, Jiang Shushu could only feign concern again and turned to Jiang Juan, saying, "You cannot return home tomorrow. Once your foot is fully healed, make sure to come back to visit; everyone misses you."</p><p>Jiang Juan, who was no fool, responded vaguely, "Okay, okay."</p><p>Jiang Shushu pretended to be worried, "After all, it takes a hundred days to heal a broken bone and torn muscle. You must take good care of your foot injury so as not to leave any lingering illness in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "You are right."</p><p>Jiang Shushu: "..."</p><p>Struggling for words, Jiang Shushu was almost deceived by Jiang Juan's responses.

No matter what, they had finally managed to get away.</p><p>The two of them were escorted out of the villa. As soon as they stepped outside, Shangshu Jiang felt that even the air was unusually fresh. He frowned and said, "Prince Wang is protecting him."</p><p>Jiang Nian did not want to admit it and only muttered, "Prince Wang must have been momentarily moved by emotion."</p><p>This man was the most heartless.</p><p>Even though he doted on and protected Jiang Juan at present, how long could such affection last?</p><p>There would be no exception.</p><p>It absolutely would not happen.</p><p>Jiang Nian took a deep breath. He repeatedly warned himself in his heart.</p><p>——Liu Wang is certainly not a good match, but the Marquis of Anping is.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Nian felt like seeing the Marquis of Anping and said to Shangshu Jiang, "Father, I want to visit the marquis's residence."</p><p>Upon hearing him mention the marquis's residence, Shangshu Jiang asked, "The marquis said a few days ago that he would go to the palace to request the emperor's permission for our marriage. Has it been granted?"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook his head, "He hasn't told me yet; I assume he hasn't gone to the palace."</p><p>"If not for his uncle, you two would have become engaged long ago," Shangshu Jiang snorted coldly. "It was acceptable for him to be a bit arrogant before, but what about Mr. Bai's first disciple? You were well-versed in literature since childhood, yet he looked down on you while favoring Jiang Juan."</p><p>Jiang Nian forced a smile, "Mr. Bai is renowned worldwide and revered by all. His son-in-law deeply inherited his teachings; perhaps I am indeed inferior to my younger brother in some aspects."</p><p>"How could that be possible?" Shangshu Jiang did not agree. "Incidentally, the Princess Dowager is returning to the capital soon, and his uncle should return as well. Make sure the marquis goes to the palace early to settle things."</p><p>Jiang Nian nodded, "Alright."</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Jiang Nian couldn't help but ask the question that had been on his mind for a long time, "Father, where did the engagement between my brother and Duke Hou come from?"</p><p>Jiang Shangshu replied, "It was arranged by his grandfather and the prince consort."</p><p>Jiang Nian exclaimed in surprise, "But isn't he an old man living in the countryside? How could he have met the prince consort?"</p><p>Jiang Shangshu didn't remember clearly either, "They say he saved the prince consort's life once, but I didn't inquire further."</p><p>Jiang Nian thought deeply, "So that's how it is..."</p><p>In the pavilion, Jiang Juan's eyelashes fluttered slightly, as if he was just waking up. His eyes were still closed, yet he started his 'business' very professionally, "Mm, you're right."</p><p>Gao Guanshi almost burst into laughter at the side, glancing at Xue Falí holding Jiang Juan. He quickly suppressed his laughter but couldn't stop his shoulders from shaking.</p><p>In his opinion, being deceived was even more frustrating than being directly offended or ignored. Yet their empress didn't seem to realize this.</p><p>What a remarkable woman the empress is.</p><p>Gao Guanshi sighed deeply.</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly opened his eyes and found that both Jiang Shangshu and Jiang Nian were gone. He looked around in confusion, "Where are they?"</p><p>Xue Falí said, "They left after you fell asleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "Oh," and the next second, he froze as a thought occurred to him.</p><p>Did I offend the main character three times in a row?</p><p>And yet, I was still sleeping while talking.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He really is that recurring villain who jumps on the hero's face, Jiang Juan sighed sadly.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said dazedly, "In the future, I have to be more careful."</p><p>At this point, Jiang Juan remembered how Xue Fangli was also quite extravagant in his actions, so he added to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, you should be careful too. Don't offend people recklessly anymore."</p><p>The young man had just woken up from a nap, his eyes bright and moist, and his voice very soft. Xue Fangli looked at him with lowered eyes; he was about to sneer but finally only smiled, "Alright."</p>
