						<p>The sound of his words faded away, leaving a long and profound silence.</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent, feeling hurt by the misunderstanding. Jiang Juan asked in frustration: "Prince Wang, are you so untrustworthy?"</p><p>"…I am sorry."</p><p>After a while, Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan and finally said two words.</p><p>"Why do you believe his lies?"</p><p>"Because…"</p><p>The youth was too kind, yet he himself was far from virtuous.</p><p>He was always suspicious like someone seeing a snake in a wine cup, treading lightly as if on thin ice, constantly feeling uneasy.</p><p>And—</p><p>something within him was breaking free from its constraints. His dissatisfaction and desires were also stirring. However, the fruits of dissatisfaction and desire were the seeds planted at an unknown time, deeply buried in the darkest corner of his heart, unseen for a long time.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xue Fangli recalled what the woman had said.</p><p>"Do you know how to keep someone?"</p><p>"Forever, never let your heart be moved."</p><p>Xue Fangli paused, closing his eyes. After a long while, he slowly opened his mouth and spoke.</p><p>"What they think does not matter to this prince."</p><p>For a long time, Xue Fangli had suffered from madness and pain. By nature, he was ruthless, demanding tenfold repayment for any slight against him.</p><p>He enjoyed their fear, to some extent, he was not entirely innocent—he was vengeful and capable of inflicting sufficient cruelty.</p><p>However, these things did not need to be told truthfully to Jiang Juan. He relished the sympathy and compassion the youth offered him, and more so, the focus and seriousness in the youth's gaze.</p><p>Therefore, when Xue Fangli spoke again, he used a soft and helpless tone.</p><p>"Too many people think like that," Xue Fangli said, "This king does not have the time to explain to them. Even if they hate this king even more, they cannot do anything to this king."</p><p>He was fearless, just a madman, everyone knew that angering him meant seeking death.</p><p>Jiang Juan was accusing him of wrongdoing, but after Xue Fangli's words, Jiang Juan found it hard to stay angry at him anymore.</p><p>"You don't care, but I do."</p><p>Jiang Juan almost blurted out the words, and Xue Fangli's expression changed. His dark gaze fixated on Jiang Juan. The surging cruelty and anger within him strangely turned into appeasement, and he was greatly pleased.</p><p>After a long while, the corner of Xue Fangli's lips curled upward, and he said to Jiang Juan, "This king understands."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him and felt that the prince was just placating him. He muttered, "You better really understand."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "You cannot be angry; this king will pay more attention in the future."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli added, "This time, it was this king's fault, making you angry and causing your illness to flare up again."</p><p>"Still feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to shake his head but thought that pretending to be sick worked well. Since the prince promised not to be misunderstood in the future, he decided to make good use of it.</p><p>Jiang Juan touched his chest, "I'm still a little unwell."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, and Jiang Juan slowly said, "Prince, besides being angry, is there any other reason you couldn't sleep well?"</p><p>He enjoyed their fear; in a way, he was not entirely innocent—he was vengeful and capable of inflicting terrible cruelty.</p><p>However, he had no need to tell Jiang Juan the truth. He relished the sympathy and compassion the youth offered him, and even more so, the focused and serious look in the youth's eyes.</p><p>Therefore, when Xue Fangli spoke again, his tone was soft and helpless.</p><p>"Too many people think like that," Xue Fangli said, "This king does not have time to explain to them. Even if they hate this king more, it will not matter."</p><p>He was fearless, just a madman; everyone knew that angering him meant seeking death.</p><p>Jiang Juan was accusing him of wrongdoing, but after Xue Fangli's words, Jiang Juan found it hard to stay angry at him anymore.</p><p>"You don't care, but I do."</p><p>Jiang Juan almost blurted out the words, and Xue Fangli's expression changed.

He savored the sympathy and compassion the youth offered him, and more so, the focused and serious expression in the youth's eyes.</p><p>Therefore, when Xue Fangli spoke again, his tone was soft and filled with helplessness.</p><p>"Too many people think like that," Xue Fangli said, "This king does not have time to explain to them. Even if they hate this king more, it will be of no consequence."</p><p>He was fearless, a mere madman; everyone knew that angering him meant inviting death.</p><p>Jiang Juan was accusing him of wrongdoing, but after Xue Fangli's words, Jiang Juan found it hard to remain angry at him anymore.</p><p>"You don't care, but I do."</p><p>Jiang Juan almost blurted out the words, and Xue Fangli's expression changed. His dark gaze fixated on Jiang Juan. The surging cruelty and anger within him strangely transformed into appeasement, bringing him great pleasure.</p><p>After a long while, the corner of Xue Fangli's lips curled upward, and he said to Jiang Juan, "This king understands."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him and felt that the prince was merely placating him. He muttered, "You better really understand."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "You cannot be angry; this king will pay more attention in the future."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli added, "This time, it was this king's fault, making you angry and causing your illness to flare up again."</p><p>"Still feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to shake his head but thought that pretending to be sick worked well.

The imperial physician prescribed several tonic medicines, rose, and took his leave. Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan, "How did you become so weak?"</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Xue Fangli remembered what the young man had said to him on that carriage ride.</p><p>—"I like many things, but no matter how much I like them, I can only look at them because when my illness is severe, I cannot even hold them. In the future, I will not be able to take them with me either. I feel that having and not having are actually quite similar."</p><p>Is the young man's future… his death?</p><p>He cares about nothing but his heart and does not desire anything; does he also think that one day he will die?</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his expression dark.</p><p>He wanted to keep the young man, but he could not completely retain him.</p><p>The imperial physician said it was too serious; even Jiang Juan, who was calm, was startled. He spoke hesitantly, "Your Majesty…"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "Hm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered, "It's not that serious."</p><p>But to Xue Fangli, it was just a few meaningless words of comfort. Xue Fangli did not take them to heart and calmly asked, "Are you returning home now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Alright."</p><p>Wang Zongguan followed along as well. Upon hearing this, he hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, is that proper?"</p><p>He expressed his concern: "The Princess Consort's heart condition just flared up, and she can't bear the fatigue of travel. The Emperor also said that Your Highness can stay in the palace tonight to let the Princess Consort rest well."</p><p>Jiang Juan could be anywhere; he remained silent as he hugged the thin quilt without speaking a word. Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and, seemingly lost in thought, uttered a "mm" sound.</p><p>Wang Zongguan, on hearing this, smiled broadly and said, "Your servant will go to report to the Emperor immediately."</p><p>Although he had said so, Wang Zongguan couldn't help glancing at Jiang Juan several times, feeling utterly astonished.</p><p>The Prince did not like staying outside; after establishing his residence, he did not like entering the palace either. Not to mention staying overnight... after all, in his youth...</p><p>Wang Zongguan shook his head and stopped thinking further. As he was about to leave, something came to mind, and he turned back to ask, "Your Highness, will you and the Princess Consort have dinner?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan, "Are you going to eat anything?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to eat but also felt a bit scared. With lingering fear in his heart, he asked, "Won't it be medicinal food?"</p><p>"We will have dinner with light flavors; no medicinal food."</p><p>"Alright, I'll arrange for it and ensure someone supervises the entire process."</p><p>Wang Zongguan bowed and left. Jiang Juan looked around curiously and asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, is this where you used to live?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied coolly, "No."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed with surprise, "Ah." He had only casually asked, but Xue Fangli countered, "Do you want to go?"</p><p>He wasn't really eager to go; he was just curious. However, Jiang Juan nodded slightly and said, "Mm."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "After dinner, I'll take you around to see it."</p><p>Feeling satisfied with the arrangement, Jiang Juan agreed. However, his happiness didn't last long, as Xue Fangli then said, "Tomorrow, when we return to the residence, this prince will ask the abbot to come and provide further care for you for a few more days."</p><p>Nourishment and acupuncture.</p><p>The more days you nourish, the more days of acupuncture you will have.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He lifted his head and struggled to say, "Just a rest, do we need it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond, only staring at Jiang Juan. At that moment, he was neither in his usual cheerful demeanor nor cold and distant when displeased; he simply lowered his eyelids to stare at Jiang Juan, inexplicably exuding some dominance.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated to speak. After a long time, he decided to bluff and said, "Alright."</p><p>Feigning illness is good everywhere; acupuncture also hurts.</p><p>He thought of a way out, there was no way he would go through with the acupuncture again.</p><p>However, soon enough, Jiang Juan found that besides the pain from the acupuncture, he had another kind of suffering.</p><p>—the herbal medicine prescribed by the imperial physician has been prepared.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Drink it while it's hot."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>The bowl was dark, and Jiang Juan sniffed it low. He couldn't tell which was more deadly between this bowl and a bowl of chicken soup. Jiang Juan resisted strongly, "Your Highness, I want to eat something first."</p><p>"Medicines should be taken on an empty stomach."</p><p>As a piece of dried fish, Jiang Juan feared both bitterness and exhaustion immensely. Of course, the bitterness he feared was of all kinds—bitterness in every sense. Jiang Juan shook his head fiercely, "It doesn't even smell good to drink."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and saw that Jiang Juan was really unwilling. So, he himself took a small sip of the medicine, "It's still tolerable."</p><p>He remained expressionless with a flat tone, "I only heard it tastes bitter; there's no real flavor."</p><p>Jiang Juan was skeptical, "Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him again, "Shall this king taste it for you one more time?"</p><p>As he spoke, he truly took another sip. A medicine has three parts poison, and for Jiang Juan, the tonic could replenish his poorly functioning heart. However, it wasn't suitable for the prince. Jiang Juan believed his words and reluctantly said, "Alright, drink."</p><p>Jiang Juan grabbed his hand, looked at the medicine closely, sighed deeply, and then gathered his courage to swallow the medicine with Xue Fangli's help.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn, it was so bitter.</p><p>Really, it was that bitter.</p><p>He only took a small sip before wanting to push away Xue Fangli's hand. However, not only did he fail, but Xue Fangli's other hand reached out and pinched Jiang Juan's chin, forcing him to finish the entire bowl of medicine.</p><p>After Jiang Juan drank all the medicine, Xue Fangli handed the medicine bowl to the servant girl, who asked, "Your Highness, are you having dinner?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The servant hurriedly started preparing, and after she turned back, Jiang Juan, this salted fish deceived and devoid of dreams, was pretending to be dead out of unhappiness.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"It tastes too bitter."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained endlessly. Of course, he knew the medicine couldn't be without bitterness, but when the prince spoke so seriously and demanded another sip, Jiang Juan believed him, thinking it wasn't that bitter.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan, who seemed genuinely reluctant to take the medicine. Deciding to taste it himself, he took a small sip and said, "It's still tolerable."</p><p>His expression remained unchanged, his tone flat as he added, "I only heard that it tastes bitter; there's no real flavor."</p><p>Jiang Juan was skeptical. "Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him again, "Shall this king taste it for you one more time?"</p><p>Before Jiang Juan could respond, Xue Fangli took another sip. Though medicine often contained some poison, the tonic could benefit Jiang Juan's poorly functioning heart. However, it wasn't suitable for a prince. Believing Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan reluctantly agreed, "Alright, drink."</p><p>Jiang Juan reached for Xue Fangli's hand, examined the medicine carefully, sighed deeply, and then summoned the courage to swallow it with Xue Fangli's assistance.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn, it was extremely bitter.</p><p>It truly was unbearably bitter.</p><p>He barely managed a small sip before trying to push away Xue Fangli's hand. Instead of succeeding, another hand reached out, pinching Jiang Juan's chin and forcing him to drink the entire bowl of medicine.</p><p>Once Jiang Juan had finished the medicine, Xue Fangli handed the bowl to the servant girl, who asked, "Your Highness, are you having dinner?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The servant quickly started preparing the meal. By the time she turned back, Jiang Juan, feeling deceived and devoid of hope, was pretending to be dead from unhappiness.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"It tastes too bitter."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained endlessly. He knew medicine couldn't be without bitterness, but when the prince spoke so seriously about taking another sip, Jiang Juan believed him, assuming it wouldn't be that bad.</p><p>Xue Fangli cast a glance at Jiang Juan, who appeared truly unwilling to take the medicine. Deciding to taste it himself, he took a small sip and commented, "It's still bearable."</p><p>His expression remained unchanged as he spoke in a neutral tone, "I only heard that it tastes bitter; there's no real flavor."</p><p>Jiang Juan expressed his skepticism. "Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli gave him another glance, "Shall this king taste it for you one more time?"</p><p>Before Jiang Juan could reply, Xue Fangli took another sip. Though medicine often contained some poison, the tonic was beneficial to Jiang Juan's poorly functioning heart. However, it wasn't suitable for a prince. Believing Xue Fangli's words, Jiang Juan reluctantly agreed, "Alright, drink."</p><p>Jiang Juan reached for Xue Fangli's hand, examined the medicine carefully, sighed deeply, and then summoned the courage to swallow it with Xue Fangli's assistance.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn, it was extremely bitter.</p><p>It truly was unbearably bitter.</p><p>He barely managed a small sip before trying to push away Xue Fangli's hand. Instead of succeeding, another hand reached out, pinching Jiang Juan's chin and forcing him to drink the entire bowl of medicine.</p><p>Once Jiang Juan had finished the medicine, Xue Fangli handed the bowl to the servant girl, who asked, "Your Highness, are you having dinner?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The servant hurriedly started preparing the meal. By the time she turned back, Jiang Juan, feeling deceived and devoid of hope, was pretending to be dead from unhappiness.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"It tastes too bitter."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained endlessly. He knew medicine couldn't be without bitterness, but when the prince spoke so seriously about taking another sip, Jiang Juan believed him, assuming it wouldn't be that bad.</p><p>The result was so bitter that he did not even want to mention it, and he was forced to drink the entire bowl.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him with a gentle voice: "No matter how bitter the medicine is, you have to drink it."</p><p>He wanted to keep the youth. Even if he could not keep him for long, he would try his best to keep him for one more day.</p><p>After saying that, his fingers touched the corner where the youth's lips met, and Xue Fangli said again: "Open your mouth."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought he was going to check if she had swallowed the medicine, so she did not cooperate. Xue Fangli then used force, probing into her mouth between her teeth.</p><p>Jiang Juan was already nursing a grudge against the prince for tricking her into drinking the medicine and doubting her. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She could not help but bite him once.</p><p>This bite was quite forceful, but Xue Fangli lowered his head. His crimson lips parted, and he smiled lightly.</p><p>"Bitter?" Xue Fangli looked at her, "If you are really unhappy, just bite this prince a few more times."</p><p>"Take back the bitterness you've endured by biting me; I'll sulk in silence."</p><p>Of course it was bitter. She could bite as much as she wanted. Jiang Juan, who was about to unleash her salty temper, suddenly tasted a hint of sweetness in her mouth.</p><p>Xue Fangli had just pried open her lips and tongue to feed her candied fruits.</p>
