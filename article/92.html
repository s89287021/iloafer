						<p>Jiang Juan, that little bitch, was getting ready to dress up. With his powerful purchasing power, he could have bought her out, but after taking a few steps, he didn't feel like moving anymore. He didn't want to experience the imperial garden or the mountain and rockery; just a glance from afar was enough for him.</p><p>Wang Zongguan noticed his despondent expression and quickly approached to inquire, "Princess Consort, are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't say the truth—he was tired and bored—so he nodded slightly, "I feel a bit uncomfortable."</p><p>Wang Zongguan immediately invited him to rest in the pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion was surrounded by a lake on three sides, with green lotus leaves floating on the surface. Jiang Juan leaned on the railing to enjoy the breeze; it was still not hot, and the natural wind felt very comfortable.</p><p>He just didn't know what to do when summer came. There would be no cola, and definitely no air conditioning.</p><p>Thinking of this made Jiang Juan a bit dejected again.</p><p>He lowered his hands, resting his head on his arm. The wide sleeves were blown up by the wind, revealing a small portion of his wrist, which should have been snow white but was marred by several red finger marks.</p><p>"Hey, you—"</p><p>Xue Congjun had spent the whole morning hiding and finally caught Jiang Juan alone. He strutted into the pavilion, intending to make a grand entrance, but he jumped back in surprise when he lowered his head.</p><p>Jiang Juan's skin was fair, and those red marks were shocking, as if he had been abused. Xue Congjun's tone changed, "What happened to your hand?"</p><p>Then, remembering something, he said cautiously, "I'm just asking; it wasn't me who did it, so you better not tell my brother—Wang Zongguan, you have to testify for me too."</p><p>It wasn't surprising that his reaction was over the top, given Jiang Juan's vicious mind and the severe beating he had received last night. Xue Congjun was forced to be cautious.</p><p>"Your servant has seen Prince Consort Liuyi," Wang Zongguan bowed and said with a smile, "Prince Consort Liuyi is being overly cautious."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still feeling hurt—he had lost his air conditioning and cola in summer and didn't want to deal with Xue Congjun. After waiting for a while, seeing Jiang Juan's listless state made Xue Congjun feel inexplicably uneasy, so he asked, "Hey, what's wrong? Are you unhappy?"</p><p>He was just afraid of being misunderstood as the culprit; he was asking out of curiosity and had no other intentions.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him slowly and leisurely.</p><p>As one of the main character teams, Prince Ling was a real treasure in the story, specifically used to lighten the mood. He was actually just a simpleton with no ulterior motives, and Jiang Juan didn't hate him; he even found him somewhat amusing.</p><p>Therefore, although he didn't really want to deal with the main character team, Jiang Juan still condescended to him, fobbing him off with, "I'm feeling a bit unwell."</p><p>Xue Congyun responded with an "oh," as he had heard his elder brother mention that Jiang Juan had heart disease. Xue Congyun continued questioning, "What about your hand? Could it be someone bullied you?"</p><p>He didn't say anything; even Jiang Juan himself had forgotten. He lowered his head; his hand and wrist were red, looking quite painful, but in reality, he had no more sensation of pain. He shook his head, "No."</p><p>Xue Congyun was not convinced. If he hadn't been bullied, why would he be moping around here so glumly?</p><p>Although Xue Congyun was often clueless, he had a strong sense of justice. Thus, he firmly stated, "My elder brother said that day you invited him to the lake; you must have planned it ahead."</p><p>"I don't think you're that stupid," Xue Congyun scrutinized Jiang Juan curiously, "You've been avoiding my question for so long — although I do hate you, I distinguish between public and private. If you really were bullied, I could still make an exception to help you out."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Does the main character know that you're this kind of two-faced?</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Jiang Juan truthfully replied, "It was accidentally squeezed by the Prince."</p><p>Xue Congyun fell silent for a few seconds before smoothly changing his tone, "...Just pretend nothing happened."</p><p>Moments ago he was a beacon of righteousness; hearing it was Schu Fangli made him turn into a flinching chick. Jiang Juan couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>Xue Congyun also valued his reputation and felt somewhat embarrassed and angry. He glared fiercely, only to immediately cool down when met with Jiang Juan's amused gaze.</p><p>Damn, so handsome.</p><p>Originally, she was as beautiful as a celestial being, and her smile made her even more attractive.</p><p>"No, no."</p><p>He could not be tempted by her beauty.</p><p>The true beauty was his cousin, who was both physically appealing and virtuous, with inner and outer graces. Jiang Juan was only superficially beautiful; he was a fake beauty.</p><p>Xue Congyun struggled hard.</p><p>After a long time, Xue Congyun finally straightened up and hesitated before getting to the point, "Hey, what about the shell pendant I gave you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Shell pendant? What kind of bird?</p><p>He looked bewildered. Xue Congyun reminded him, "A piece of jade carved into a small bird, looking and feeling like pearls."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Congyun held back his frustration, "My fifth brother gave it to you last night. Didn't he send all the gifts there? I included my shell pendant with them too."</p><p>Jiang Juan fell silent.</p><p>What should he say? Those boxes of gifts were so abundant that he hadn't even read through the list; he certainly didn't notice the shell pendant.</p><p>However, out of social courtesy, Jiang Juan still cooperated and said, "I remember now."</p><p>Xue Congyun stared at him with great anticipation, his eyes urging him to speak, but Jiang Juan had nothing more to say. Xue Congyun, unwilling to give up, hinted at him again, "Don't you have anything to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was confused, "Say what?"</p><p>Certainly, I will praise it to the skies! Xue Congjun's vanity was not satisfied. He took a deep breath and started putting on an air of superiority again, "You, a country bumpkin, have never seen such good things before, right?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had never even seen a freshwater mussel, let alone compare it with anything else. After hesitating for a few seconds, he said in a laid-back manner, "... You are right."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "?"</p><p>Hesitation! Damn, you actually dared to hesitate!</p><p>Forget about immortals; if the Heavenly King or Laozi were here, Xue Congjun would have had shark heart.</p><p>"Do you know how difficult it is to raise a freshwater mussel?" Xue Congjun was emotionally agitated. "Fishermen put in a sign inside the shell and have to wait for many years to cultivate it like a pearl. There are only a few such pearls in the whole world!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Oh, I see. That makes sense. I understand."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "... "</p><p>He felt as though he had been fooled again.</p><p>The more Xue Congjun thought about it, the angrier he got—he had finally managed to obtain this treasure and handed it over, but the other party did not recognize its value, didn't even praise him, and actually brushed him off.</p><p>"My freshwater mussel is not a good thing. Then what do you think is a good thing?" Xue Congjun was extremely annoyed. "Forget it. Even if you have seen something more precious than a freshwater mussel, I still have something better."</p><p>"You wait!"</p><p>After holding back for so long, Xue Congjun squeezed out three words through his teeth. He had so many treasures in his warehouse; he didn't believe he couldn't pick the best one to send to Jiang Juan and broaden his horizons.</p><p>His damned competitive spirit!</p><p>Xue Congjun stormed off angrily, completely forgetting his original intention of squatting on Jiang Juan—to touch his freshwater mussel one last time, even to place a few more treasures next to it.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and did not follow his anger; even if she followed, she would still be angry. Was the Sixth Prince a spirit of a pufferfish, sulking all day long?</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him and continued to quietly blow in the wind. She felt that it was time to return, but today she was clearly very unlucky. After walking past Xue Congjun, she encountered Duke of Ping.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Sigh, bad luck.</p><p>She had intended to act as if she hadn't seen him and walk past directly, but Duke of Ping called out to her, "Princess Consort."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only stop and greet him, "Your Excellency."</p><p>Duke of Ping looked at her with a complex expression.</p><p>When alone with Emperor Hongxing, he had actually become distracted by Jiang Juan and did not insist on forcing the emperor to grant him a marriage.</p><p>He thought it was guilt.</p><p>In the past, whenever she saw him, Jiang Juan would nervously lower her head and carefully approach him to flatter him. Her current polite yet distant attitude was like night and day compared to before.</p><p>If he had not known that she still retained the jade pendant and witnessed their interactions with King Li, Duke of Ping would have thought she had finally given up or completely let go.</p><p>Yes, that was none other than King Li.</p><p>Even the Empress could not ingratiate herself in front of him; how much more so Jiang Juan. He feared her and dared not provoke her in any way, nor dare to reveal his feelings—it made perfect sense.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Duke of Ping quietly asked Jiang Juan, "Do you blame me?"</p><p>This marriage was supposed to fall on Jiang Niantou. It was Duke of Ping and Secretary Jiang who worked together to negotiate it, with the First Prince also contributing significantly. This was what finally convinced Emperor Hongxing to agree and change it to Jiang Juan.</p><p>He knew that Jiang Juan had feelings for him, but he could do nothing about it.</p><p>"No."</p><p>How could Jiang Juan hate the Marquis of Anping? If not for them, Jiang Juan would not have married Prince Li and become a eunuch. He sincerely said, "I want to thank you."</p><p>The answer was unexpected. The Marquis of Anping frowned after hearing him and then confidently stated, "You resent me in your heart."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He didn't, really didn't.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at the Marquis of Anping curiously and did not wish to deal with him anymore. He tried to leave but was grabbed by the wrist by the Marquis of Anping.</p><p>The Marquis of Anping pursed his lips.</p><p>Just now, Jiang Juan's gaze had inexplicably angered him.</p><p>That clarity, filled with indifference.</p><p>It was entirely different from his previous gloominess. Moreover, the Marquis of Anping did not see any hint of affection in his eyes; only an avoidance towards himself.</p><p>Jiang Juan instinctively struggled. The Marquis of Anping realized something was amiss and let go of his wrist, switching to grabbing his sleeve instead. Jiang Juan's wrist was exposed, showing alarming red finger marks.</p><p>The Marquis of Anping was stunned, "Is it the Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him and said, "Let go."</p><p>If it was just a guess before, now the Marquis of Anping was completely certain.</p><p>Jiang Juan had not been treated well in Prince Li's residence.</p><p>It was easy to guess. Prince Li was that kind of person; he was inherently cruel and enjoyed tormenting others.</p><p>Suddenly, his unprovoked anger dissipated. Duke Ping of An apologized, "Marrying into the Wang Family is my fault."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...No, you aren't."</p><p>His scalp tingled; he didn't know what Duke Ping of An was doing. He only felt that this man was sticky and annoying, repeating the same idea.</p><p>—You're just saying it out of frustration; I don't believe you.</p><p>But Jiang Juan really wasn't angry. His mindset had changed, and after dying once, he valued his life and knew that getting angry wasn't worth it. What would he do if anger made him sick?</p><p>Who was Prince Li? How could Duke Ping of An be unaware? He had interacted with Prince Li before and knew how dangerous and brutal this man was.</p><p>Duke Ping of An said, "You don't need to say so. Prince Li is insane, cruel, and vicious; I know him better than you do."</p><p>But hearing was believing to a lesser extent than seeing. Moreover, Jiang Juan wasn't unfamiliar with Xue Fangli. He didn't want to continue this argument with Duke Ping of An and tried to pull away again, "Your Excellency, be careful with your words."</p><p>Duke Ping of An looked at him for a long time, assuming he was afraid, "Jiang Juan, you——"</p><p>"No matter how I act, I can never match Your Excellency's backroom gossip."</p><p>Duke Ping of An's expression changed.</p><p>Xue Fangli paused for a moment before saying leisurely, "Your Excellency has said so much but forgot that Third Young Master is this prince's legally wedded wife."</p><p>Duke Ping of An froze.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with what seemed like kind advice, "Your Excellency, your hand."</p><p>Anping Marquis Fang did not release him, nor did he not release him; instead, Jiang Juan seized the opportunity to reclaim it and felt unlucky.</p><p>Colliding with Anping Marquis and being caught on the spot by Xue Fangli, would the Young Master misunderstand?</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan shot several glances at him, his eyes moist.</p><p>Putting on a spoiled act?</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and naturally noticed Jiang Juan's little movements. He frowned and finally spoke again.</p><p>"Your Majesty is known for being frivolous, cruel, and vicious; Marquis, you must pay more attention in the future," Xue Fangli said with a slow smile, "Should this happen again, Your Majesty might just want your entire hand."</p>
