						<p>Regardless of what kind of peacock it is, Xue Congjun now felt restless. He forced himself to say, "Fifth Brother, you guys see, I'm leaving first."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, "Where are you going? Let's have our meal together."</p><p>Xue Congjun was extremely afraid of Xue Fangli; he was scary even when not smiling, and even more so when he did. Xue Congjun shook his head vigorously, "No, really, no need."</p><p>He felt guilty at this moment and feared punishment, wishing he could run away immediately. However, Xue Fangli didn't seem to want to let him go, so he was left stiff in place.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't notice the brewing tension. When Xue Congjun said he was leaving, she politely bid him farewell, "Be careful on your way."</p><p>Afterwards, Jiang Juan asked Xue Congjun, "Your Majesty, is it time for our meal?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded once and finally stopped looking at Xue Congjun. Xue Congjun breathed a sigh of relief; there was no better time to leave than now. He turned around to make his escape, but then—</p><p>"If you don't behave properly in the future, this king has plenty of time to teach you manners."</p><p>Xue Congjun froze, nodding like a chick pecking for food. At least this time he wasn't stopped; he fled with his tail between his legs, grateful once again to Jiang Juan.</p><p>His fifth brother clearly didn't plan on letting him off easily, but since Jiang Juan had already said goodbye, it would be disrespectful not to show some courtesy to his wife. That's why his fifth brother finally let him go.</p><p>Xue Congjun couldn't help but grumble.</p><p>He only accidentally scared someone; his fifth brother, however, was kind enough to leave the person injured, today the wrist, tomorrow the foot, who knew what it would be after that.</p><p>Thinking about this, Xue Congjun felt even more sympathetic. He decided to rest for a few days and then visit Jiang Juan again, bringing him several treasures.</p><p>Marrying his fifth brother was too miserable.</p><p>What could alleviate his troubles? Only treasures.</p><p>Jiang Juan had no idea of Xue Congjun's sympathy; he was only curious about the peacock mentioned in Zhuangzi. So as soon as the dishes were served, he started eating.</p><p>The only bad thing was that Xue Fangli held him in his lap again.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He looked up at Xue Fangli and said sincerely, "Your Highness, I can sit by myself."</p><p>Xue Fangli simply replied, "This is more convenient."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Convenient for what?</p><p>Soon he found out the answer. Lan Ting was still stirring crab roe into the rice porridge, while Xue Fangli had already peeled a lychee and intended to feed it to Jiang Juan.</p><p>He barely used chopsticks himself but loved watching Jiang Juan eat and even enjoyed feeding him personally. Seeing that Xue Fangli had peeled the fruit, Jiang Juan could only open his mouth to take a bite.</p><p>"It's very sweet," Jiang Juan said.</p><p>"Just arrived," Xue Fangli plucked another one and said indifferently, "Open your mouth."</p><p>He was about to feed Jiang Juan again when Jiang Juan took the peeled lychee and raised his hand to offer it to him, "You try one."</p><p>The fruit flesh was white and translucent, and the young man's fingers were also pale. Only the fingertips holding the fruit were a beautiful pink, making it momentarily impossible to determine which was more appetizing.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at it for a few moments without speaking. If Gao Guanshi had been there, he would certainly have stepped in to smooth things over.</p><p>The Prince did not like sweet foods and rarely indulged in them.</p><p>Since he was not around, the maids were even more cautious and kept their heads lowered. Jiang Juan, however, was determined to share with him, "It's really sweet, you should try it."</p><p>After a moment, Xue Fangli genuinely tasted it and Jiang Juan looked at him in utter shock.</p><p>Now I will pass this draft to the senior proofreader for further refinement.</p><p>The flesh of the fruit and Jiang Juan's fingers were both bitten into his mouth.</p><p>His teeth lightly ground over, not painful but slightly itchy. The damp breath brushed past, scorching Jiang Juan’s finger, causing a slight twitch.</p><p>"W-wang…"</p><p>"It is very sweet."</p><p>Xue Fangli finished speaking and calmly met Jiang Juan's gaze.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never experienced such a scene; he was initially quite nervous. Seeing Xue Fangli's expression eased his anxiety slightly. He said, "Oh," then stirred the well-mixed crab meat congee.</p><p>The youth lowered his head, his eyelashes also gently drooping. Perhaps it was his obedience or perhaps his breath, Xue Fangli's agitation completely dissipated, and his mood returned to calmness.</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli casually opened his mouth again, "This Wang will trade something else for that emerald peacock, what do you think?"</p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Juan raised his head. "The peacock given by the Sixth Prince?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and nodded, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan took out the emerald peacock. This piece of jade had excellent clarity and translucency, seeming to contain a pool of water. Although it had many colors, they were not chaotic but instead perfectly showcased the magnificent feathers when the peacock spreads its screen.</p><p>He looked down at it for quite some time without responding. Xue Fangli silently smiled, his gaze becoming increasingly dangerous.</p><p>Are you unwilling to part with it?</p><p>Do you like it so much?</p><p>"No need to trade," Jiang Juan shook his head and said with a twinkling eye, "If Wang wants it, take it."</p><p>As the words fell, Jiang Juan hesitated slightly before adding, "However… Your Highness has poor health. I remember your hand feeling very cold when we met earlier. You shouldn't play with jade too often."</p><p>Xue Fali froze.</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>Jiang Juan placed it beside him and started drinking his porridge. He was still thinking about the live peacock and wanted to see it spread its tail feathers.</p><p>After a long time, Xue Fali said, "Don't you want to know what this king is going to do with it?"</p><p>"Why should I ask?" Jiang Juan looked at him in confusion and said seriously, "Anyway, I'll give everything to Your Majesty."</p><p>Xue Fali lifted his eyelids. After a while, he asked gently, "Whatever this king wants, will you give it to me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was just a salted fish; of course, he would give whatever the king wanted. He said honestly, "Yes."</p><p>Xue Fali didn't say anything more and simply picked up the jade peacock on the table, rubbing his pale fingers against it a few times as he felt the residual warmth left by Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Fali lazily parted his lips and said contentedly, "Whatever you want, this king will give it to you. No need to keep these suspicious things."</p><p>After finishing his meal, it was time to see the peacock. Jiang Juan washed his hands clean, "Your Majesty, I'm ready."</p><p>Xue Fali nodded and looked at the high official inquiringly.</p><p>——Not long ago, he had rushed back just in time to find the peacock.</p><p>The high official wiped the sweat off his forehead, "Your Majesty and Lady, this way please."</p><p>Jiang Juan still couldn't get out of bed. Xue Fali bent down to carry him. Although he didn't know where the peacock was kept, it definitely wasn't close by. Jiang Juan hesitated and said, "Your Majesty…"</p><p>"It's not necessary."</p><p>The words were not yet finished, Xue Fangli had already replied. Jiang Juan looked at him with a complicated expression and sighed, "Alright."</p><p>The Prince's pride was also quite strong.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>What Jiang Juan was thinking was crystal clear to him. He said with a half-smile, "Hold me tighter. If this prince loses strength on the way, you might get hurt if you fall down."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed "Ah," believing it to be true, and he tightened his arms around Xue Fangli slightly, pressing his forehead against the other's shoulder.</p><p>Xue Fangli had intended to scare him, but Jiang Juan, nervous, hugged him tightly, making Xue Fangli hold him in a full embrace. He suddenly realized that this was not so bad.</p><p>When they arrived, the soft bed and low table were set up, layered with silk and brocade for sufficient comfort. Xue Fangli then sat down holding Jiang Juan.</p><p>Not far away, three peacocks walked around the open space, none of them spreading their tails.</p><p>Jiang Juan only glanced at them before the low table was filled with snacks by the maidservants. He had just finished his meal and naturally could not eat more, but Xue Fangli continued to peel lychees for him.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Eat."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He shook his head desperately, "I can't eat anymore, you eat it yourself."</p><p>"Not hungry," Xue Fangli said coolly, "but watching you eat makes this prince find it quite amusing."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...But I really can't eat anymore."</p><p>His tone was soft, with a hint of unintentional grievance. Xue Fangli chuckled, "Don't you like it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan despairingly replied, "Even if I like it, I can't keep eating."</p><p>Xue Fangli only gave up then, no longer continuing to feed Jiang Juan.</p><p>A few peacocks were still walking around the field, dragging their tails and calling loudly, but they refused to spread their screens.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Juan knew that a peacock spreading its screen was not something one could see at will. Xue Fangli, however, intermittently tapped on the low table, growing increasingly impatient as the person in his arms could not be fed, and the peacocks were unwilling to display their screens.</p><p>Seeing this, Gao Jiangshi hurriedly said, "Your Highness, I heard that peacocks can also spread their screens when teased. Should I have someone tease them?"</p><p>Xue Fangli was indifferent, replying with a mere, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment before still blocking, "… Don't do it."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and asked, "Why not?"</p><p>Peacocks spread their screens either to court or because they were frightened. Jiang Juan whispered softly, "They will be scared."</p><p>Xue Fangli's movements paused as he asked him, "Didn't you want to see it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did want to see it, but he had patience and was willing to wait patiently. He said, "Mm, I do want to see it, but if they don't spread their screens, that's fine too."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids and looked at him.</p><p>How could he forget that no matter how obedient and soft the youth in his arms was, he also had a heart as compassionate as that of a Bodhisattva.</p><p>Almost compassionately kind, and clean to the point of seeming devoid of desire.</p><p>— He liked lychees but would not indulge without restraint; he liked peacocks but did not necessarily need to see them spread their screens; he even accepted jade peacocks without question.</p><p>He liked everything, yet he disliked everything.</p><p>Xue Fangli inexplicably felt irritable. He suddenly pinched Jiang Juan's chin, forcing him to look up and meet his gaze.</p><p>Jiang Juan froze, "Your Highness..."</p><p>It was so clean, too clean.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked into his eyes but said nothing. He stared at Jiang Juan indifferently, feeling the smooth texture of his skin, and then pressed a bit harder.</p><p>"It hurts."</p><p>Jiang Juan's expression was dazed, and his eyelashes fluttered lightly a few times. He could sense Xue Fangli's anger but was unsure of the reason.</p><p>Was it because of the peacock?</p><p>Or did he not want him to feed it again?</p><p>But—</p><p>Your Highness is such a kind person; he shouldn't be angry.</p><p>Jiang Juan remained dazed. Despite the pain, he didn't show any signs of frustration and instead asked Xue Fangli curiously, "Your Highness, what's wrong?"</p><p>He knew nothing.</p><p>Or rather—</p><p>He cared about nothing.</p><p>Jiang Juan's cluelessness only made Xue Fangli more irritated. He looked at Jiang Juan expressionlessly and suddenly remembered the words he had just said.</p><p>He would give the youth whatever he wanted.</p><p>So, what exactly did he want?</p><p>He wanted...</p><p>Xue Fali closed his eyes, but the woman's screams suddenly echoed in his mind.</p><p>—"Desire for a person is like holding a torch. Going against the wind... there must be the danger of burning one's hand, ha, there must be the danger of burning one's hand!"</p><p>Xue Fali paused and abruptly stood up.</p><p>The intricate robes fell to the ground, he retracted his hand, Xue Fali lowered his eyelids without another glance at Jiang Juan, simply saying coolly, "This king has other matters to attend to; I'll leave first."</p>
