						<p>Jiang Juan collapsed on the soft bed, staring blankly as Xue Fangli left. He slowly knitted his eyebrows.</p><p>The Prince would not be so petty.</p><p>He did not want to eat lychees anymore and stopped them from teasing the peacock. The Prince should not get angry over this.</p><p>So... what was going on?</p><p>After thinking for a while, Jiang Juan could not figure it out. He looked down at the platter of lychees and suddenly remembered Xue Congjun's reminder.</p><p>The memorial day.</p><p>It was nearing the memorial day for the Prince's mother, Beauty Yu.</p><p>Could that be the reason?</p><p>Jiang Juan fell deep in thought. The Head of Palace Affairs seemed to take it as a matter of course, after all, this capricious behavior was the Prince's usual demeanor. However, this should be the first time the Princess Consort had been treated so coldly.</p><p>The Head of Palace Affairs pretended not to see anything and said to Jiang Juan, "Princess Consort, look at that blue peacock. Is it about to spread its tail feathers?"</p><p>No matter how beautiful the peacock's display was, Jiang Juan had no mood to appreciate it now. He shook his head.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Jiang Juan asked the Head of Palace Affairs, "Does the Prince always feel bad around this time?"</p><p>"... The memorial day for Beauty Yu."</p><p>The Head of Palace Affairs was taken aback and nearly forgot the date.</p><p>To say he felt bad, in fact, the Prince did not have a good day every day. But on Beauty Yu's memorial day, he would become even more ruthless.</p><p>Counting the days, it would be no more than four or five days until the end of the month. However, these few days, although the Prince was still not easy to get along with, his wildness had subsided significantly.</p><p>"Yes," the executive secretary replied, "it's really not good."</p><p>"Regarding the King's mother...," Jiang Juan hesitated in choosing his words, "can you tell me something about Yu Meiren?"</p><p>While Yu Meiren was mentioned a couple of times in the text, the main purpose was to illustrate the King's brutality—he had personally killed his mother.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan did not think it was the King. After all, none of the plot points involving the King matched up, and their characterizations were quite different.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The executive secretary recalled some rumors but was unsure and dared not say too much: "Yu Meiren was originally an orphan who met the Emperor by chance while offering incense at Miaolin Temple. The Emperor fell in love with her at first sight and brought her into the palace, where she enjoyed endless favor and honor. However—"</p><p>"One day in the afternoon, water flooded Yu Meiren's Chunshen Pavilion, and she caught a cold while resting..."</p><p>The executive secretary did not continue, but Jiang Juan guessed the ending; he was somewhat shocked.</p><p>She was burned to death alive.</p><p>It must have been terribly painful.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed, deeply sympathizing with Yu Meiren's fate. He then thought of Xue Falili.</p><p>Given how cruelly Yu Meiren died, Xue Falili likely felt terrible as well. Jiang Juan came from a happy family and had never experienced such an event, but he imagined that if something like this happened to him, he would be extremely upset, possibly unable to come to terms with it for a long time.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan suddenly became very worried about Xue Falili.</p><p>"Your Majesty, the peacock is spreading its tail! The blue peacock has spread its tail!"</p><p>While thinking about this, the executive secretary called out for Jiang Juan to see the peacock. However, Jiang Juan was somewhat distracted and replied, "I want to see the King. Can you take me to see him?"</p><p>The executive secretary: "...Of course."</p><p>Bringing these three peacocks was quite a hassle for Gao Guanshi. He endured it, but finally couldn't hold back and struggled again, "Your Highness, look at the peacock! It has spread its tail feathers!" </p><p>Jiang Juan was worried about Xue Fali and shook her head, "Let's go."</p><p>Gao Guanshi managed a weak smile, "…Alright."</p><p>Apart from him, no one seemed to care that the peacock had spread its tail feathers.</p><p>Wu wu wu.</p><p>Xue Fali was in the study.</p><p>Since they parted ways unhappily with Jiang Juan, Gao Guanshi tried to persuade her before leaving, "Your Highness, perhaps His Majesty would like some time alone. Perhaps you could…"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated but said, "Let's stay for a while."</p><p>Gao Guanshi nodded and knocked on the door.</p><p>"His Majesty, Your Highness..."</p><p>His words were cut off. The study was filled with kneeling guards, and the air was thick with the scent of blood. Gao Guanshi froze, realizing something was wrong.</p><p>——It's time to deal with His Majesty's execution.</p><p>The last time the wolf pack invaded the manor, regardless of the reason, the guards were held accountable for dereliction of duty. However, His Majesty didn't mention it at the time and was dealing with it today.</p><p>Gao Guanshi whispered, "Your Highness has arrived."</p><p>Xue Fali said expressionlessly, "Send him back."</p><p>Jiang Juan hadn't entered yet, but she could hear what was being said inside. Of course, she refused to leave, "I'm not going back."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond, only looking at Gao Jiangshi with cold indifference, his entire body exuding malice.</p><p>Gao Jiangshi shuddered and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>"You seem unhappy," Jiang Juan said seriously, "I want to be with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli still showed no reaction, merely lowering his eyes to look at the kneeling guards—some had already been punished and were covered in blood, while many more trembled with fear on the ground, waiting for his verdict.</p><p>Letting the teenager in would probably scare him quite a bit.</p><p>Even young wolves he encountered on the road and peacocks in the courtyard, he would save them; he could not bear to see any suffering. How much more so when it came to living people.</p><p>Xue Fangli parted his red lips into a somewhat mocking smile.</p><p>He wanted to appear as a good person in front of the teenager, but at this moment, he suddenly did not want to put on that polite demeanor anymore.</p><p>"Alright," after what felt like a long time, Xue Fangli said almost viciously, "then come in."</p><p>With his words, Jiang Juan was ushered into the study.</p><p>Jiang Juan was indeed startled; he had not expected so many people to be there. Jiang Juan also caught a whiff of blood and looked curiously over, blinking but saying nothing.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan raised his head and said to Xue Fangli, "My Lord, give me your hand."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him indifferently without any intention of lifting his hand. Jiang Juan had no choice but to take his hand himself.</p><p>In the next second, something was placed in the palm of Xue Fangli's hand.</p><p>"I'm giving you a flower," Jiang Juan looked up at him and earnestly lied, "at my place, wisteria flowers are also called forget-me-nots; they consume all sorrow and unhappiness."</p><p>"Don't be unhappy."</p><p>Now the text has been translated into English by the translation expert. Please proceed with the next step as a senior copy editor for further refinement.</p><p>The young man raised his long lashes, his eyes bright and clear. His voice was soft and gentle, almost soothing. </p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him without speaking, and his hostility was completely pacified.</p><p>After a long moment, Xue Fangli finally spoke, asking Jiang Juan, "They were punished, why didn't you stop them?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him strangely, "One must face punishment for wrongdoing, and the Prince will not punish too severely."</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression remained calm, "What if this Prince punishes heavily?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head with confidence, "Prince, you are so kind and would never easily hurt anyone."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him, his brows slightly curved in a smile, but Jiang Juan felt only endless irritation.</p><p>His pale fingers fumbled a few times, crushing the petals in Xue Fangli's palm into a soft, wet mass. He lowered his head to look at it and inexplicably thought of the wet lashes of Jiang Juan.</p><p>After a while, Xue Fangli laughed softly but with evident weariness, "Yes, how could this Prince hurt anyone?"</p><p>"Get out."</p><p>He spoke calmly, and the kneeling guards trembled at his words before bowing their heads and leaving as ordered, suppressing their surprise.</p><p>The Prince would not lightly forgive them!</p><p>It was...the Princess Consort!</p><p>Jiang Juan knew nothing of this. To him, it merely confirmed once more that the Prince was a good person.</p><p>He treated him well, treating his servants generously too.</p><p>After all the guards had left and a long silence fell, Xue Fangli playfully asked Jiang Juan, "Why did you come to accompany this Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated before answering, "Your mother's memorial day seems to be approaching. I'm afraid for you..."</p><p>Xue Fangli suddenly raised his eyelids, his expression cold and indifferent.</p><p>Cining Palace.</p><p>Beneath the golden Buddha statue, incense smoke rose from the gilded censer as Empress Dowager knelt on a cushion reciting scriptures. She fiddled with the prayer beads in her hand, her demeanor deeply devout.</p><p>With a rustling sound, Jiang Nian gently turned the pages of the scripture. He picked up his brush and meticulously copied out the sutras page by page.</p><p>"Getting old," Empress Dowager opened her eyes after a while, sighing deeply. "Old people are just not as useful anymore; they can't even hold their kneels."</p><p>Jiang Nian paused his writing and hurriedly moved forward to support her, but Empress Dowager waved her hand away, only allowing the palace maid to massage her legs.</p><p>"I love children like you," Empress Dowager looked at Jiang Nian with a beaming smile. "Not restless, able to concentrate, unlike that sixth son who is always bustling around, causing trouble."</p><p>"Father often complains that I lack youthful vigor," Jiang Nian said. "He wishes I were more lively instead."</p><p>Empress Dowager shook her head and joked, "Then perhaps we should switch places."</p><p>Jiang Nian helplessly replied, "If the sixth prince hears that, he'll probably tease you again."</p><p>Empress Dowager raised her hand, with the palace maid assisting her to stand. She let out a soft hum, "Let him tease if he wants to; I only want a well-behaved grandson, not this naughty monkey."</p><p>Jiang Nian looked at Empress Dowager and smiled faintly.</p><p>In his previous life, after Prince Li died, Jiang Nian had inadvertently encountered Empress Dowager at Zhaoan Temple. Unfortunately, at that time he was still Consort Li, and Empress Dowager hated him as an extension of her hatred for Consort Li.</p><p>——It seems there was some enmity between Empress Dowager and the late Yu Meiniang.</p><p>After his reincarnation, Jiang Nian anticipated this and knew that every Buddha's birthday, Empress Dowager would visit Zhaoan Temple. Thus, he went to Zhaoan Temple on this day as well. Jiang Nian pretended not to recognize Empress Dowager, engaging her in discussions about scriptures and even transcribing sutras for her, which earned him a favorable impression.</p><p>"You have written increasingly beautifully," the Empress Dowager looked down at Jiang Nian's transcription of the Buddhist scripture and praised, "like flowing clouds and water, dragons floating and phoenixes drifting."</p><p>"One of my younger brothers writes even better than I do," Jiang Nian’s eyes flickered as he softly said, "He writes in a slender golden script, with sharp and slender brushstrokes that are both clear and delicate."</p><p>"Oh?" The Empress Dowager became interested, "I have never heard you mention your brother. Who is it? Perhaps this old woman knows him."</p><p>"Jiang Juan," Jiang Nian smiled, "has the Empress Dowager ever heard of him?"</p><p>"No," after some thought, the Empress Dowager had no impression, "If he truly writes so well, I shall call him to the palace another day to take a look."</p><p>"My brother has suffered from heart disease since childhood and has been convalescing in the countryside. As he has plenty of free time, he has put considerable effort into practicing his calligraphy," Jiang Nian was speaking when suddenly something occurred to him, causing him to hesitate, "Empress Dowager..."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Nian hesitated, "My brother is now the Concubine of Li Wang..."</p><p>With a snap, the Empress Dowager lost her strength, breaking the rosary beads which rolled onto the ground. Her smile slowly faded from her face.</p><p>"The Concubine of Li Wang," the Empress Dowager said, "then this old woman must call him to the palace for a thorough inspection."</p><p>Seeing the situation, the maid hurriedly knelt down to pick up the beads. As she watched, the Empress Dowager seemed lost in thought, "If I remember correctly, it is his mother's memorial day in a few days."</p><p>"That wild brat will surely go to Miao Ling Temple to pay respects."</p><p>The Empress Dowager’s expression turned cold, "Very well. For how long he pays respects at Miao Ling Temple, his Concubine shall kneel before this old woman for the same duration in the palace."</p>
