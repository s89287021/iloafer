						<p>The Empress Dowager is currently in a very fānàomiào mood.</p><p>Jiang Juan was lying on the table with his long hair cascading like a waterfall. He was focused on qì, while Lan Ting picked up a comb and gently combed through his hair for him. Jiang Juan muttered, "Lying again, Prince Wang is lying."</p><p>He suddenly turned his head and asked gloomily, "Lan Ting, are you that easy to deceive?"</p><p>Lan Ting jumped in surprise. Before she could retract the comb, her reaction was too slow and she almost tore a strand of black hair. Helplessly, she said, "Child, be careful, if you pull your hair again, you'll feel jūntòng all over. You'll cry again, and I won't be able to comfort you."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Juan felt even more gloomy, "I'm not that easily cried."</p><p>Lan Ting: "..."</p><p>She opened her mouth, about to speak but hesitated, finally cooperating and saying, "Also, Child, you're not that easily cried."</p><p>After a moment's pause, Lan Ting examined Jiang Juan's yǎn face. His young face was extremely měi, like the moon or snow, dreamlike and ethereal, akin to the smoke of a bōqín meal.</p><p>How could the fairies on the Jade Pool understand the cruelty of the world?</p><p>Lan Ting smiled and said tactfully, "Child has a pure xìng and trusts Prince Wang immensely, sù..."</p><p>Jiang Juan explained, "I just feel that trust should be maintained between guān and guān."</p><p>Lan Ting shook her head. Before she could say anything else, the door was suddenly knocked on. She hurriedly put down the comb and rushed over.</p><p>When the door opened, Lan Ting saw who it was and froze for a moment before turning back to say, "Child, Prince Wang is here."</p><p>Jiang Juan simply replied, "Tell him to leave."</p><p>Of course, Lan Ting wasn't dare to speak to Xue Fangli like that. She hesitated and said, "Prince..."</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>Male voice was bland, with no hint of joy.</p><p>Lanting secretly glanced at him. The Prince was drenched in moisture, his hair still dripping water droplets as if he had pursued him the moment he heard that Jiang Juan had stormed off.</p><p>That day, Lanting had made a mistake and befriended one of the young ladies at Li Mansion. Through their conversations, Lanting learned about the Prince's deeds, only then realizing how far off her son's perception of the Prince was from reality.</p><p>No matter how wrong they were, the Prince truly treated his own son with genuine kindness. Lanting naturally did not comment further, especially when she could see that even in front of his son, the Prince suppressed any anger he might have had.</p><p>When his son flew into a rage, the Prince came over.</p><p>Lanting sneaked a smile and turned to look back. Jiang Juan was still lying on the table, facing away from Lanting with a window in front of him. The dim firelight inside the room cast shadows that swayed lightly.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not move, showing no intention of responding, until the male voice spoke thoughtfully again.</p><p>"Want to see me?" Schu Fangli's tone was one of regret. "Then this Wang will leave first. When you've calmed down, I'll come find you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>How could he be so unreasonable?</p><p>Jiang Juan gritted his teeth and turned away in anger, only to meet a pair of smiling eyes. Schu Fangli looked leisurely at him, seemingly ready to leave but not showing any intention of doing so.</p><p>Lanting's body stiffened as she suddenly realized something.</p><p>Damn it, he had tricked her again.</p><p>The Prince was too cunning.</p><p>"Why are you so angry?" Schu Fangli asked with a light laugh.</p><p>Already furious, the Prince added fuel to the fire. Jiang Juan turned around, determined not to reason with him anymore, and raised his hand to cover his ears.</p><p>Xue Fangli found it amusing, his lips curling into a smile. In an instant, he did not speak again.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Lanting whispered, "Your Highness, he…"</p><p>Those who had covered their ears spoke up again, and Jiang Juan shouted at her, "Lanting, don't talk to him; he'll just lie."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Fangli was not offended in the slightest but merely smiled at Jiang Juan.</p><p>With a sigh, he might give him some possessions or speak to him, but he truly despised him very much.</p><p>He glanced at Jiang Juan and lifted his foot. Instead of entering the room, Xue Fangli walked out.</p><p>In the next second, the window was pulled open from outside, and Jiang Juan's hands were grabbed, gently pressed down by his side.</p><p>"I come to take you back."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to reclaim his hand, but although Xue Fangli did not seem to be exerting much force, he could not escape. Glancing at him with a hint of amusement, Jiang Juan said happily, "Let's go."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Why?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Seeing you makes me angry."</p><p>Xue Fangli slowly replied, "It doesn't matter. You usually lie in this king's arms and see him even when asleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>"Alright," Jiang Juan said lazily, "I'll sleep here tonight."</p><p>"That's fine," Xue Fangli's expression changed, "This king will stay with you tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He bizarrely asked, “How are you? Alright, if you insist on sleeping here and I didn’t agree, you would sleep alone tonight, and only then would we sleep together.”</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned and then sternly asked, “If this royal one falls asleep and the old disease recurs?”</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback; he had forgotten about it. He hesitated immediately, and Xue Fangli saw his reaction, lifting the corner of his lips slightly.</p><p>"Forget it," Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "if you truly wish to see this royal one, I will sleep alone tonight."</p><p>"This royal one has not coughed up blood for a long time; on my own, there should be no major issue."</p><p>Jiang Juan: “…”</p><p>Indeed, the prince did not cough up blood that day, but such matters could never be certain. The prince had not fallen ill in a long time, but he could not guarantee that everything would be fine tonight.</p><p>Although Jiang Juan was angry, his concern was real. He furrowed his brows and hesitated again.</p><p>Providing sleeping service was one thing, but what if the prince fell ill while sleeping alone?</p><p>He did not want to be widowed either, imagining how happy he could be after the prince passed away. However, being widowed would only be possible if the prince managed to survive on his own, and not die due to carelessness.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into deep thought and after a long time, he said, “…”</p><p>His attitude seemed to soften, which made Xue Fangli feel quite pleased, though he did not show it on his face. Instead, he spoke softly, "You must be worried about this royal one. Tonight, you can sleep alone to rest."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Rest?</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Juan recalled two days ago when the prince admitted that on their wedding day, he had deliberately shot an arrow at him and intentionally let it barely miss him, scaring Jiang Juan badly.</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly lifted her head.</p><p>With a "bang," she shook off Xue Fangli's hand, quickly closing the window and locking it. New grievances added to old grudges— Jiang Juan, who had been deceived, would no longer accompany him in bed.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Looking at the closed window, his brow slightly twitched, somewhat surprised that Jiang Juan actually fell for this trick.</p><p>But soon, Xue Fangli realized the problem. He sighed softly, looking regretful.</p><p>——Tonight I really did have someone to keep me company.</p><p>Knowing he had overstayed his welcome, Xue Fangli planned to return to Liangfeng Manor. But before he could take a step, with a creak, the door opened and Lanting rushed over.</p><p>"Your Highness."</p><p>Xue Fangli paused, lifting his eyes in a carefree manner.</p><p>He had arrived hastily, still damp from water droplets, his black wet hair and red lips looking extremely vivid. At this moment, with Jiang Juan present, he no longer deliberately contained the hostility on his body, making him appear cold and sticky in the night air.</p><p>Lanting shivered, feeling like the man before her was completely different from earlier. She dared not look at him for long and quickly bowed her head, whispering softly, "Son, Son, please don't forget to have someone guard you tonight, so you won't really cough up blood again."</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed carelessly, "This King knows."</p><p>No matter how they quarreled, she still worried about him.</p><p>But was this worry enough?</p><p>Smelling the scent of youth, unable to hold it close, this mere worry could not satisfy his craving in the slightest.</p><p>Think of a way, make him happy as soon as possible.</p><p>He was difficult to soothe, really testing his patience. Sch Fanli lowered his eyes in deep thought.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Amidst the pain he could bear, staying up late and waking up early, he had been nominated multiple times.</p><p>When Jiang Juan was dragged out of bed, he felt dazed. Lan Ting made him drink some saliva, which barely brought him back to consciousness. He asked, "Who did you say came?"</p><p>Lan Ting: "From the main residence."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked again, "What about the Prince?"</p><p>Lan Ting replied, "The steward said that the Prince left early and hasn't returned yet. You were supposed to go see him."</p><p>Jiang Juan fell back uncomfortably. He knew he had to act like a princess consort even if it meant going through the motions. Lan Ting pulled him up and said with amusement, "Son, you can sleep when you come back."</p><p>Sleeping when he came back? That would only be possible if he returned first. Jiang Juan was still feeling sleepy. He said helplessly, "So early, where did the Prince go?"</p><p>How could Lan Ting know? She shook her head, "I didn't ask. You can ask the steward later."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh" and reluctantly got out of bed. After tidying up a bit, he left.</p><p>"The old slave has seen the Princess Consort."</p><p>The high steward took the invitation and passed it to Jiang Juan. The eunuch continued, "The banquet is scheduled for the 15th day. Both the Princess Consort and the Prince must attend. Our master was so pleased to hear about their marriage that he stayed up half the night talking about it."</p><p>Jiang Juan was too sleepy to read the invitation carefully. He said offhandedly, "Okay, I'll go."</p><p>He smiled. The letter was delivered, and he did not need to stay any longer. He politely bowed his farewell as the executive secretary saw him off all the way.</p><p>After business hours, Jiang Juan put down the letter, wanting only to go back and take a nap. However, before she could even take a step, the executive secretary ran back.</p><p>"Princess Wang!"</p><p>He was holding something in his hands. Seeing Jiang Juan, he hurriedly handed it over to her, "Quickly try this wistaria cake."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not think much about it and took it from him. The wistaria cake was still warm; she bent down to smell it, filled with the scent of flowers. Jiang Juan took a bite.</p><p>It smelled so good.</p><p>The wistaria cake smelled delicious and tasted just as good. It was the flavor Jiang Juan loved—sweet and delicious. She took another bite subconsciously and asked, "Did the chef you brought back last night make this?"</p><p>The executive secretary hesitated, "…Maybe."</p><p>Yeah, maybe, he said maybe, which puzzled Jiang Juan. She looked at him and did not ask further. However, Lanting immediately recognized it, "Is this the wistaria cake from Tao Su Ji?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes in surprise, "Tao Su Ji?"</p><p>Lanting nodded, "The chef of Tao Su Ji was previously a court cook for the late emperor, specializing in making small snacks. After the late emperor's passing, he left the palace and opened this shop called Tao Su Ji."</p><p>"This wistaria cake is only available in April. The filling uses morning dew-covered wistaria flowers, and the water comes from snow collected on plum blossoms. One must queue up early every day; otherwise, it’s impossible to get one."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, "Then this wistaria cake…"</p><p>The prince had already left for the day, could it be that he bought this wistaria cake just for her?</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down at the cake and asked the executive secretary softly, "Did the prince buy it?"</p><p>The executive secretary frowned deeply, wanting to say something but then closed his mouth again, giving off an air of reluctance. Jiang Juan held back from asking him further and said, "What do you want to say?"</p><p>"Ah, Consort, Your Highness, said something, and I wanted to say."</p><p>Gao Jigong sighed. By saying this, it clearly showed that the mandarin duck pastry was specially bought for him by His Highness.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked after hearing this. He gently pinched the mandarin duck pastry and slowly asked, "What about Your Highness?"</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Gao Jigong started mumbling again. He glanced at Jiang Juan, feeling quite guilty, although that guilt was fleeting, as Gao Jigong gritted his teeth in the next second and said to Jiang Juan, "Your Highness might think me overly talkative, but I wanted to ease your worries. After much consideration, I decided to tell you."</p><p>"Last night, Your Highness couldn't sleep all night. When Consort got very angry at His Highness, he asked how to appease her. I suggested that he buy this mandarin duck pastry for you, but ——"</p><p>Gao Jigong sighed and said, "When Your Highness went out, it was raining a bit, and He might have caught a chill. As soon as he returned, He started coughing up blood again."</p>
