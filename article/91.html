						<p>Deng Jun was busy grooming herself when You finally agreed to it. </p><p>Agreed?</p><p>His Majesty the Prince actually agreed?</p><p>The wolf pup jumped into the carriage. It wasn't a huge matter, but neither was it insignificant. For others, someone pleading for mercy and granting it was just a simple sentence. However, this time it was Xue Fangli.</p><p>Their His Majesty the Prince had never been so accommodating before.</p><p>What Senior High didn't expect was that this was just the beginning; there were even more shocking things to come.</p><p>"His Majesty will spare its life now, but even if it recovers and is sent back to the forest later, it will still not survive," Xue Fangli's voice was slow and calm. "His Majesty never does anything without meaning."</p><p>Jiang Juan finally relaxed but then tensed up again, "Then..."</p><p>"Bring it back to the palace," Xue Fangli said matter-of-factly. "Since His Majesty has spared its life, it cannot die again."</p><p>With that, he casually ordered, "Gao De, find a veterinarian for it."</p><p>Senior High: "?"</p><p>He was stunned for a long time and even doubted if he had woken up properly. He pinched himself hard, and Senior High winced in pain, realizing with despair that this wasn't a dream. He quickly responded, "...Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and then opened his eyes wide in surprise. He didn't expect things to turn around so unexpectedly. He said seriously, "Your Majesty, you are really a good person."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him with an ambiguous smile, "Is that so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded without hesitation. Looking back at Xue Fangli, his gaze was clean and pure, filled with trust as if he believed it wholeheartedly.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "You got it wrong."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not explain; he only raised his hand, and the distinct knuckles of his fingers landed on Jiang Juan's face. Jiang Juan was bewildered and stared at him blankly.</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored her confusion. He used the pad of his thumb to wipe away a faint blush from the youth's forehead, then lowered his head and examined it closely for a moment before saying regretfully, "Indeed, he is a little Bodhisattva."</p><p>As the blood was wiped away, the youth seemed to ascend instantly, standing like a bodhi tree, untainted by dust.</p><p>Unfortunately, the little Bodhisattva mistook an evil spirit for a good person. And he—</p><p>a clay bodhisattva crossing the river could not even save itself.</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered lightly. A maid from the Prince's Mansion handed him a handkerchief. Xue Fangli wiped his fingers, and Jiang Juan finally reacted. She said after a moment of realization, "…Thank you?"</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>The matter was settled, and the young wolf was accommodated within the Prince's Mansion. However, Jiang Juan still asked Lanting to give the hunter some silver coins so that he could bury the other wolf.</p><p>As the carriage moved farther away from the mansion, the hunter held onto the silver but did not immediately get up. He felt relieved to have escaped unharmed but could not help recalling the face he saw in his panic.</p><p>How beautiful.</p><p>After savoring the memory for a long time, the hunter returned to his stall and was about to pack it up and find a place to bury the wolf when he noticed that his stall, apart from being stained with blood, was completely empty.</p><p>It was quiet inside the carriage.</p><p>Bloodstains also splattered onto the curtain. Not wanting to touch them, Jiang Juan moved slightly inward. No matter how spacious the carriage was, there were only so many seats. Therefore, Jiang Juan leaned closely against Xue Fangli.</p><p>"I…"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to explain when he raised his head and saw Xue Fangli with his eyes closed. Thinking of the weariness in his eyebrows, Jiang Juan fell silent.</p><p>In fact, the moment Jiang Juan made any movement, Xue Fangli had sensed it, but he was too lazy to open his eyes.</p><p>As Jiang Juan approached, Xue Fangli smelled that faint fragrance again. It seemed to be a mix of various herbs, fresh like grass after rain, invigorating and refreshing.</p><p>Though the scent was light and clear, its effect was immense.</p><p>The cacophony in his mind and the restlessness from being unable to sleep all vanished at this moment. Xue Fangli felt peace he hadn't experienced in a long time. He even uncharacteristically lowered all his defenses.</p><p>He allowed the youth to get close, and more importantly, he allowed him—</p><p>The road was uneven, and the carriage jolted suddenly. Jiang Juan hesitated for a few seconds before reaching out to Xue Fangli, making him lean on him so that he wouldn't be awakened and could rest longer on the journey.</p><p>After doing this, Jiang Juan glanced at Xue Fangli again. The man's skin was pale, but his lips were an intense shade of red. As he looked, Jiang Juan couldn't resist touching them.</p><p>Soft.</p><p>The next moment, realizing what he had done, Jiang Juan fell silent.</p><p>He just thought the color looked strangely beautiful.</p><p>Was this considered sexual harassment within marriage?</p><p>Jiang Juan felt guilty and retracted his hand, relieved that Xue Fangli was sleeping deeply and hadn't been woken up. He turned his head to start counting the jade beads on the curtains. Perhaps because he had been awakened twice last night, Jiang Juan fell asleep while counting.</p><p>In the sound of his steady breathing, Xue Fangli slowly opened his eyes. His fingertips brushed over his lower lip and then paused at a spot.</p><p>It was where Jiang Juan had touched earlier.</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli retracted his hand. He sat up again, but the sleeping youth beside him lost support and stuck to him, tilting over onto his shoulder, asleep without any guard.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and looked at him for a few moments, but in the end, he did not push the person away. The faint fragrance in his nostrils seemed to become clearer. Listening to the youth's breathing, Xue Fangli soon felt some drowsiness. This was the first time that without overusing fragrances, Xue Fangli felt sleepy. Just as he was about to close his eyes, the coachman whipped the horsewhip, and someone immediately reported, "Your Highness, we have arrived." "Mm." Xue Fangli pressed his throbbing temple but did not show any intention of getting out of the carriage. The servants in the Wangfu dared not speak much and could only stand quietly to one side. It was Manager Wang, who had been waiting at the palace gate, who walked over and whispered, "What is this? Has something happened?" The servant shook his head without speaking. Jiang Juan vaguely heard voices outside and slowly awakened. He said drowsily, "Your Highness, have we arrived?" As he spoke, Jiang Juan sat up and realized that he had fallen asleep leaning on Xue Fangli's shoulder. Feeling somewhat embarrassed, he said, "The carriage jolted me to sleep. I didn't mean to fall asleep. Why didn't you wake me up?" "I was just about to call you," Xue Fangli's expression remained unchanged, "What does your body smell like?" "Not very fragrant, but tolerable." Jiang Juan was taken aback and lifted his hand aimlessly to smell it, but he could not detect anything. He said uncertainly, "It might be the sachet. Lan Ting gave it to me in the morning, but I didn't like it, so she put it away. It must have picked up some scent." Xue Fangli hummed and stepped out of the carriage. Jiang Juan followed behind. Still not fully awake, he was unsteady on his feet. Seeing this, Manager Wang quickly supported him, and Jiang Juan thanked him, "Thank you." Manager Wang was taken aback and broke into a broad smile, saying, "What kind of words are these from Your Highness? The moment you stepped out, I thought it was as if an immortal had descended to earth. It's my good fortune to be able to help you." Jiang Juan: "..." What is going on with all these people, calling him an immortal and a little bodhisattva? He didn't deserve such praise. "His Majesty dispatched me here early this morning," Manager Wang said with a smile, "Seeing Your Highness must have made His Majesty very happy."</p><p>Jiang Juan listened and quickly turned to ask Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, what should I do next?"</p><p>He was a person who had read books, so he wasn't very familiar with the rules in the palace. Fortunately, Jiang Juan in the book also hadn't seen much of the world, so he said confidently, "I grew up in the countryside and have never been to the city, so I don't know many of the rules."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him carelessly and said, "There are no rules."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He felt that this wasn't right and wanted to continue asking, but then Wu Zongguan spoke up, "Our Majesty doesn't pay attention to these formalities. There's no need for the Duchess to worry."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and recalled the plot.</p><p>In the novel, this emperor appeared infrequently, only three times. The first time was when Duke Ping requested a marriage proposal, the second was when Duke Ping and the protagonist attended Jiang Nian's wedding, and the third was because he became obsessed with longevity techniques and died.</p><p>He was also just a side character.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt relieved, but he thought he might have forgotten something.</p><p>Without time to think, they had already arrived at the palace. Wu Zongguan whispered, "Majesty, the Prince and Princess are here."</p><p>"At last."</p><p>The door opened from inside, and a middle-aged man in dragon robes came out with his shoes on backwards. He smiled but carried an imperial dignity that was like that of an ordinary father teasing his son whom he hadn't seen for a long time. "Wu Zongguan, who is this? I seem to recognize him."</p><p>Wu Zongguan smiled and said, "I also find him familiar, as if... as if..."</p><p>Who it was, he refused to say. The current emperor—Emperor Hongxing glanced at Xue Fangli, "Since you built your mansion, it's harder for me to see you than climbing to heaven. Today, I owe it to Third Young Master."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and said, "Father, there's nothing wrong with not coming frequently to the palace."</p><p>It was merely an excuse, of course Emperor Xinghong knew this and didn't bother to expose it. Instead, he smiled at Jiang Juan and said, "You're called Jiang Juan, right? Come, let me take a look at you."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, showing no signs of nervousness. After examining him for a moment, Emperor Xinghong became increasingly satisfied and nodded repeatedly, "Good boy, a good boy indeed."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong advised kindly, "If you have any grievances in the future, come find me in the palace to make things right. Such a fine child should not suffer any injustices."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, "There's no need to trouble you, Your Highness. Prince Wang can help me."</p><p>"Oh?" Emperor Xinghong was taken aback but then laughed. He gently patted Jiang Juan's shoulder, "That's right, find Fifth Brother. Why come to this old man?"</p><p>"Last night, Sixth Brother was already given a thorough dressing-down by Fifth Brother. As for those impudent dog servants who dared to stir up trouble in front of their master with the heart of a bear and the courage of a leopard."</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Was he disciplined by Prince Wang?</p><p>Jiang Juan opened his eyes wide and looked at Xue Fangli, feeling both delighted and concerned.</p><p>No matter how foolish the Sixth Prince was, he was one of the main characters.</p><p>Was it alright to discipline him?</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze and only said coolly, "He should learn a lesson."</p><p>"Sixth Brother is indeed an incompetent fellow who needs some teaching. I dismiss him," Emperor Xinghong waved him away in disdain. Then he remembered something and continued, "As for your elder brother, you should at least give him some face; don't let him lose his dignity."</p><p>"At the banquet last time, the two of you..."</p><p>Just as he spoke, someone reported from outside the palace, "Your Majesty, Lord Anping requests an audience."</p><p>The hall fell silent for a moment, many pairs of eyes, both overt and covert, landed on Jiang Juan, sizing him up. Even Xue Fangli raised his eyelids.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Duke of Ping An?</p><p>This name sounds somewhat familiar.</p><p>Jiang Juan was momentarily taken aback, thinking hard for a while before an epiphany struck her.</p><p>Isn't this her former fiancé?</p><p>No, it should be her ex-fiancé.</p><p>There was a momentary silence as Jiang Juan recalled what she had forgotten.</p><p>It seemed they had run into each other.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>She remembered that the cannon fodder with the same name as her really adored Duke of Ping An.</p><p>Jiang Juan's scalp tingled as she recalled the plot.</p><p>According to the story, the engagement between Duke of Ping An and Jiang Juan was no secret in the capital; furthermore, wherever Duke of Ping An went after Jiang Juan arrived in the capital, he would be accompanied by her, unable to bear being away from him for a moment.</p><p>Young masters and mistresses from prominent families naturally wouldn't act like her; they cared about their reputations and that of their families, making Jiang Juan stand out as an anomaly.</p><p>It was even better that she only clung to people.</p><p>Duke Ping's Marquis came from an illustrious family, was handsome, and had many admirers. Jiang Juan felt insignificant among them. In terms of family background, talent, and appearance, he had no advantages; the only thing he had was a marriage agreement.</p><p>Jiang Juan was already uneasy, and then discovered that Duke Ping's Marquis had a very unusual attitude towards Jiang Nian. He felt uncomfortable and inquired about the marriage agreement, to which Duke Ping's Marquis replied that it was inconvenient, and kept postponing the wedding date.</p><p>Later on, he realized that Duke Ping's Marquis wanted to break off the engagement. Jiang Juan hardened his heart and first drugged him, then took advantage of his stay at the Ministry of Personnel to climb into bed with him. However, none of these actions went unnoticed.</p>
