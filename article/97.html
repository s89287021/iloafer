						<p>The little bitch Zheng was grooming herself, and you could use your powerful purchasing power to get rid of her. "I'll do it myself," Jiang Juan said, "you've taken care of me all day, today you don't need to take care of me anymore."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Lan Ting was used to living in the side room and taking care of Jiang Juan. She was about to say something when Gao Guashi interrupted, "The concubine has someone else to take care of her, just follow what the concubine says."</p><p>Lan Ting could only give up.</p><p>But she still wasn't entirely at ease, after all, Jiang Juan had some congenital health issues. Lan Ting cautiously said, "Young Master, if you feel uncomfortable, don't force yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, and Lan Ting finally withdrew along with Gao Guashi and the others.</p><p>Lan Ting reminded Jiang Juan that his foot still needed medicine. Jiang Juan carefully unwrapped the gauze; fortunately, the wound wasn't deep and had already healed into a scar.</p><p>Why did I step on shards of glass? Jiang Juan sighed, "I'm so unlucky."</p><p>Jiang Juan solemnly vowed, "There won't be a next time!"</p><p>Not long after, Jiang Juan's medicine arrived. With his pale pink fingertips, he lightly applied the ointment to his foot. Due to pain, Jiang Juan applied it hastily and wouldn't touch it even once extra.</p><p>He worked quickly and finished fast. Just as he was about to put down his foot, his ankle was suddenly seized. Jiang Juan was startled, "Your Highness?"</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly said, "Apply the medicine properly."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him innocently, "I've applied it properly already, I'm done."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and didn't release Jiang Juan's ankle. With his other hand, he touched Jiang Juan's sole with his fingertips to spread the unapplied ointment.</p><p>He exerted very little force, but it was too light. Jiang Juan only felt itchy as his pearl-like rounded toes curled up, a faint pink hue appearing on them.</p><p>The little bitch Zheng was grooming herself, and you could use your powerful purchasing power to get rid of her.

With his pale pink fingertips, he lightly applied the ointment to his foot. The pain made him apply it hastily, and he wouldn't even touch it once extra.</p><p>He worked quickly and finished fast.

With his other hand, he touched Jiang Juan's sole with his fingertips to spread the unapplied ointment.</p><p>He exerted very little force, but it was too light. Jiang Juan only felt a tingling sensation as his pearl-like rounded toes curled up, a faint pink hue appearing on them.</p><p>Jiang Juan lightly inhaled, "Don't..."</p><p>Xue Fangli's movements froze.</p><p>He lifted his eyelids to see Jiang Juan biting her lower lip—she was too itchy; it was unbearable for him to remain still, and his fingers involuntarily clenched the soft cushion beneath the bed, turning slightly white, forming a stark contrast with the dark-colored cushion.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli with moist eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli's hand suddenly lost its lightness as he held Jiang Juan's ankle; Jiang Juan inhaled again, "It hurts."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a moment before finally releasing Jiang Juan's ankle. Jiang Juan seized the opportunity to retract his foot.</p><p>Overwhelmed by itchiness, he turned around, bracing himself like he was facing an enemy: "I'll do it myself this time; I promise to apply it well."</p><p>When Jiang Juan arrived, his hair had only been tied with a single silk ribbon, but now it was all loose. His neck and shoulders were covered in dark black hair, emitting a faint jasmine fragrance that mixed with the medicinal smell.</p><p>Xue Fangli disliked the mingling of various odors, but for some reason, he didn't mind when they came from Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Was your hair dried by a hand warmer?"</p><p>"Yes, letting it air-dry took too long; Lanting was afraid I would catch a chill."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head, truly applying the medicine. After a while, he turned around and extended both hands to Xue Fangli, "It's all medicine."</p><p>Xue Fangli clapped several times, and soon a maid entered with clear water. After washing it off, Jiang Juan thought for a moment and asked Xue Fangli, "Should I call someone in to help?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Hmm?"</p><p>"Here," Jiang Juan pointed to the soft bed with one finger and then stretched his other hand toward the edge of the bed, "all the way to here; it's too far for me to reach. With your poor health, you probably can't even lift me."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>He bent down and directly picked up Jiang Juan into his arms, then walked over.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, hesitating to speak, "You..."</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a faint smile that was neither a laugh nor not, "Even if this king's body is in poor condition, I can still carry you at such a distance."</p><p>He emphasized certain words heavily. Jiang Juan, upon hearing this, couldn't help but reflect on herself; she should have expressed herself more tactfully; it hurt his pride too much. Even if the Prince was truly unable to do so, he should have gritted his teeth and said that he could.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded forcefully and sincerely said, "Yeah, Your Highness can."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>Since Jiang Juan had trouble moving, she naturally crawled onto the inner side of the bed after getting in.</p><p>He barely shared a bed with anyone. After settling down, he felt somewhat awkward and didn't dare to move much. Xue Fangli pulled back the canopy and said indifferently, "Go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent, lying on his side facing away from Xue Fangli. Although he was extremely tired before getting into bed, he found it hard to fall asleep once he got in. Jiang Juan rubbed against his pillow; his untidy hair was pressed under him.</p><p>A hand probed the back of his neck, and Xue Fangli pulled out Jiang Juan's long hair. He idly asked, "Do you have a pet name?"</p><p>"Yes," Jiang Juan replied, "Jiang Lan."</p><p>Afterward, he turned around abruptly and said gloomily, "You're not allowed to laugh. My mom—If my mother had given me the name Jiang Qin when I was born, maybe I would be more active now."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't intend to laugh in the first place, but seeing him like this made him feel a bit amused. He lifted the corner of his lips.</p><p>It wasn't mocking nor his usual cold smile; he simply felt like laughing.</p><p>In fact, Xue Fangli was rather handsome, almost sharp in his beauty. At that moment, his expression softened, truly like clear weather and jade trees.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him and found him quite pleasing to the eye, so she said frankly, "Forget it, if you want to laugh, go ahead."</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan asked him again, "Do you have a style name?"</p><p>Xue Fangli still smiled, but his eyebrows were cold and indifferent as if he was thinking of something. After a long moment, he answered with some disappointment, "No."</p><p>He paused for a bit, then lowered his eyes and said casually, "I'll tell you a story, will you listen?"</p><p>Since he couldn't sleep anyway, Jiang Juan nodded eagerly, full of curiosity about ancient bedtime stories, "Sure."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly. "Once there was a young girl whose first half of life was smooth and peaceful. Her parents doted on her, and her husband's family respected and protected her."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>"Then..."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly. Suddenly, he remembered a very calm night. On that night, the woman did not go mad; she merely sobbed at her desk.</p><p>Her shoulders shook violently as tears soaked all the papers. The woman stammered, "Love and desire are like holding a torch. If you walk against the wind, there will surely be a burning pain in your hand."</p><p>"...there will surely be a burning pain in your hand."</p><p>The hand of Xue Fangli that was resting on Jiang Juan's neck suddenly moved as if it had been scalded.</p><p>Jiang Juan waited for a long time without hearing the continuation. He asked again, "Prince, and then?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids but said nothing, merely staring at Jiang Juan with an expressionless gaze, so calm that it was eerie.</p><p>He left the young man behind just to keep him; it had nothing to do with love or desire.</p><p>And he did not have love or desire; he only had endless hatred.</p><p>After what seemed like a long time, Xue Fangli finally spoke. In a flat tone, he said, "There is no then. You should go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Forget it, if it's just some story about lovesick fools, he might end up tossing and turning all night.</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to comfort himself and turned his head to start dozing off. Soon, he fell into a sweet black sleep.</p><p>Jiang Juan slept until the next morning.</p><p>Not enough sleep caused headaches, but too much sleep wasn't comfortable either. Just as Jiang Juan sat up with his hand on his forehead, Lanting pulled back the curtains.</p><p>"Sir, you're awake."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Jiang Juan realized belatedly that he was alone in bed and asked Lanting, "Where is the Prince?"</p><p>"The Prince had already left by the time I came."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "Oh," and just as Lanting was about to ask if he wanted to have some food, the High Steward heard the noise and knocked on the door. "Your Excellency, the Sixth Prince has arrived and has been waiting for you for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "The Sixth Prince?"</p><p>The High Steward chuckled, "He said he wants to show you something special."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He didn't want to see anything special or become unhappy, but since the person had already arrived, Jiang Juan reluctantly agreed, "Alright."</p><p>The High Steward hurriedly went to fetch someone. By the time Xue Congjun walked in with his chest held high and back straight, Lanting had nearly finished preparing everything for Jiang Juan.</p><p>Upon seeing him, Xue Congjun arrogantly declared, "Hickory Dickory Dock, today I'm going to broaden your horizons."</p><p>The words were barely out of his mouth when he pushed the small box, which he had been holding to his chest, toward Jiang Juan. "Take a look at what's inside."</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously pulled open the lid, and upon taking a quick glance down, nearly fainted.</p><p>——There was a bug squatting at the bottom of the box!</p><p>Jiang Juan had an intense fear of bugs. He had experienced similar pranks when he was young; he had intended to grab a book from under his desk but instead touched a bug.</p><p>Years later, Jiang Juan was once again overwhelmed by this fear. He nearly threw the box away until Xue Congyun caught it in time.</p><p>Xue Congyun shouted, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was also irritated and retorted, "You should be the one asking what I'm doing."</p><p>"I——" Xue Congyun roared at him fiercely, but before he could even finish uttering a single word, his own hands started trembling. "Why… why are you crying?"</p>
