						<p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p><p>Everyone else wōngmeng le.</p><p>Only Xiē Fàlí, who had been expressionless, seemed to realize something upon seeing the scene and came over with an unhappy look, pulling Jiang Juan along.</p><p>He said coldly, "He is this prince's concubine, not Second Young Master."</p><p>Yang Liusheng blurted out, "Then where is Second Young Master?"</p><p>A friend nudged him with his elbow, raised his chin slightly, and whispered, "Second Young Master is over there."</p><p>Yang Liusheng: "?"</p><p>He turned around and saw the very person who had praised Jiang Juan just now. Yang Liusheng wōngmeng le again.</p><p>"Isn't Second Young Master the most beautiful man in the capital?" Yang Liusheng was astonished, "What kind of beauty is he?"</p><p>Even the slowest person should have understood the situation by now; after all, Jiang Nian had always been deep-thinking, and his face twisted for a moment.</p><p>This Yang Liusheng actually thought Jiang Juan was him!</p><p>All those compliments he had given were directed at Jiang Juan, not at himself!</p><p>Having already been humiliated once, this act of Yang Liusheng enraged Jiang Nian even more. However, in front of everyone, he could not show his anger, as he was the gentle and dignified Second Young Master of the Shàngshū Mansion.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his hands and smiled slowly, "I truly——cannot compare to my younger brother."</p><p>With each word, Jiang Nian gritted his teeth and forced himself to say them out. His unwillingness and resentment did not leak in the slightest; he would not allow the image he had carefully maintained to be ruined in an instant.</p><p>Speaking like this, Yang Liusheng echoed, "A person should have self-awareness. Second Young Master knows that he is not truly the most beautiful man as his title suggests. Why do you still give him such a reputation?"</p><p>Yang Liusheng, this person, not only spoke harshly but also possessed an extremely straightforward character. Otherwise, his friends would not keep reminding him, fearing that he would offend Jiang Nian. In the end, no matter how many times they reminded him, he still viciously offended the person.</p><p>His friend pushed him fiercely and whispered, "Say less."</p><p>Once words were spoken, they were like spilled water; no matter how few words he spoke now, what he had already said hung in the air, making the situation extremely awkward.</p><p>Jiang Nian's fingers trembled. He cared deeply, truly caring with his heart, yet he could only smile nonchalantly, "Mr. Yang is right. Jiang Nian has always said that the First Beauty of the Capital, apart from another person, I—have overstated it."</p><p>The Duke of Pingping replied, "Mr. Yang, you praise him as a master painter; how can you be so unable to distinguish between beauty and ugliness?"</p><p>"Physical beauty, seen once or twice, can make one feel like they've encountered a divine being, but after seeing it many times, it's just ordinary. Only inner beauty lasts forever. In this duke's view, Mr. Yang, you are merely an ordinary person infatuated with superficial appearances and unaware that true beauty lies in the soul, not the skin."</p><p>His implication was clear: no matter how beautiful Jiang Juan was, she could not compare to Jiang Nian. Not recognizing Jiang Nian's beauty made one an ordinary person.</p><p>Yang Liusheng pondered for a moment and said, "Your Excellency, I have a word, but I don't know if it is appropriate to speak."</p><p>The Duke of Pingping smiled and said, "Speak."</p><p>Yang Liusheng spoke gently, "Are you perhaps—blind?"</p><p>"How long has it been like this? Have you ever seen a doctor?"</p><p>The Duke of Pingping had belittled his taste as lowbrow, so Yang Liusheng secretly called him blind. Since they were not agreeing on anything, the Duke of Pingping rolled up his sleeves and ignored him. Yang Liusheng then took a moment to observe Jiang Nian.</p><p>She was truly unremarkable.</p><p>If he hadn't met that youth, he might have carefully studied why she was known as the First Beauty of the Capital. But now, having seen Huoyue, how could he care about a firefly?</p><p>Could the light of a firefly ever compete with the brilliance of the moon!</p><p>Yang Liusheng no longer looked at Jiang Nian but instead asked Jiang Juan, "Princess Consort, may I paint a portrait for you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>He just had a nap, and the plot went south.</p><p>Jiang Juan was still in shock when Xue Fangli already gave him an answer: "No."</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then sincerely said, "You draw him; my brother—Second Young Master—he really deserves your talent."</p><p>Yang Liusheng, with a sincere look, said, "Second Young Master is the most beautiful man in the capital, and you are the most beautiful woman in the world. Between the two of you, I would choose to paint you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was purely being kind, trying to pull the plot back on track, but what Jiang Nian heard was entirely different.</p><p>He felt humiliated.</p><p>How could he need his pity!</p><p>Jiang Nian felt a surge of anger and dizziness. He tightly grabbed the armrest of the chair with his already blood-stained hands, leaving more bruises.</p><p>Desperate.</p><p>Extremely desperate.</p><p>He had never been in such a desperate situation before.</p><p>Today's events would soon spread throughout the entire capital, and this good brother of his actually placed him in such a predicament!</p><p>He underestimated him previously!</p><p>Jiang Nian's breathing quickened.</p><p>The awkward atmosphere was not alleviated much. Emperor Xionghsing did not appear, changing the subject, "Yang Liusheng, I summoned you because I heard that you are skilled in restoring ancient paintings. Can you repair a few for me?"</p><p>Yang Liusheng: "Yes, yes, but——"</p><p>Emperor Xionghsing: "But what?"</p><p>Yang Liusheng glanced at Jiang Juan and mentioned again, "Your Majesty, repairing paintings is quite exhausting. Your servant arrived in the capital after a long journey without resting yet, so I might not perform well unless..."</p><p>Jiang Juan had an ominous feeling.</p><p>Sure enough, Yang Liusheng then said, "Unless Princess Consort allows your servant to paint for him, only then will he be motivated."</p><p>Emperor Xionghsing: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>This person was quite unscrupulous. After finishing, Emperor Xionghsing found it rather amusing. He looked at Jiang Juan and asked his opinion, but before Jiang Juan could say anything, Xue Fangli again coldly intervened.</p><p>"No need."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with an unclear expression.</p><p>Jiang Juan was oblivious and tried to pull his hand back, only for it to be suddenly gripped tightly.</p><p>He raised his head in confusion, "Prince?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What good painting is there?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not want Yang Liusheng to paint but had no choice but to ask Yang Liusheng for help, so he shook his head at random, "Prince, quickly let go."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not let go, but rather gripped tighter. He lowered his eyelids and his gaze fell on Jiang Juan's face, the meaning unclear: "The most beautiful woman in the world?"</p><p>He would have been fine if he had not said it; as soon as he mentioned Jiang Juan, she lost her dream, "It's not that I don't love you, stop saying such nonsense."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time, his voice indifferent: "This king does not find you beautiful."</p><p>Whether or not she was beautiful, the main thing was that his hand hurt. Jiang Juan tried to take back her hand, but couldn't, so he said, "Your Highness, please stop squeezing me; it hurts."</p><p>The young man's eyelashes lifted slightly, and his face was fresh and beautiful. As Xue Fangli looked at him, he felt annoyed, and malice surged uncontrollably.</p><p>——Why are there so many people watching?</p><p>If he broke his wings and locked him in a cage, no matter how beautiful she was, it would only be for him to admire alone.</p><p>It's just that...</p><p>He cried too much, and was too difficult to console.</p><p>Mad and dark thoughts rose, then he forcibly suppressed them. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan without expression and finally let go of his hand.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not make a fuss; when he let go, he returned to his original spot and said to Yang Liusheng, "I will paint for you, but you must promise me one thing."</p><p>What is it? Yang Liusheng asked or did not ask, immediately overjoyed: "Alright, just tell me!"</p><p>As long as Jiang Juan agreed to paint, everything was ready. Even the theme, Yang Liusheng had already decided on a painting of "Spring Sleep of the Hibiscus." Yang Liusheng hurriedly responded to Emperor Hongxing's request and, after bowing and leaving, urgently tugged at Jiang Juan, afraid he would change his mind.</p><p>Yang Liusheng: "Lady Wang, how about I paint 'Spring Sleep of the Hibiscus'? You, you——"</p><p>The friend lowered his head, his lips slightly moving, "Don't you value your life? Didn't you see Your Highness's gaze; he hates to kill you alive."</p><p>Yang Liusheng indeed had not paid much attention to others. Hearing this, he raised his head and met Xue Fangli's extremely cold eyes. His heart skipped a beat; what did it mean by saying he hated to kill him alive? Clearly, it meant killing him alive and then cutting him into pieces.</p><p>Terrible, too terrible.</p><p>Yang Liusheng shivered, not daring to continue. "Madame, do as you please."</p><p>Yang Liusheng wrote swiftly, and before long, his task was done. When he raised his head again, a canopy fell down, soft gauze covering the young man's face, making it indiscernible.</p><p>Yang Liusheng: "..."</p><p>Is this Prince actually a prince who avoids intimacy or one consumed by jealousy?</p><p>He doesn't even allow a second glance; how miserly.</p><p>Jiang Juan instinctively raised her head, but before she could see anything clearly, she was pulled up.</p><p>Just as he was about to say something, he unexpectedly met Jiang Nian's gaze from not far away. The hatred in her eyes made Jiang Juan stagger, and she immediately grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve.</p><p>"…Prince."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at the guards, seemingly issuing some orders, before casually lowering his eyes once more. However, Jiang Juan was completely unaware of this.</p><p>The more he saw Jiang Nian's gaze, the more frightened he became. Recalling the storyline from the book about Prince Anping seizing power, Jiang Juan muttered to himself, "Prince, I am going to die."</p><p>"I can't even see you off."</p>
