						<p>According to Jiang Juanliang, Jiang Juàn opened his mouth and could only say that you were right. When he opened his mouth, it was probably to find a fulcrum to move the Earth.</p><p>To deal with know-it-alls, one should either deceive them or argue back more fiercely. Jiang Juàn wanted to reason with him, but now Jiang Juàn had thoroughly changed his mind. He decided to use magic to resist magic.</p><p>Jiang Juàn asked seriously, "Are you a beam in the Spring Depth Pavilion, that... long and horizontal bar?"</p><p>"If you are," Jiang Juàn said, "then you didn't see with your own eyes what happened in the Spring Depth Pavilion, so how could you know that the Prince killed his mother personally and then set fire to her body?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang raised his voice and said, "I just know!"</p><p>Jiang Juàn said slowly, "Really? I don't believe it."</p><p>He spoke politely, but somehow Jiang Qingliang got angry. He said in a bad mood, "It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not; that's the fact. Yu Meiniu was... too good to the Prince for some reason, and the Prince probably hated Yu Meiniu long ago."</p><p>Jiang Juàn thought about it and still said, "Really? I don't believe it."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He asked Jiang Juàn in bewilderment, "What do you want to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juàn looked at him and said as he wished, "You mentioned facts but used the word 'probably,' which means you're not certain either. If even you are uncertain about the matter, can it be called a fact? Don't you feel contradictory?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He stared at Jiang Juàn in disbelief for a long time and then said, "What are you trying to argue anyway?"</p><p>Jiang Juàn said curiously, "You're the one who's arguing, isn't there a logical flaw? I was just being kind and pointing it out."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang asked impatiently, "Do I have to thank you for that?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "If you want to thank me, you can."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He was completely at a loss for words.</p><p>After a long while, Jiang Qingliang said gloomily, "I finally understand why everyone says I deserve a beating. Having someone contradict you every time is really frustrating."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a few seconds and continued to hurt him, "Really? I don't believe it."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He was so angry.</p><p>Taking several deep breaths, Jiang Qingliang, who couldn't bear Jiang Juan's taunting any longer, held back and said to Jiang Juan, "Listen, I'll tell you something secretly. This is something I can confirm is true."</p><p>The words fell, and Jiang Qingliang hesitated about where to start. Suddenly, he caught sight of Jiang Juan's intention to speak and immediately shouted, "I don't care if you believe it or not, shut up and let me speak!"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes and said "oh," although this time he didn't intend to hurt Jiang Qingliang; he had only realized a problem after the fact.</p><p>Today was for the memorial service of Yu Meiniu. The Prince came for his mother's funeral at Miaolin Temple, while the military officers were...</p><p>And judging from Jiang Qingliang's attitude, he seemed to be defending Yu Meiniu.</p><p>What...?</p><p>"For many years, on the night Yu Meiniu left, I saw my father and mother talking," Jiang Qingliang said softly. "My father said... she didn't die in the fire at Chunshen Pavilion. She had already died when the fire started, a dagger pierced her heart, and when the Prince was found—"</p><p>"Holding a dagger covered in blood."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang sneered, "I guess you could say we're distant relatives. So why do I always end up clashing with him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was shocked as he said, "Cousin? But is Yu Mei Ren my wife?"</p><p>Jiang Qing Liang slowly replied, "She is my aunt."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>What situation is this?</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes widened, and suddenly he remembered a day when the Prince told him a story about someone who died without illness.</p><p>—"There once was a daughter, half of her life lived smoothly and safely, with her parents loving and spoiling her, and her in-laws respecting and protecting her."</p><p>Such stories always take an unexpected turn, but the Prince didn't continue at that time. Jiang Juan had a feeling that this was Yu Mei Ren's first half of her life.</p><p>But what about her second half?</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered asking Gao Xing Shi about Yu Mei Ren before. At that time, Gao Xing Shi also told him a story.</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly had a terrifying conjecture.</p><p>Jiang Qing Liang said with a complex expression, "The fire in Chunshen Hall, was it lit by the Prince? And who else could have done it?"</p><p>"For these many years, every time my aunt's memorial service is held, he goes to Miaolin Temple but refuses to worship her. Is this guilt or what?"</p><p>"It doesn't matter, anyway, he must be feeling guilty."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke softly, yet his tone was very certain as he said, "Yu Mei Ren might also have been the one the Prince acted against. The Prince is such a person."</p><p>Jiang Qing Liang stubbornly disagreed with him, "If you say so, it's so?"</p><p>"Alright, if that's what you say, then it is," Jiang Juan said boldly. "I am his Wangfei, sharing the same bed with him every night, no one understands the Wangye better than me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "... "</p><p>He was choked again and took a while to figure out what to say, so he rolled his eyes before lifting his chin, "We're here."</p><p>Jiang Juan had no more patience. He was puzzled by too many things and wanted to ask the Wangye about it, so he shook his head, "I'm going in."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan tried to leave but was stopped again by Jiang Qingliang, "Didn't you just say there's still something with Niege?"</p><p>"Pushing Niege into the lake, what were you thinking?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said curiously, "With your mouth, you talk easily, but actually doing it could kill people. You can accomplish things with your words alone, why do you have to use your hands?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him helplessly and said seriously, "You're right, next time I'll use my mouth instead of my hands."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "... "</p><p>Damn, did he start again!</p><p>He crossed his arms in annoyance and sized up Jiang Juan.</p><p>To be honest, Jiang Qingliang really didn't associate Jiang Juan with the self-conscious and jealous brother described by Niege. That was also the reason why he was shocked after Jiang Juan introduced himself.</p><p>—This is an angel-like person, how could they push someone into a lake?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang couldn't figure it out despite his efforts. Jiang Juan was eager to leave, "I really have to go."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Wait, I'm not done yet here."</p><p>He had more to say, and only then did Jiang Juan realize he was intimidating Jiang Qingliang, "Do you believe I would push you into the lake too?"</p><p>"Only you?" Jiang Qingliang looked at him doubtfully, raising his chin. "Push me if you want. I'll stand here and let you push. If I can get into the lake, I'll call you daddy."</p><p>Such strange requirements, Jiang Juan had never encountered before. It didn't matter what this son wanted; he just wanted to satisfy Jiang Qingliang. Jiang Juan reluctantly pushed him a little, but Jiang Qingliang didn't budge.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang mocked him, "With that strength of yours, you think you can push me down?"</p><p>After a few moments of contemplation, Jiang Juan turned to the guard and said, "Help me throw him into the lake."</p><p>"???" Jiang Qingliang exclaimed.</p><p>The guards obeyed, piling up around him. Although Jiang Qingliang had trained in martial arts since childhood, the palace guards were no pushovers either. Moreover, he was dumbfounded. As a result, Jiang Qingliang was thrown into the lake.</p><p>With a splash, water splashed far and wide as Jiang Qingliang emerged from the surface. He laughed in anger, "Are you still stalling?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't bother with him any further and simply asked slowly, "Can I start shouting now?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang looked green and said, "I told you to push me, not for the guards to do it."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "But you said if I could get into the lake, I should call. You didn't say that only I had to throw you in."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was silent for a moment, wiping water from his face and reaching out to Jiang Juan, "Then pull me first. My clothes are drenched and too heavy; I can't swim."</p><p>Without much thought, Jiang Juan reached out to pull him. Jiang Qingliang smiled triumphantly as he tried to pull Jiang Juan down—</p><p>With a splash, he was kicked back into the water.</p><p>"???" Jiang Qingliang exclaimed again.</p><p>Jiang Juan was also startled and turned around. To his surprise, Xue Fangli had arrived.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, staring at the rippling lake surface with a rather cold demeanor, knowing how long he had been here and what had happened. Jiang Qingliang emerged from the water with a splash, seeing Jiang Juan shout "Your Highness" and was startled. She tried to remain calm as she looked over. Xue Fangli, looking down from above, asked, "If it weren't for this King's presence, would you still have wanted to pull him into the water?" Jiang Qingliang felt aggrieved, "He made the first move, I just wanted to bring him down too." Upon hearing this, Xue Fangli slowly turned to Jiang Juan and asked, "Did you attack him?" His tone was calm, but Jiang Juan showed a hint of satisfaction. Recalling that Jiang Qingliang had mentioned Yumeini as his aunt, he considered Xue Fangli his cousin-in-law, so the King being pleased made sense. Jiang Juan intended to explain but, after a moment's thought, admitted honestly, "I did attack him. I... should..." "You should." Before Jiang Juan could finish, Xue Fangli interrupted calmly. Seeing Jiang Qingliang in the water, he looked at Jiang Juan awkwardly yet curiously. Over the years, although Xue Fangli had grown closer to the military estate, he also faced difficulties there. This King cousin-in-law would likely have to back him up. Just as he was enjoying himself, Jiang Qingliang saw Xue Fangli smile and say, "He trained in martial arts from a young age, has muscular build, tough skin, and isn't afraid of pain; you two are alike." Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and asked Jiang Juan, "Does your hand hurt?" Jiang Qingliang: "? ? ?" He was attacked by someone, yet the King was concerned about his Queen's hand hurting?</p><p>Is there still any sense of justice left?</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, looking somewhat surprised.</p><p>Xue Fangli grabbed his hand. The push Jiang Juan had given him earlier had really made a small patch of his palm red; Xue Fangli rubbed it a few times, raised his eyes, and looked coldly at Jiang Qingliang.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Oh my God, I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p>As it turned out, his intuition was correct.</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a faint smile, "Since you love to stay in the water so much, you also want to drag the princess into the water, like finding something for this lord."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a smile that was neither laughter nor disdain, "Well, are you willing?"</p><p>Even if Jiang Qingliang was willing, he could only say insincerely, "No, I'll go find it right away."</p><p>Just as he was about to dive into the lake, Jiang Juan hurriedly said, "Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang froze in hope, thinking that maybe Jiang Juan had discovered his conscience and would speak up for him. But instead, Jiang Juan said, "Did you forget about that?"</p><p>"If you can go down into the lake, just call out to me!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He is just a helpless and pitiful know-it-all, how could he be so.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was utterly despondent. He moved his lips but found it too painful to utter any words.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, feeling much worse, before saying, "Alright, I knew you couldn't say it. I was just kidding."</p><p>"Letting you talk nonsense every day."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him and said seriously, "In the future, if you say anything bad about the Prince, you'll just take it like this; the Prince will only feel worse than you."</p><p>"... He is really very good, very good."</p>
