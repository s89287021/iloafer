						<p>The despondent Jiang Juan decided to put on a good performance.</p><p>He ignored Xue Fangli for an entire minute, but because he wanted to take an early bath, Jiang Juan couldn't help but hug him and muttered his complaints under his breath.</p><p>"Why haven't you... "</p><p>It felt uncomfortable.</p><p>It was still so rough.</p><p>"Do you really think this king can't do it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his voice hoarse. "You wanted to be comfortable, yet you refused to take action. It's not my fault if the roughness is bothering you."</p><p>Jiang Juan found him irritating and buried his face in his arms, only managing to touch something with his fingertips—a dark silk fabric that was damp. Jiang Juan subconsciously asked, "Why is it wet?"</p><p>Xue Fangli answered indifferently, "You did it. It's not just this one spot."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>"What are you saying? You... I..."</p><p>Jiang Juan nearly bit his tongue and couldn't speak clearly. At that moment, an arm encircled his waist. Jiang Juan reached out, remembering the hand in his memory—it was slender, pale, with clear joints.</p><p>This hand had almost made him cry, causing all sorts of trouble.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>His eyelashes flickered, and he couldn't help but recall some terrible things. Jiang Juan felt a bit embarrassed, continuously using his forehead to gently bump Xue Fangli, his face blushing fiercely.</p><p>He finally calmed down.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>At dawn, Jiang Juan was shaken awake.</p><p>He really was shaken awake. He had been lying in Xue Fangli’s arms, fast asleep, when a hand started shaking him on his back, shattering his dreams and causing the ground to tremble.</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled groggily, “Prince, what are you doing?”</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, “After breakfast, I will go out with you.”</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He said in pain, "Prince, please go by yourself. You need to learn how to be independent. Yesterday, I listened to court documents with you for a long time, and it was really tiring. I don’t want to..."</p><p>Want what? Before Jiang Juan could finish his sentence, he fell asleep again. Xue Fangli glanced at him but did not let up; instead, he called Lan Ting, “Take care of him.”</p><p>Lan Ting replied obediently, “Yes, My Lord.”</p><p>His consciousness was still hazy as he said feebly, “Before, I could sleep whenever and however I wanted. Now that you’ve taken me in your hands, you even won’t let me sleep a little longer. Prince, have you changed your mind?”</p><p>"..."</p><p>Is that considered a good thing?</p><p>Given the lack of business, Jiang Juan naturally continued to dawdle. However, Xue Fangli’s one sentence made this lazy fish turn over.</p><p>Xue Fangli said leisurely, “Since yesterday’s matter wasn’t finished, I will continue teaching you something today, shall we?”</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He quickly sat up and immediately submitted, "Go out, I'll go with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded but sighed softly, "Wasted."</p><p>After breakfast, Jiang Juan was carried into a carriage, and they arrived at a tea house.</p><p>"Why are you drinking tea so early in the morning?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had not slept well and was in a bad mood. Lanting came out with him today, and upon seeing his state, she found it hilarious, "It's because Young Master lacks energy that he should drink some tea to refresh himself."</p><p>What does it matter what tea one drinks or how one refreshes oneself? Wouldn't one have energy after getting enough sleep? Jiang Juan disagreed. He leaned back and continued to question, "Prince? Why are you here?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied coolly, "To see someone."</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked him, "Who?"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, someone was politely led in. Yang Liusheng walked over deliberately, followed by a young boy carrying painting supplies, "Yang Liusheng pays respects to Your Highness and Consort."</p><p>Ah, Yang Liusheng.</p><p>The master painter who only depicted beauty. He had lingered in Baitahuan before, and this time he mistakenly took Jiang Juan for an actor, painting his portrait, which caused the plot to veer off course again.</p><p>However—</p><p>"I promised to repair your old painting and then paint another portrait, but I forgot."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit embarrassed. Yang Liusheng's smile was rather bitter.</p><p>Jiang Juan had forgotten, but he had not. After all, Yang Liusheng only painted beauty; after seeing Jiang Juan, if asked to paint someone else, he found them ordinary and unworthy of his brush.</p><p>Thinking of this, Yang Liusheng glanced at Xue Fangli and forced a smile as he said to Jiang Juan, "It's fine. We'll both paint today. It will only mean that Concubine Zi needs to stay a bit longer."</p><p>Jiang Juan was puzzled, "Ah? Two paintings?"</p><p>Yang Liusheng replied, "Didn't the Prince say so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head, and Xue Fangli then said coldly, "He's helping this Wang find a beggar."</p><p>A few days ago, a storyteller at a tavern told a story about events from the previous dynasty. In fact, this story was related to Jiang Qingmei. Since that day, Xue Fangli had been searching for the beggar who told the story, but he had vanished. However, there were still people with an impression of him.</p><p>Yang Liusheng was renowned as a master painter with unparalleled skills, especially in painting portraits. Today, he came to draw this beggar based on the Prince's description. However, he wanted to paint Jiang Juan instead.</p><p>When Wang heard about the beggar, Jiang Juan knew it was related to the tavern incident. Though not informed beforehand, he generously said, "Alright then."</p><p>Seeing this, Yang Liusheng quickly laid out the paper, fearing that the Prince might change his mind and stop him from painting Concubine Zi.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat in Xue Fangli's arms and soon began to feel sleepy.</p><p>Usually, appearing tired would make one seem less spirited. However, Jiang Juan was different. His expression was dull as if he were a wilted hawthorn petal, thin and soft, beautiful yet heart-wrenching and pitiable.</p><p>With his injured eyes bandaged in white silk, the breeze made the fabric flutter, highlighting his almost translucent skin, pure like transparent glass.</p><p>Yang Liusheng raised his head and nearly forgot to continue painting.</p><p>His pale fingers tapped lightly on the table. The sound was faint, but Yang Liusheng looked up immediately. Upon seeing this, he shivered involuntarily—</p><p>The Prince was looking at him coldly, with a dangerous expression that made it seem as if staring for another second would cause his eyes to be gouged out!</p><p>Yang Liusheng hastily lowered his head, pretending to be sketching.</p><p>Was it just because he glanced at Empress Consort Zi a few times?</p><p>Isn't the Empress Consort too petty!?</p><p>He was muttering incessantly when Lanting suddenly said, "Eh, isn't that Young Master Gu over there?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did hear it, but since it had nothing to do with him, he was almost asleep. Then he was awakened by someone pinching his cheeks, and Jiang Juan really couldn't bear it anymore. "What are you doing."</p><p>"Prince, I want to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli said calmly, "If you're tired, drink some tea."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head repeatedly. Seeing that he seemed a bit angry, Lanting helplessly said, "Young Master, don't always sleep; the more you sleep, the less energetic you become."</p><p>Forget about the Prince, even Lanting was on Jiang Juan's side. Jiang Juan said gloomily, "I just like sleeping and want to sleep for longer."</p><p>While he said that, Lanting couldn't stop thinking about what Master Anan had said. She guessed that the Empress Consort must have remembered it.</p><p>After all, whenever Jiang Juan wanted to sleep in the past, the Empress Consort always let him do as he wished. But ever since that day, the Empress Consort seemed unwilling to let Jiang Juan sleep for too long.</p><p>It was just that—</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't know that Xue Fangli had heard what she said on that day, and Lanting didn't dare say anything more to him either. She could only silently watch as Xue Fangli picked up the teacup and coaxed Jiang Juan to drink a few sips of tea. After a while, she finally sighed without a word.</p><p>His spirit was unsteady.</p><p>Why would it be unsteady?</p><p>Young Master, please don't have any more accidents.</p><p>The carriage stopped before the pavilion.</p><p>Jiang Nian and his maid Dian Cui entered Lǎnyuèlóu.</p><p>It was still early, and there were few people inside. Jiang Nian glanced around and stepped onto the stairs, with Dian Cui following closely behind him. She whispered softly, "Young Master, you've been rather gloomy these past few days. Seeing His Highness the Sixth Prince today should cheer you up a bit."</p><p>Jiang Nian had indeed been in a foul mood lately.</p><p>The reason was none other than Lord Anping Jiang Juan.</p><p>It had been some time since he heard that Lord Anping was insane, and although he found it humiliating, he still visited him frequently. However, Lord Anping always looked dispirited, as if on the brink of total collapse, which made Jiang Nian extremely angry.</p><p>But no matter how angry he was, Emperor Hongxing had already arranged for their marriage, binding them like two insects on a thread. Jiang Nian could only console himself that Lord Anping would eventually become emperor and that with more patience, things would improve.</p><p>As for Jiang Juan, Jiang Nian almost went mad because of him!</p><p>Firstly, Li Wang became the crown prince, and Jiang Juan was elevated to the status of crown princess.</p><p>Then, his younger brother's grandfather turned out to be none other than the infamous White Snow Dynasty's Empress Shue!</p><p>Jiang Nian should have been worried about Crown Prince Xue Chaohua not taking over governance. This was the second major change after Li Wang's death following his rebirth. After learning of Jiang Juan becoming crown princess and discovering that his grandfather was a remarkable figure, Jiang Nian was consumed by jealousy. He tossed and turned in bed at night, repeatedly telling himself to calm down—</p><p>When summer arrived and the rain came, everything would be alright.</p><p>What difference did it make if his brother became crown princess? What mattered if his grandfather was Empress Shue?</p><p>In life, the crown prince suffered a tragic fate due to that rainstorm, and Li Wang would only meet the same end!</p><p>Unless...</p><p>He could find Xie Baolu to control the water.</p><p>But how can this be?</p><p>As for Xie Baifu, Jiang Nian would personally go to see him after the rain.</p><p>Only by experiencing disaster and then being rescued will people feel grateful towards him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jiang Nian calmed his heart. No matter what, Dian Cui was right; even if Prince Anping was depressed lately, seeing Xue Congjun a few times would make him feel better.</p><p>After all, he had spent so many years with them, entertaining and making these few people—Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang—happy. It was now time for him to be rewarded.</p><p>Today they had made an appointment with himself, and Jiang Nian roughly guessed the reason.</p><p>In a few days, it would be his birthday.</p><p>Regardless of Gu Puwang, Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang were extremely kind towards him.</p><p>Walking down the stairs, the table by the window was already occupied. Jiang Nian walked over, smiled gently, "Why so early?"</p><p>After a pause, Jiang Nian said with a smile, "Let me guess, you came to see me today to... discuss how I should celebrate my birthday?"</p><p>"Last year I told you not to bother," Jiang Nian did not notice Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang's strange expressions and continued, "This year, why don't we come to our residence? Let's all gather for a good reunion, how about it?"</p><p>Xue Congjun muttered his name softly. Jiang Nian looked at him, "Hmm? What's wrong?"</p><p>When asked what was wrong, Xue Congjun did not speak again. Jiang Nian did not pay much attention and said with a chuckle, "And you. Don't spend too much money anymore, giving me treasures every year is excessive. You even made boasts at the beginning of the year about sending something rare, but you should just do your best within your means."</p><p>Jiang Nian's words seemed to be scolding Xue Congjun, but in fact, he was subtly challenging him without showing any change in expression.</p><p>In the past, as soon as Xue Congjun heard this, he would invariably call out. Today, however, he was unusually calm and composed. It took him a long time before he finally managed to say with great difficulty, "Brother Nian, it’s not because of my birthday... it’s..."</p><p>Xue Congjun opened his mouth, unsure of what to say. He scratched his head and looked at Gu Puwang; for a moment, the atmosphere became almost stagnant.</p><p>If Xue Congjun hadn’t been so hesitant, Jiang Nian might not have noticed anything amiss. But with Xue Congjun acting strangely and Jiang Qingliang, who usually talked the most, remaining silent throughout, Jiang Nian finally realized something was off. However, he didn’t think too much about it and simply asked, "What is it?"</p><p>"I want to ask you a question."</p><p>Gu Puwang slowly spoke up, "Brother Nian, five years ago on Luofeng Mountain, did you really save me?"</p>
