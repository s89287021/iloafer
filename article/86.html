						<p>Jiang Juan: ?</p><p>The Prince actually found it annoying.</p><p>Who woke him up?</p><p>While Jiang Juan still thought that Xue Fangli was the one to blame, he felt she was shifting the blame onto him.</p><p>Since the memorial had been left behind, the Prince no longer served a purpose for Jiang Juan, so he ignored him and started listening idly to what they were saying. However, it was just too boring; no matter how long he listened, Jiang Juan's mind would start wandering.</p><p>That day, almost half a day, Jiang Juan was forced to sit in the study and listen.</p><p>As dusk fell, the last memorial was finally dealt with properly. Gu Yunzhi, unwilling to stay any longer, bid farewell to Xue Fangli, who replied, "Wait."</p><p>"Take another look at the memorial for Yangzhou."</p><p>He meant they needed to discuss it again.</p><p>The Yangzhou memorial concerned a significant matter. Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan perked up, having been lazily leaning against Xue Fangli all day, his bones feeling weak and sore, so he decided to move around a bit. Seeing this, Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Talking about this makes you seem energetic."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke with righteousness, "This is what I wanted to hear, of course, I'm energized."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, grabbed Jiang Juan's hand, and held it between his fingers before saying, "The terrain and climate in the south are naturally prone to flooding. Any mistakes were simply due to good luck."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi: "Your Highness, do you mean...?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Allocate funds for management."</p><p>Properly managing the situation was not impossible; after all, there were indeed many hidden dangers in the southern regions. However, the problem lay in how to manage it and who should be sent to handle it. Gu Yunzhi sighed, "There is a Chang Jiushan, but since he resigned from his post, talent for water management in the court is scarce, making it difficult to find someone for this task."</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone remained calm: "If there are no suitable people in the court, we can issue a public recruitment notice and appoint whoever is capable."</p><p>This was a stroke of luck. Not long ago, I met someone who seemed capable.</p><p>"He is proficient in hydraulic engineering and enjoys doing practical things that can prevent floods. Even my..." </p><p>Jiang Juan said seriously while making up a story, "Even my grandfather praised him as a genius at flood control, but he failed the imperial examinations and could never become an official, so he was of no use."</p><p>Laying Bai Xuechao was purely because Jiang Juan knew how influential his grandfather was. If she said this person was useful, Gu Xunzhi might not believe her, but if her grandfather said it, Gu Xunzhi would feel much more reassured.</p><p>Sure enough, when Gu Xunzhi heard that even Bai Xuechao praised the person highly, he became interested immediately and inquired eagerly, "Who is this person? His hydraulic skills are so impressive that Mr. Bai favors him."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "Xie Baifu. He is a stableman at the imperial stables named Xie Baifu."</p><p>"Xie Baifu..."</p><p>Gu Xunzhi repeated the name several times, "Tomorrow, I will go to the imperial stables with someone else to look for him."</p><p>If this person proved useful, the southern regions would likely be peaceful for a while.</p><p>In the novel, Gu Xunzhi was already a genius at flood control. Gu Xunzhi going personally to find him must have been to confirm his abilities further, but Jiang Juan did not worry about it. She only said, "Prime Minister Gu, if he is useful, he might be unwilling to go south..."</p><p>Gu Xunzhi was taken aback for a moment before smiling, "Alright, I will go check on it tomorrow."</p><p>With everything prepared except for Xie Baifu, Jiang Juan breathed a sigh of relief. Gu Xunzhi then took his leave.</p><p>Outside, the sky was already dark.</p><p>"I thought Your Highness would need some training, but... it turns out you have quite an idea and foresight."</p><p>Gu Xunzhi smiled. Today, assisting from the side, he had expected this young prince to be slow in handling official matters for the first time, but it turned out that whether it was choosing people or making decisions, he acted with considerable skill.</p><p>Sophie Yue was not at all surprised. "Ah, it's only a matter of will, not inability."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi agreed and said, "The Empress Dowager is the same."</p><p>"Heart pure and kind, concerned about the people's livelihood; she is so virtuous that she must be a great help to the palace in the future."</p><p>The virtuous Empress Dowager was now feeling quite guilty.</p><p>She had deceived Gu Yunzhi but couldn't fool Xue Fangli. After all, when they saw Xie Baitu that day, Xue Fangli was also present.</p><p>As the light faded, the study fell silent, and Jiang Juan waited for a while before she heard Xue Fangli ask her something. She had to break the silence herself, "Your Highness, why don't you ask me?"</p><p>"What's there to ask?" Xue Fangli replied indifferently.</p><p>Thinking he was going to ask her questions, Jiang Juan felt quite anxious. Now that he didn't, she was a bit unwilling. "What's wrong with you? Don't you have any curiosity at all?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "I am not you."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli lifted the curtain and said, "Every day I don't understand what you're thinking, no matter how much I try to figure it out, I can't get to the bottom of it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn.</p><p>"Besides," Xue Fangli asked, "even if I ask you, will you tell me the truth?"</p><p>Of course not. Jiang Juan fell silent and abruptly changed the topic. "Your Highness, are you going to be this busy every day in the future?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at her for a moment and said, "Not necessarily."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied with an "oh" and was still sitting in Xue Fangli's arms, feeling truly tired. She took back her hands and tried to stand up, but before she could fully get up, she was suddenly pulled back by someone hugging her waist.</p><p>"Your Highness, what are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't see the momentary hesitation and was startled. Fortunately, it ended with Xiao (unknown character) being pulled into his embrace and sitting on Your Highness's lap instead of falling.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked slowly, "Do you still remember what you promised this king before coming here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, "Ah? What did I promise?"</p><p>Xue Fangli grabbed Xiao's chin, "This king said... I would teach you some new and exciting ways tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "What kind of new and exciting ways?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his lips, "Didn't you ask what to play?"</p><p>When she agreed, Jiang Juan had only been thinking about clearing herself up. Now hearing Xiao ask like this made her think.</p><p>"Play with me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked softly. Xiao didn't mind being intimate with the king and even enjoyed it, as long as he didn't rub her waist too hard. Jiang Juan then said to him, "Alright, you play with me. But be gentle; although I won't break, I really don't like pain."</p><p>Xiao answered frankly, but his frankness was too much, and his expression was so tempting that it made people want to pinch him.</p><p>His Adam's apple moved slightly, Xue Fangli murmured "Hmm," and Xiao carelessly ordered, "Go away."</p><p>All the servants in the study retreated completely. Jiang Juan climbed onto Xue Fangli's neck, tilting her head back to wait for Xiao to kiss her.</p><p>Xiao had already been fondling Shao (unknown character)'s soft and moist lips for a long time. At this moment, the rosy hue on his fingertips faded into a pale color. Compared to this color, Xiao preferred to see Shao's face glowing like a rose.</p><p>They could tease each other like this, they could kiss each other like this, or they could...</p><p>bully each other like this.</p><p>This kiss was initially tender, and Jiang Juan could barely keep her heart calm. She asked resentfully, "Your Highness, do I have cat hair in my mouth?"</p><p>Later on, the scorching breaths intertwined, and Jiang Juan's nape was held down as lips and tongues repeatedly invaded her. She almost melted into the man's embrace, only able to let out a weak moan.</p><p>Jiang Juan really did have her wits about her. After being kissed senseless once, it happened again. In her daze, her belt was undone, and her legs were pinched.</p><p>These slender yet well-proportioned legs had just enough soft flesh, feeling as soft as snow under touch.</p><p>The hand applied pressure, fingers sinking slightly. Jiang Juan didn't know what she was being kissed for; all she could do was breathe heavily — the previous night was similar. She had been kissed in various ways, enjoying all the benefits, but she never learned her lesson.</p><p>Just when that hand started to become unruly...</p><p>Jiang Juan let out an "ah," her consciousness clamping down on that hand. She turned her head slightly, barely regaining some clarity and not wanting any more kisses, but Xue Fangli wouldn't give up on her and leaned in to kiss her again.</p><p>"I don't..."</p><p>Even the most obtuse prey would realize danger at this point, but it was too late. Xue Fangli bit Jiang Juan lightly as a form of punishment, while his free hand tightly pressed her head against her nape, forcing her to endure this invasive kiss.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan was kissed into oblivion, and that restrained hand found freedom, starting to wreak havoc on her body.</p><p>...</p><p>It's unclear how much time passed. Xue Fangli lowered his head with a husky voice, "Do you like this game?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head slowly. Her hair, wet and silky, clung to her neck, and her lashes were damp. She said tearfully, "... I don't like it."</p><p>"You've been kissed for so long, why can't your mouth soften up?"</p><p>Xue Fangli wiped his hands leisurely, "Why are you sitting so far away?"</p><p>Jiang Juan almost sat on Xue Fangli's lap. He reached out to pull her back, but she kept shaking her head frantically and pushed him away, saying, "I don't want to sit back, you, you..."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"...Ouch."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained, "Was it just an accidental touch earlier?"</p><p>Sch Fanli replied, "Don't you want to be the Empress Consort?"</p><p>"…" His voice drifted lazily, "This Wang is just teaching you how to be the Empress Consort—now a Consort Princess."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't want to engage and moved further away, unwilling to back up. Sch Fanli leaned over and embraced her, his chin resting on Jiang Juan's shoulder, inhaling the faint herbal fragrance emanating from her. He spoke slowly, "There's still a long way to go."</p><p>"I'll teach you some more interesting games tomorrow."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What games? I won't play any more games with His Highness.</p><p>From now on, only kissing is allowed!</p><p>Having learned a lesson, Jiang Juan was no longer fooled and complained, "What do you mean by 'more interesting'? You just want to bully me; don't even think about deceiving me again."</p><p>Sch Fanli didn't seem to mind and merely said lazily, "Once is enough, stop pinching this Wang's hand anymore. You can't pinch properly anyway, it's unnecessary."</p><p>"Just a kiss and you turn into a puddle of water."</p><p>His tone seemed regretful, but his expression was utterly satisfied, "Sleep well."</p>
