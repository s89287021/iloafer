						<p>What did his fifth brother hate the most?</p><p>Xue Congjun was taken aback for a moment, then he slowly realized that in his moment of arrogance, he had offended his fifth brother.</p><p>Rules.</p><p>His fifth brother, according to the Empress Dowager, was an unruly bastard who broke all rules.</p><p>"Five Brother, I forgot," Xue Congjun moved his lips, scared out of his wits. He hurriedly explained, "And isn't this marriage something that Fifth Brother is also unhappy about? I just... just..."</p><p>Xue Falisi asked him, "That's my matter, what does it have to do with you?"</p><p>Xue Congjun stammered, "I... I..."</p><p>Xue Congjun was terrified of his brother's smirking face. Zhang Gonggong wasn't much better off. He hadn't expected that his flattery would backfire and immediately knelt down, trying to appease him, "My Lord, you are so magnanimous, surely you won't take it to heart—"</p><p>Xue Falisi laughed, and Zhang Gonggong's body stiffened. He immediately slapped himself, "Forgive me, My Lord! It was my fault for talking too much! It was my fault!"</p><p>"Slap, slap, slap—"</p><p>The sound of slapping never ceased. Zhang Gonggong struck very hard, not daring to hold back at all. His face burned with pain, and his head throbbed, but he couldn't stop his hands.</p><p>"Magnanimous?" Xue Falisi said calmly, "Did you get it wrong, Grandee? I always take revenge without mercy."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Gonggong felt as if ice had run down his spine. He hurriedly crawled towards Xue Falisi on all fours, sobbing and pleading, "Forgive me, My Lord! Forgive me—ah!"</p><p>Xue Falisi kicked him away, and Zhang Gonggong's voice changed pitch. Xue Falisi spoke coolly, "Bring this dog slave here, cut out his tongue, sew up his mouth, and hang him from the beam."</p><p>The guards obeyed the order and rushed forward to apprehend him. Zhang Gonggong kept retreating but to no avail. His shoulder was pressed down, and Zhang's face was filled with fear as he spoke without reserve, "My Lord, it was the Emperor who sent me! The Emperor! What will the Emperor think if I don't return?"</p><p>Xue Falisi remained unmoved, looking down at him condescendingly, muttering, "Truly pitiful."</p><p>"A mere slave," Xue Fangli said, "What would the emperor think? I was merely teaching you etiquette."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Gongong was surrounded by a group of people. Sword lights flashed before his face, and his legs gave out. His face turned pale as ashes.</p><p>He was done for.</p><p>Xue Congjun was stunned, and it seemed Xue Fangli only remembered him then. With slight regret, he said, "Brother Six is an esteemed guest, and you haven't even had a sip of tea. This is my fault in hospitality."</p><p>Xue Congjun was as nervous as a cricket, hurriedly waving his hands to indicate he didn't need it. He wasn't thinking about drinking tea; he just wanted to make a run for it.</p><p>"Serve Brother Six some tea," Xue Fangli ignored him, "I remember you saying that the empress dowager dressed simply and was unlucky."</p><p>Xue Congjun tried to defend himself, "That was…"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, "Did I hear wrong?"</p><p>With a stiff neck, Xue Congjun honestly replied, "N-no."</p><p>A maid came forward with tea. Xue Fangli smiled again, "Why is Brother Six so nervous? Sit down and drink your tea."</p><p>Xue Congjun stared at the tea, feeling his scalp tingle.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhang Gongong had already been hung upside down from the beam above, directly opposite the seat next to the teacup. His face was covered in blood, his appearance horrifying. He was still struggling in pain, and blood kept dripping onto the cup.</p><p>The blood spread out, a deep crimson red.</p><p>Xue Congjun didn't dare provoke Xue Fangli anymore. He stiffly sat down, completely unwilling to touch that cup of tea.</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly asked him, "Why isn't Brother Six drinking tea? Don't you like it?"</p><p>Under his gaze, Xue Congjun had to force himself to swallow the tea despite his nausea, then he squeezed out a smile more painful than crying, "I drank it, Fifth Brother. I like it; I finished it all."</p><p>Xue Fangli heard the words and nodded in satisfaction. He stared at the bloodstains scattered on the ground and asked Xue Congyun, "Sixth Brother, are you still unlucky?"</p><p>Xue Congyun shook his head wildly, "Not unlucky, not at all!"</p><p>"That's good," Xue Fangli glanced at him and gave an order to leave, "It's getting late. Sixth Brother, it's time for you to go home."</p><p>Xue Congyun was overjoyed and jumped up immediately, "I'll leave right away!"</p><p>But before he could take a few steps, he was called back, "Wait a moment."</p><p>Xue Congyun's heart skipped a beat as he turned slowly, "F-Fifth Brother?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "The Emperor sent you to attend the ceremony. Didn't Sixth Brother bring any gifts?"</p><p>Xue Congyun: "... "</p><p>Of course, he didn't bring anything. However, before leaving the palace, Xue Congyun finally managed to persuade his father, the Emperor, to give him a long-desired conch parrot—a statue of a bird placed inside a conch shell that, over time, would develop a lustrous and jeweled appearance.</p><p>But now...</p><p>"Prepare," Xue Congyun couldn't say that he came empty-handed. With tears in his eyes, he reluctantly took out the conch parrot, which he hadn't even warmed up yet, "This—I managed to get it from the Emperor with great difficulty."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't even glance at it, "Sixth Brother has made an effort."</p><p>Xue Congyun felt heartbroken but had to force a smile, "I'm glad Fifth Brother likes it."</p><p>As he said this, Xue Congyun suddenly remembered something, "Oh right, Fifth Brother, since the wedding is settled, don't forget to visit the palace and see the Emperor tomorrow."</p><p>Xue Fangli nonchalantly replied with an "Ah."</p><p>Xue Congyun came with a brisk walk when he arrived, but as he was about to leave, not only did he receive a beating, his treasure was also taken away. He walked out dejectedly, and before taking a few steps, he heard someone from the Wangfu asking, "Your Highness, what are we supposed to do with these boxes...?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, beneath his weary expression lay a chilling coldness, "Drag them away."</p><p>His attitude towards rewards was no secret to He Geshi, who was about to call for someone when Xue Fangli changed his mind. With a thoughtful look, he said, "Since these are gifts, take them to Third Young Master."</p><p>"Tiān Xiān," Xue Fangli recalled Xue Congyun's description of Jiang Juan's appearance, that face truly did not belong in the mortal world, as if he had no desires or ambitions. With interest, he remarked, "This king wants to see if he truly does not belong in the mortal world."</p><p>He Geshi took note of his instructions. Initially, he thought the Young Master had a favorable attitude towards this Third Young Master, but now it seemed that the Third Young Master only happened to pique their Young Master's interest.</p><p>The last person who caught their interest was long buried under tall grass.</p><p>He Geshi shook his head.</p><p>Xue Fangli threw another small object over, "Send this conch bird along too."</p><p>No matter how rare items were when they came out of the palace, He Geshi had lost all interest. Upon receiving it, he began to busy himself with preparations. Xue Congyun could no longer bear to listen and felt his heart breaking.</p><p>To give those uncouth villagers.</p><p>Even Father Emperor's gifts along with his conch bird were given to those uncouth villagers.</p><p>How bitter he was.</p><p>Xue Congyun hurriedly left the Wangfu, becoming more and more distressed and feeling increasingly unjustified. Scratching his head, Xue Congyun decided to wait for Jiang Juan tomorrow.</p><p>Of course, having just been severely beaten, Xue Congyun wasn't very daring in what he planned. His intentions were quite humble.</p><p>—to see his conch bird one last time.</p><p>If he could touch it again, that would be even better.</p><p>Wuwuwu.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken back to his room.</p><p>The palace was vast, and Jiang Juan followed the servant's twists and turns through corridors and past a pond until he arrived at his destination. He was disoriented and could hardly remember how he got there.</p><p>The servant pushed open the door, and someone rushed in anxiously, asking Jiang Juan with great concern, "Young Master, are you alright?"</p><p>Her voice sounded familiar, and Jiang Juan looked around for a moment before recognizing her as the maid who had pleaded for mercy when he first woke up. Jiang Juan thought for a while and concluded that this maid must be Lanting. In the book, when Jiang Juan and his grandfather were still living in the countryside, Lanting had been by his side.</p><p>The servant brought him to the room and closed the door behind them. Jiang Juan shook his head in response: "I'm fine."</p><p>But Lanting still looked distressed. "When has Young Master ever endured such humiliation?"</p><p>Hearing this, Lanting's expression became even more somber. "Even when it came to providing extra servants for Young Master, the Lord was unwilling."</p><p>While newlyweds might not receive dowries, a man would usually have at least a few of his own people around him. However, Secretary Jiang had spared even that. He had only asked Lanting to bring over Jiang Juan's clothes. More accurately, it seemed like he was getting rid of a burden rather than celebrating a wedding.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't quite understand these customs. Just as he was full of confusion, he asked Lanting, "Do you know what kind of person Duke Li is?"</p><p>Lanting had come from the countryside with him and therefore didn't have much knowledge about Duke Li, but she had heard some things. She whispered, "The servant heard that... His Excellency is cruel and merciless, having killed many people without cause."</p><p>This matched the description in the novel, but Jiang Juan was still perplexed.</p><p>Today, Duke Li's attitude had been very kind. Not only did he consider Jiang Juan's needs, but he even believed in him when he was being questioned. It was completely—</p><p>Jiang Juan: "But I think he's a good person."</p><p>Lanting gasped. Jiang Juan couldn't help but speculate, "Given how terrible they say he is, could it be that it's all a rumor?"</p><p>Lanting had no idea and replied uncertainly, "Maybe?"</p><p>Perhaps he had been the victim of malicious gossip?</p><p>Outside the door, the high-ranking official, who was about to knock, was taken aback.</p><p>A good man?</p><p>Their Prince?</p><p>High-ranking official: "?"</p><p>His expression showed a hint of fissure.</p><p>After a long pause, the high-ranking official knocked on the door with mixed feelings. Lan Ting hurriedly opened it, and the official said respectfully, "Your Highness, the Princess, His Highness ordered me to bring several boxes of gifts for you. You may take whatever you like."</p><p>After speaking, he presented the gift list, saying, "You can check each item according to this list."</p><p>Jiang Juansui looked down at the gift list, which was densely written. He could barely make out a few lines.</p><p>Emerald lotus.</p><p>Turquoise brocade carp.</p><p>Coral green feathered bird.</p><p>Jade lotus pendant.</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Juansui: "?"</p><p>Looking at the name, it belonged to a museum's prized collection item.</p><p>He then looked at the box; perhaps the latch had been jolted open during transportation, allowing a faintly visible emerald green that was intensely vivid. Jiang Juan almost felt pricked in the eyes by this imperial green hue.</p><p>It was too valuable for him to keep; he hurriedly shook his head, "I don't need it, I don't need anything like this. Please take it back."</p><p>Gao Guanshi glanced at him a few times and said with a bitter smile, "My lady, do not make things difficult for your servant. The items sent by the prince cannot be returned to him by his servant without incurring punishment."</p><p>It seemed impolite to send it back directly; Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment before saying, "Then leave it here for now."</p><p>Gao Guanshi nodded and added, "The prince has been coughing severely at night. I am afraid my lady might not sleep well, so he has rested in another room. Tonight... my lady does not need to wait for the prince to return to his room."</p><p>Jiang Juan was not surprised at all.</p><p>In the novel, it was the same. In the protagonist's memories, he and Li Wang had slept in separate rooms on their wedding night as well.</p><p>"Oh yes, the prince asked me to convey a message," Gao Guanshi said, "From tomorrow morning onwards, my lady needs to accompany the prince into the palace to meet the emperor."</p><p>"Alright, I understand."</p><p>After finishing his instructions, Gao Guanshi did not linger and bowed before leaving. Jiang Juan continued reading the list of gifts, growing more shocked with each word, feeling that his suspicions were becoming more accurate.</p><p>Li Wang was indeed a great person.</p><p>He had helped him so much and even given him such valuable items.</p><p>However, according to the plot, Li Wang would die tomorrow night.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Juan could no longer bear to read the list of gifts.</p><p>He remembered that Li Wang had died from an acute illness. Even if the imperial doctors arrived in time, they were unable to save him.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and suddenly felt a bit of reluctance.</p><p>But he could do nothing to help.</p><p>Jiang Juan made up his mind.</p><p>From now on, every anniversary, he would burn several stacks of paper for Xue Fangli, making him the richest ghost king in the entire underworld.</p>
