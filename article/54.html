						<p>Xue Fali wants to rest, so Jiang Juan stayed with him for a few days.</p><p>Of course, saying he was accompanying the prince, Jiang Juan was also very happy to relax. Every day without anything to do, he would lie on the bed until tired and then move to the couch to turn over a few times. Once he felt refreshed, he would crawl back beside the prince, pull him into his arms, and start a new round of sleeping together.</p><p>In a sense, Jiang Juan had already enjoyed a carefree life like a floundering fish—</p><p>That evening, Xue Fali patted him gently and said, "Get up."</p><p>Jiang Juan had lain for three days, and his little time-wasting toys were scattered all over the bed. He turned the Lu Ban lock in his hand, lowered his head, and asked, "What's going on?"</p><p>"Go to the Princess's mansion."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his head blankly, "Which Princess's mansion?"</p><p>Xue Fali spoke calmly, "The invitation you received."</p><p>After a few seconds of thought, Jiang Juan finally remembered that he had indeed received such an invitation.</p><p>Oh well, time to get back to work. Jiang Juan sighed deeply and glanced at Xue Fali with a wistful look.</p><p>—Once I've finished taking care of the prince, will I be able to stop working?</p><p>Xue Fali seemed to sense something and looked over, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hurriedly shook his head. He had been so tired at that moment that he hadn't read the invitation carefully. He asked Xue Fali, "Your Highness, which Princess?"</p><p>Xue Fali: "The Eldest Princess."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p><p>It's not surprising that he had such a strong reaction. Jiang Juan acted this way purely because of the extraordinary status of Princess Chang and her husband.</p><p>"Reborn as a Team Pet" is an extremely popular romance novel, but even in such novels, there needs to be antagonists for balance. In this novel, apart from the cannon fodder who perished without much ado at the beginning, the emperor's consort and Princess Chang were important antagonists.</p><p>Duke of Pingyuan lost his parents early on, and the emperor's consort and Princess Chang took him in, personally raising him out of pity for his young age and loss. To Duke of Pingyuan, the emperor's consort and Princess Chang who raised him were like his parents. He held them in high regard and valued them.</p><p>However, when it came to Duke of Pingyuan's marriage, the emperor's consort favored Jiang Juan over Jiang Nian. At the beginning of the story, Princess Chang and her husband left the capital, so they were unaware that Duke of Pingyuan took the opportunity to call off his engagement and requested Emperor Hongxing to arrange a marriage for him.</p><p>According to the plot, after returning to the capital, Princess Chang and her husband held a banquet. Knowing they could no longer hide it, Duke of Pingyuan informed them about canceling the engagement. Princess Chang leaped up in shock, while the emperor's consort flew into a rage. He not only severely reprimanded Duke of Pingyuan but also made things difficult for Jiang Juan.</p><p>Just thinking about the plot made Jiang Juan afraid, fearing they would hold a grudge against him. Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, can I stay home?"</p><p>"The invitation has already been accepted. You'll go and come back."</p><p>"……Alright."</p><p>He reluctantly accepted the invitation since it was Jiang Juan who had taken it. Moreover, the eunuch mentioned that Princess Chang wanted to divorce her concubine, which Jiang Juan agreed to at the time. He could only say, "Then let's hurry and get it over with."</p><p>As long as he ran fast enough, the plot couldn't catch up with him.</p><p>He was told that the plot had already deviated many times. This time, when going to Princess Chang's residence, in the original story, he should have bitten his tongue off in despair, but now he was alive and well. Perhaps this change would trigger a butterfly effect, altering the plot once again.</p><p>Jiang Juan reassured himself, sat up, and had Lan Ting comb his hair, unaware that Xue Fangli was sitting on the bed, thoughtfully staring at him.</p><p>What is there to be afraid of?</p><p>There were no wolves or tigers at Princess Chang's banquet. Why was he so scared?</p><p>He didn't want to go, but Xue Fangli could simply say not to go if he didn't want to. However, seeing Jiang Juan so terrified, Xue Fangli felt it necessary to check on him.</p><p>His concubine, whom he cherished like a precious gem and feared losing, should be treated with even more respect by others.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his expression turning cold.</p><p>Grand Princess's Mansion.</p><p>Today's banquet was grand, with the Grand Princess inviting many guests. Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli arrived late, and by the time they reached the mansion, most of the guests had already arrived, making it a bustling scene.</p><p>No sooner had Xue Fangli stepped out of the carriage than a servant from the Grand Princess's mansion hurried to greet them. After exchanging pleasantries, he respectfully said, "Prince Wang, the Grand Princess has sent me here to await Your Excellency. There is an important matter she wishes to discuss with you. Please go and have a chat with her first."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at Xue Fangli, intending to shake his head and leave, but seeing that he couldn't get away temporarily, he said to Xue Fangli, "Prince Wang, please go quickly and return soon."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Aren't you going with Prince Wang?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. "I don't feel like moving. I'll wait for your return."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him a few times before nodding slightly and said in a calm tone, "If anyone dares to offend you and make you unhappy, you need not hesitate; just deal with them as you see fit."</p><p>"You are Prince Wang's concubine. Do whatever you wish."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, unsure why Prince Wang was telling him this, but he nodded nonetheless. "Alright, I'll remember that."</p><p>Xue Fangli left for the Grand Princess. A servant then led Jiang Juan inside. However, after just a few steps, Jiang Juan called out to someone.</p><p>"Brother."</p><p>Jiang Nian lightly called out to him. "What a coincidence, I ran into you as soon as I got out of the carriage."</p><p>Jiang Juan reluctantly turned his head, looking left and right. Fortunately, it was only Jiang Nian, not an unlucky pair, so he sighed in relief and politely greeted him. "Brother."</p><p>The incident that had occurred in Chengde Pavilion a few days ago made Jiang Juan feel rather embarrassed, which is why he had been observing Xue Fangli closely. However, this observation led to a misunderstanding in Jiang Nian's eyes.</p><p>"Count Huo is not here."</p><p>Jiang Nian looked at Jiang Juan's face—these few days, he had dreamed countless times of tracing a flower on this face. Jiang Nian hated and was furious, yet he could not deny that his younger brother was truly stunning.</p><p>But how beautiful he was, what could be done?</p><p>Jiang Juan was deeply infatuated with the Duke of Pingan. Until now, he himself had been betrayed, but he still subconsciously searched for traces of the Duke of Pingan. The Duke of Pingan would always be his unattainable desire.</p><p>Moreover, after the Duke of Pingan ascended to the throne, his brother missed out on so much. Between him and Jiang Juan, the one who lost was never himself.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Nian smiled slightly; the recent resentment and hatred finally subsided, and a secret sense of superiority arose in his heart.</p><p>He took a few steps forward, his expression enthusiastic. Without the previous malice, Jiang Nian said with a beaming smile, "Are you looking for Lord Duke? He was summoned by the chancellor, and Lord Duke said our matter should also…"</p><p>His words suddenly stopped. Jiang Nian apologized to Jiang Juan as if he had realized his mistake, "I shouldn't have told you this, considering that you admired Lord Duke for such a long time."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Nian looked uneasily at Jiang Juan. He was visibly worried on the surface, but in reality, he was leisurely enjoying Jiang Juan's expression.</p><p>In the past, every time he wanted to provoke Jiang Juan, mentioning the Duke of Pingan would suffice. Pretending to casually prick his heart a few times, his brother would fly into a rage, and yet, he could also bite back.</p><p>The most painful time he was bitten was when he was pushed into the lake, but it was precisely that push from Jiang Juan that allowed him to gain everything.</p><p>Thinking of this, the smile in Jiang Nian's eyes deepened.</p><p>The Duke of Pingan summoned the chancellor?</p><p>Was he going to tell the chancellor about the annulment of the engagement?</p><p>The plot might change, but according to the original setting, the chancellor and Princess Chang did not like Jiang Nian. They were the antagonists who resented the protagonist upon first meeting and could not be won over, and Jiang Juan looked at him sympathetically, "So that's how it is."</p><p>Sympathy?</p><p>What was he sympathetic about?</p><p>Jiang Nian always kept a close watch on Jiang Juan, naturally capturing his gaze as well. He found it unbelievable and absurd.</p><p>When did Jiang Juan even start sympathizing with him?</p><p>Jiang Juan's sympathy made him feel furious; Jiang Nian also despised the pity in his expression. In his eyes, if there had to be any sympathy, it should be something he bestowed upon Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Nian could no longer maintain his smile, "You..."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't notice his change in expression and merely offered a perfunctory comfort, "It's fine, the Marquis of Anping has already entered the palace to request His Majesty to grant you both a marriage."</p><p>Jiang Nian: "?"</p><p>He swallowed the unsaid words. Jiang Nian asked him, "What? Has His Majesty already granted the marriage?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Yes, didn't you know?"</p><p>Jiang Nian indeed did not know. The Marquis of Anping had mentioned to him that Empress Dowager Ma was more inclined towards Jiang Juan, so he planned to take advantage of Empress Dowager Ma and Princess Changzhu's absence to enter the palace and request Emperor Hongxing to grant them a marriage. However, when Jiang Nian inquired about it, the Marquis of Anping was vague, and Jiang Nian assumed he had his own plans.</p><p>The marriage had already been granted by His Majesty.</p><p>But if the marriage had been granted, why hadn't he told him?</p><p>Jiang Nian muttered to himself, "I really didn't know."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "ah," a bit guilty, "Perhaps he wanted to give you a surprise, but I mentioned it."</p><p>Initially, Jiang Nian was unhappy about Jiang Juan's sympathy, but now that he knew the marriage had been finalized, everything else became unimportant.</p><p>Since His Majesty has already granted the marriage, he and the Marquis of Anping were now bound together.</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled softly, and Jiang Juan's eyes, which had previously been so glaring, now seemed less obtrusive. He complained, "Lord Hou actually kept this from me without revealing a single word... If it weren't for my younger brother telling me, I wouldn't know when he would decide to inform me of this matter."</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent, feeling more and more convinced that Lord Hou's continuous silence about the betrothal was intended as a surprise for the main character. He could only nod awkwardly.</p><p>Jiang Nian felt quite sweet inside. Before he could say anything else, the voice of the eunuch began to resound.</p><p>"Princess Chang is here—!"</p><p>"The King of Li is here—!"</p><p>Princess Chang.</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly knelt down. After a jingle of bells and jade pendants, a fragrant breeze swept past as Princess Xue Fu Ying walked slowly towards him, stopping right in front of his face. Jiang Nian felt a wave of tension wash over him, clutching the sleeve of his robe tightly.</p><p>—Did Princess Chang already know about my relationship with Lord Hou? Did she intend to...?</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, Xue Fu Ying said, "Lift your head."</p><p>As a daughter of the imperial family, her tone was gentle yet authoritative, almost as if issuing an order.</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly obeyed. The corners of his lips curled upward into what he considered the most proper smile, but upon lifting his head, he realized that Xue Fu Ying was not speaking to him; she was looking at Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Nian's smiling face froze, but he quickly understood.</p><p>As a concubine of the King of Li, Jiang Juan did not need to bow and kowtow like him. However, as an elder, Xue Fu Ying still expected some form of reverence from her. But standing there without doing so, she naturally noticed Jiang Juan immediately.</p><p>Not knowing how to perform the proper etiquette, and with imperial family members strictly adhering to tradition, Jiang Juan's behavior would certainly leave a poor impression on Xue Fu Ying.</p><p>Thinking this, Jiang Nian curled his lips again, when suddenly, a pair of eyes fell upon him, cold and perilous. He felt as if he were being stared at by some ferocious beast, enveloped in an almost desperate fear.</p><p>Jiang Nian stiffly turned his head to the side.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, looking at Jiang Nian with a faint smile. His expression was lazy and aloof, as if Jiang Nian was insignificant like dust, barely worth a glance. Giving him even a look was already an exception.</p><p>That was the kind of gaze.</p><p>It seemed to see through everything about him, showing disdain, almost mocking him.</p><p>Guilt surged in his heart. Jiang Nian clenched his sleeves tighter. At that moment, he heard Xue Fuying speak up.</p><p>"He really is a good child, qīng gōng guò qīng."</p><p>Xue Fuying sized Jiang Juan up, finding her satisfactory. He grabbed Jiang Juan's hand, lightly tapping it twice on the back of his hand, then immediately led her to join the banquet without caring that she hadn't bowed to him, feeling no disrespect in this.</p><p>Jiang Nian was quite surprised. Xue Fuying took a couple of steps forward, swept his eyes over, and locked eyes with Jiang Nian, frowning slightly. "Whose child is this? Still looking around during the bowing ceremony, how ignorant!"</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly bowed low. "In reply to the Princess..."</p><p>But Xue Fuying didn't wait for him to finish speaking; he led Jiang Juan away. Jiang Nian could only bite his lip in silent fury.</p><p>This was the first time zhèn he had been called ignorant of manners.</p><p>He did bow, but it was just a momentary oversight. On the other hand, Jiang Juan hadn't bowed at all throughout, yet she was praised as a good child. When it came to himself, he was considered ignorant.</p><p>Jiang Nian felt stifled, clenching his fists harder and harder, but could only lower his head and wait for Xue Fuying to leave. However, in the next moment, he heard someone speak up with a light sneer.</p><p>"Unconvinced?"</p><p>The black-golden robe dragged behind him, piling up on the ground like clouds. The man's voice was cold but had substance. "Your thoughts, zhèn, the King is too lazy to pursue one by one, just this point."</p><p>"Stay away from him."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, but each word he enunciated carried a warning tone, chilling.</p><p>Jiang Nian's body was icy cold, and he felt his breath about to be stifled. Only until the man raised his foot and left did Jiang Juan slowly lift his head, only to see Jiang Juan turning around to grab Xue Fangli's sleeve. The man remained calm and indifferent as he brushed it away, and then—</p><p>gently held Jiang Juan's hand.</p><p>Jiang Nian looked at him expressionlessly.</p><p>Yes, he was jealous.</p><p>He was so unwilling to accept this; how could he not be jealous?</p><p>Why should Li Wang treat the one who couldn't compare to him with such gentleness, instead of his own brother?</p><p>But there was nothing to be done about it.</p><p>All his life, he had placed all his bets on Duke of Anping. Even if he was unwilling to accept this, he could not blame himself for anything.</p><p>Duke of Anping had upright morals and a steady personality, making him the most suitable match for him compared to the unpredictable Li Wang.</p><p>Duke of Anping was truly a virtuous man.</p><p>He would take good care of him.</p><p>Xue Fuying pulled Jiang Juan up to the upper seat.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat down, realizing that by taking this position, he might be unable to escape.</p><p>Jiang Juan could only pray for the plot to change.</p><p>Xue Fuying didn't have a haughty demeanor and was very approachable. Jiang Juan nodded slightly, and Xue Fuying couldn't help but marvel at how obedient he seemed, exclaiming, "What a good boy."</p><p>Xie Fu Ying sighed and said with a sense of guilt, "The matter of the engagement cancellation is our fault to you."</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately became vigilant. He hurriedly shook his head, "It’s not our fault; I’m doing well now too."</p><p>——He couldn’t let the main character be bullied because of the engagement cancellation; otherwise, he would definitely bear a grudge, or even a huge one.</p><p>This nephew wasn’t someone easy to get along with.</p><p>Jiang Juan got engaged canceled and married into Prince Li’s mansion. Xie Fu Ying instinctively felt that there was a connection with Marquis Anping, so after scolding Xie Fang Li, she had been urging him not to bully Jiang Juan.</p><p>Even though Jiang Juan said he was doing well, Xie Fu Ying still wasn’t quite at ease. She smiled and said, "You this child, the Prince really likes you. If the Prince truly bullies you, don’t endure it; just come to the palace, and the Prince will take care of you."</p><p>The Prince wouldn’t bully me, Jiang Juan thought for a moment and seriously told her, "The Prince treats me very well, really very well, so much that I even have to thank Marquis for his engagement cancellation favor."</p><p>Xie Fu Ying was taken aback, but he found it amusing instead. Xie Fang Li also raised the corner of his mouth, speaking in a light tone, "Indeed, it’s an engagement cancellation favor."</p><p>Xie Fu Ying shook her head; she still wasn’t quite at ease, but she couldn’t say much more either. She teased Xie Fang Li, saying, "Such a good child, you got him cheaply indeed."</p><p>As the words fell, Xie Fu Ying lifted her head and walked away briskly. He hurriedly pulled Jiang Juan’s hand and said softly, "Feiyue, it’s this child."</p><p>Feiyue? Su Feiyue?</p><p>It sounded like “horse whip.”</p><p>Jiang Juan also lifted his head. Like Xie Fu Ying, the moment Su Feiyue saw Jiang Juan, she said full of guilt, "We are unworthy to you."</p><p>Xie Fu Ying covered her mouth and smiled, "Just now, the Prince asked, Juijui said she still had to thank Zhao Shi for his engagement cancellation favor. He’s doing well in the mansion.”</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled lightly, "Is that so?"</p><p>"That's good."</p><p>Hearing them say this, Jiang Juan reluctantly put down her heart.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan had also researched this segment of the plot. She believed that the Empress Dowager and the Marquis were so angry mainly because a cannon-fodder character with the same name as him had bitten his tongue to death, and Duke of Anping could be considered an indirect murderer.</p><p>Now that she had broken off the engagement, Jiang Juan was fine and living well. If the Marquis and Empress Dowager did not feel too guilty, it might be a little better for them.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Juan sighed in relief, bit her chopsticks, and looked at the food. Suddenly, she heard "bang" as Su Feiyue put down her wine cup and said to Xue Fuying, "I heard that Young Master Er also came today, call him over to see."</p><p>Like Xue Fuying, he only found out about the broken engagement at the banquet. Su Feiyue was furious, especially after learning that Jiang Juan had become Consort of the Exile King.</p><p>The Exile King was notorious for his reputation, and since Su Feiyue had once been his Tutor, she knew well what kind of person Xue Fangli was—brutal and capricious. When he heard that Jiang Juan was living well, he could only listen to it, but his heart was still filled with anger.</p><p>Xue Fuying sighed naturally understanding the Marquis's intention of having Jiang Nian call him over and knowing his concern for Jiang Juan, so she did not obstruct him and gave a glance to the eunuch, "Go, call Young Master Er over."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Why must they involve the main character?</p><p>Jiang Juan had an ominous feeling in her heart. Su Feiyue looked at her and said gently, "In these past days, you must have suffered quite a bit of injustice. Regardless, we will give you an explanation for this matter of breaking off the engagement."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>What is going on with this novel?</p><p>When she wanted to follow the plot honestly, the plot had to make a huge turnaround and not let her do so. Now that she did not want to follow it anymore, the plot was backfiring, forcing her to face the main character being tormented.</p><p>How could the plot be so rebellious?</p>
