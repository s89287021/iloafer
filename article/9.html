						<p>Xue Fangli froze for a moment, then burst into laughter.</p><p>He started with a low chuckle, perhaps genuinely finding it amusing, and later his laughter grew quite boisterous.</p><p>Who would be so naive?</p><p>After a while, Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said in a nasty tone, "But this prince is just such a person."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised her eyes and said seriously, "No, that's not true."</p><p>Her gaze was clear and her voice firm. Xue Fangli met her eyes, and involuntarily, he recalled the hand he had gripped tightly during his most excruciating pain.</p><p>Soft, warm.</p><p>He clutched it forcefully as if holding onto the last connection to humanity, even with a hint of possessiveness.</p><p>But that wouldn't do.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyelids.</p><p>It seemed he was being too amiable and interested in this Third Young Master.</p><p>He wouldn't keep him for long.</p><p>Given his frailty, he couldn't last much longer.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Xue Fangli entered the carriage expressionlessly. He lifted his robe to sit down, and his demeanor turned cold.</p><p>Jiang Juan noticed this but didn't pay it too much mind, assuming that Xue Fangli was unwell and quietly sat on the side.</p><p>The carriage rumbled as the horses trotted over the cobblestones, moving away from the grand palace and entering the bustling market where clamor grew louder. Jiang Juan recognized it as the place he had wanted to explore that morning. He lifted the curtain to look outside, then turned to glance at Xue Fangli for a moment before hesitating slightly and finally giving up.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>I'll come back another time.</p><p>Jiang Juan released his hand, allowing the curtain to fall, with beads jingling as he occasionally toyed with the glass beads.</p><p>Xue Fangli had expected him to ask about something, but Jiang Juan remained silent, even unusually calm. Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan without expression.</p><p>Jiang Juan sensed something and looked over curiously, asking, "Prince Wang, what is it?"</p><p>He has been staring at me the whole time.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond but lowered his eyelids instead.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli finally spoke, though not to Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Go to the villa."</p><p>Jiang Juan's sudden movement pulled on the beads, causing them to jingle loudly.</p><p>Ah, the villa.</p><p>The plot seems to be unfolding.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the driver turned the carriage. The narrow street almost became completely occupied, and passersby made way, knowing well that this was the carriage of the Wang Family—embellished with gold and jade inlays and adorned with glass decorations, exuding utmost luxury.</p><p>"Whoa!"</p><p>At the same time, a carriage was approaching head-on. The driver tightened the reins in time to avoid it, and the young man inside asked softly, "Why did we stop?"</p><p>The young man's face turned pale as if he had recalled something terribly frightening, and his fingers trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>Dian Cui, noticing his abnormal behavior, asked with concern, "Second Young Master, are you alright? Did you get into an accident falling into the water recently and your body hasn't recovered completely..."</p><p>Second Young Master.</p><p>Yes, he was still the Second Young Master of the Shangshu Mansion, not Li Wang's concubine.</p><p>The young man, Jiang Nian, slowly exhaled, finally calming down. He shook his head and forced a smile, "I'm fine."</p><p>Dian Cui was still somewhat concerned and kept staring at him, but she soon got distracted.</p><p>Before entering the mansion, Dian Cui had heard that Second Young Master was the fairest man in the capital. But when she first saw Second Young Master, she didn't find him particularly handsome. Later, after secretly asking a few of her sisters, she realized it was because she was too shallow-sighted.</p><p>Dian Cui could neither read nor write, so she had yet to understand Second Young Master's beauty, but the whole capital praised Young Master for his looks, so he must be beautiful. She only thought she was ignorant.</p><p>Noticing her gaze, Jiang Nian asked with amusement, "Why are you looking at me like that again?"</p><p>Dian Cui replied, "Young Master is handsome after all; he is the fairest man in the capital."</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled and gently stopped her, "Don't say such things; it would be laughable if others heard."</p><p>Dian Cui stuck out her tongue, "Everyone says so."</p><p>Jiang Nian could not help but feel helpless, yet his mood was surprisingly good.</p><p>In his previous life, he had been given to Prince Li, and now he was anxiously staying in the Palace of Prince Li. He dared not leave the courtyard for fear of encountering another incident where Prince Li went mad and dragged him into the pond. This situation was vastly different from his current relaxed state, chatting with the maidservants.</p><p>Yes, it was in his previous life.</p><p>Heaven be merciful, after Jiang Nian died in depression, he had been granted a second chance.</p><p>For example, befriending his classmates and several princes.</p><p>For example, accepting the love from Duke Pingan.</p><p>In his previous life, to everyone's surprise, the throne eventually fell on Duke Pingan. He would become the most prestigious person in the world.</p><p>As long as His Majesty approved, he would only have to wait for the palace to grant him marriage.</p><p>He would also become an incomparably noble person.</p><p>The villa was located in a suburb of the capital.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, it was already late spring when flowers had all withered, but atop the mountain, there was still a sea of wisteria blossoms.</p><p>Upon arriving at the place, Jiang Juan was isolated in a separate courtyard. Once everything was prepared, the high official came for a visit.</p><p>Learning that the Prince was staying at the villa, he hurriedly brought a box of spices up the mountain, of course, the high official also conveniently carried the wolf cub Jiang Juan had saved.</p><p>"The doctor has examined it; there's nothing serious, just needs some time to recover," said the high official.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and squatted in front of the cage. The young wolf seemed to recognize him, pressing its head against the cage and silently shedding tears.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed, "So pitiful."</p><p>He asked Lanting for a handkerchief and carefully wiped the tears from the little wolf's eyes. Lanting thought it inappropriate and whispered, "Young Master, let me do it."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "No need."</p><p>The wolf pup might be in severe pain, with too many tears to wipe away completely. Jiang Juan petted its head; Gao Gan Shi looked on perplexed.</p><p>It was just an animal, after all—why should he bother handling it personally?</p><p>This Third Young Master truly is a peculiar man.</p><p>While thinking about this, Gao Gan Shi did not reveal his thoughts on the surface. He smiled and said, "Lady Wang, if there are no other instructions, I shall take my leave."</p><p>"Very well," Jiang Juan replied, suddenly remembering something and calling him back, "Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Is the Prince in good health?"</p><p>Gao Gan Shi was taken aback and evaded the question with, "...Yes, he is."</p><p>In reality, he was far from it.</p><p>Having served in the manor for several years, Gao Gan Shi knew that the Prince rarely visited this villa unless his condition had deteriorated to an unbearable state.</p><p>—Continuous dull pain, excruciating agony during attacks, and inability to rest properly would even exhaust a Great Golden Immortal.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Oh," then continued wiping the tears from the little wolf's eyes. Gao Gan Shi left after that.</p><p>Watching on, Lanting murmured softly, "Actually, this little wolf pup isn't as pitiful as it seems. At least, it met Young Master."</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Lanting suddenly remembered something and exclaimed, "Ah," then said irritably, "Young Master, you need a medicinal bath tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback: "Herb bath?"</p><p>However, after recalling the character's setup, Jiang Juan understood.</p><p>His character pretended to have a mental illness, but had real congenital weaknesses; it wasn't surprising that he would use herb baths.</p><p>But right now on the mountain, where could they find any herbs? Jiang Juan said uncertainly, "Maybe another day?"</p><p>"No way," Lanting shook her head, not daring to make a joke about it. She thought for a moment and said, "I'll go ask Senior He."</p><p>Saying that, Lanting hurriedly got up and went to catch up with Senior He.</p><p>Senior He had quick feet, and in just a little while, he was out of sight. Lanting could only continue walking. She ran at a small pace but didn't expect to collide with someone as she stepped onto the stone bridge. The two bumped into each other.</p><p>"Ouch——!"</p><p>This person stumbled from the impact, dropping the wooden box they were holding in their hands. Just as Lanting was about to apologize, she looked up and saw it was Senior He.</p><p>"Manager, our master needs regular herb baths; does the manor have…"</p><p>"Do you know what you've done?"</p><p>Senior He interrupted her with a pale face.</p><p>Lanting was frightened, "I…I…"</p><p>Senior He's lips moved, but fear prevented him from saying a word. After a long while, he stammered, "This is the fragrance that His Excellency needs; you're going to kill all of us!"</p><p>"I didn't..." Lan Ting said uneasily, "It wasn't intentional, I didn't know."</p><p>High Official Shi's expression was grim, "The Prince doesn't care about these things, he only wants the spices."</p><p>Unfortunately, the spices had been soaked in water and were now unusable.</p><p>And it was precisely when the Prince's condition was at its worst that they lacked the soothing effect of the spices; he would become even more ruthless, adding to his madness!</p><p>Thinking of this, High Official Shi's hair stood on end, completely unsure of what to do.</p><p>Just as they were at an impasse, a voice sounded.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>It was Jiang Juan who had arrived.</p><p>After waiting for a while and still not seeing Lan Ting return, Jiang Juan came out looking for her. Instead, he found High Official Shi dejected and tears in Lan Ting's eyes. Jiang Juan asked her, "Why are you crying?"</p><p>"The Prince's spices..."</p><p>Lan Ting lowered her head in self-reproach, explaining the entire situation. High Official Shi added, "The Prince is particular about flavors; he has grown accustomed to this spice. Now—"</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>High Official Shi sighed heavily. Upon hearing this, Lan Ting knew she had caused a huge problem and lowered her head, tears welling up in her eyes. Jiang Juan, who hated seeing girls cry, hurriedly comforted her, "Don't cry, let's think of a solution together."</p><p>High Official Shi: "..."</p><p>What other solutions were there?</p><p>High Official Shi was flustered, but after consoling Lan Ting, Jiang Juan suddenly remembered something and asked anxiously, "Lan Ting, is the sachet I gave you this morning still with you?"</p><p>"In," Lan Ting, although puzzled, still fished a sachet out of her pocket. "Here you are."</p><p>Jiang Juan heaved a sigh of relief and said to Gao Guanshi, "Why don't we give the sachet to His Highness first?"</p><p>Gao Guanshi seemed somewhat reluctant.</p><p>Not just any scent would do; the Prince only desired this particular spice and was accustomed to its fragrance. Furthermore, the sedative effect of this spice could even help the Prince fall asleep in larger quantities, despite its significant side effects.</p><p>Once asleep, he would be completely unaware, and the following day, he would feel groggy.</p><p>Of course, Gao Guanshi did not mention these effects to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Gao Guanshi struggled to say, "It might not work."</p><p>Jiang Juan insisted, "Let's give it a try."</p><p>In the morning when entering the palace, Xue Fangli had asked him about the scent on his body and said it was acceptable, so he supposed the sachet would not be unpleasant.</p><p>Gao Guanshi hesitated. He had already committed a major mistake; carrying this stupid sachet around only made things worse. He did not want any more trouble.</p><p>Seeing Gao Guanshi's reluctance, Jiang Juan decided to take matters into his own hands and said, "I'll ask His Highness myself."</p><p>Gao Guanshi looked at him in surprise but was glad someone else would take the blame. Hurriedly, he said, "Thank you, Princess—this way please."</p><p>Gao Guanshi led the way, and soon they arrived at a pavilion.</p><p>"His Highness…"</p><p>"The scent?"</p><p>Heguan Shi listened to the statement and stammered for a long time, unable to form a complete sentence. Jiang Juan could no longer bear it and answered on his behalf: "Your Highness, your spices are useless."</p><p>"They all fell into the lake..."</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered and immediately added: "But this morning you asked about my sachet; I got one. Why don’t you use it for now?"</p><p>Heguan Shi: "... "</p><p>Use it for now.</p><p>He regretted it deeply in his heart. To be honest, Your Highness might still leave him a whole body, but now he probably wouldn't even have his ashes left.</p><p>Heguan Shi nearly burst into laughter.</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent as well.</p><p>Silence, complete silence.</p><p>It was unclear how long had passed when the two maids on the side moved the screen, and the man got up from the bed. His long hair seemed to blend with the intricate black-gold robe he wore.</p><p>"Sachet?"</p><p>He slowly opened his mouth, his voice seductive.</p><p>Jiang Juan took a few steps forward, stretching out her hand. On his soft white palm was a sachet. "This one; you said it smelled quite good this morning."</p><p>Xue Fangli received it with weary eyes. In the dim light, his pale and slender fingers passed through the fine red cord, then lifted the sachet to sniff.</p><p>It had the scent of white peonies, orchids in autumn, and Cassia seeds.</p><p>Apart from that, there was a trace of another smell clinging to it.</p><p>Very light, yet incomparably sweet.</p><p>"It's not its taste."</p><p>With a flick of his finger, Xue Fangli let go, and the sachet fell to the ground. He lifted his eyelids to stare at Jiang Juan, beneath the dense network of blood vessels, his eyes flushed with blood.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled nonchalantly, "Probably won't do."</p>
