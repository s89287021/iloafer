						<p>"Juan'er, are you going to the library?"</p><p>Jiang Juan just finished packing his things. When his roommate heard the noise, he quickly took out his headphones and said, "Hold a seat for me, I'll be there after I finish this."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. After hearing him agree, the roommate turned back around, typing away on the keyboard rapidly while controlling his character in an online game and chatting with someone.</p><p>"Juan'er? He's my roommate."</p><p>"You definitely haven't heard of him. He was sick before, took a leave of absence, and hasn't come to school ever since."</p><p>"It's not exactly all that great; he has heart disease. He doesn't need to go to school, but he needs surgery."</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Juan closed the dormitory door and walked out of the building, feeling a wave of heat hit him.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed.</p><p>It was so hot; he really wanted to go back to his dormitory to turn on the air conditioner.</p><p>Why is the library so far away?</p><p>When will the school bus come?</p><p>As of now, it had been three or four months since Jiang Juan returned from the book.</p><p>In his family's eyes, after a successful surgery, Jiang Juan had merely fallen into a five-day coma due to extreme weakness. In reality, however, Jiang Juan had spent many years in another era.</p><p>Returning to modern times, Jiang Juan felt quite disoriented. Seeing him always gloomy every day, his cousin suggested to the family that Jiang Juan continue his studies.</p><p>Jiang Juan almost made the hospital her home, but she never fell behind with her studies. Her family had hired a tutor for her, and she also took the college entrance examination. However, due to her health condition, she was granted leave without officially enrolling.</p><p>With the successful surgery, life should finally get back on track, so Jiang Juan enrolled at University A. Who could have thought that after being an empress for such a long time, she would return as a student and, unfortunately, find herself in the middle of the semester. She had several papers to write and many books to read, leaving her feeling despondent.</p><p>After waiting for quite some time, the school bus finally arrived. Jiang Juan got on and quickly reached the library. Jiang Juan didn't arrive particularly early; almost all the seats on the first floor were occupied. Therefore, as soon as she entered the elevator, she directly chose the sixth floor. Recently, the library would often be without power in the evenings, making higher floors more inconvenient, which is why fewer people went there.</p><p>Jiang Juan picked a window seat and started reading. Ah, there are so many words. I feel a bit dizzy from all these characters. Jiang Juan didn't read for long before she slumped onto the table. Just then, her phone on the side lit up. She reached over to check it; it was her roommate leaving. [Juien, I'm here.] [On which floor are you?] Jiang Juan typed a few words in response. [On the sixth floor.]</p><p>Twenty minutes later, her roommate emerged from the elevator wearing headphones and listening to music, swaying along with the melody. After taking just a few steps, he noticed where Jiang Juan was sitting and his face changed. "Juien, why are you sitting here?"</p><p>Roommate pressed the earphone to pause the music and whispered to Jiang Juan, "Hurry up and leave. We can't sit in this spot."</p><p>Jiang Juan was puzzled, "Why can't we sit here?"</p><p>The roommate muttered, "We can't provoke that madman."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>He looked at his roommate blankly. There wasn't anything special about this spot; Jiang Juan had chosen it randomly. If pressed, she would say that it was relatively quiet and had a good view.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan's confusion, the roommate remembered that he hadn't been in school for a while and explained further, "Do you know the Xue family? That old man we often see on TV, Mr. Xue."</p><p>As he spoke, the roommate took out his phone, typed in a name, and showed it to Jiang Juan. It was indeed an elderly person with considerable prestige. Jiang Juan nodded, "Mm-hmm, I know him."</p><p>The roommate continued, "They have only one son in their family, who is the future crown prince. He studies at our school, and he—"</p><p>"He has severe bipolar disorder."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Do you know why our library is so luxurious? During military training, he went berserk and fought with someone, so his family donated a lot of money."</p><p>In fact, if one had to say, the blame didn't entirely lie with this young master Xue. After all, it was the other person who had secretly filmed a lady in the bathroom. When they came out, they ran into Young Master Xue. The person feared being reported to school and begged while threatening suicide, constantly harassing him, which ultimately enraged Young Master Xue.</p><p>What happened after he was enraged was unclear to most people since there were no cameras in the bathroom, but when security arrived, the man was covered in blood. He had been pressed against a railing with half of his body hanging out. Young Master Xue's voice was cold, "Still want to die? I'll make it happen for you."</p><p>"I think he might have really wanted to kill that person back then."</p><p>The roommate had been at the scene and said that the crown prince's aura was truly terrifying. After telling Jiang Juan about what happened, he added, "Later, one of his former high school classmates said he has bipolar disorder, so..."</p><p>"Come on, come on. He often sits in this spot. Let's move somewhere else. Who would dare provoke someone like him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan seemed a bit distracted.</p><p>The surname Xue.</p><p>And this manner of behavior?</p><p>What’s going on? Is it just a coincidence?</p><p>"Jade."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan freeze, his roommate hurriedly grabbed him and pushed, "Hurry up, in case he has an episode, we won’t…"</p><p>With a “bang,” a bottle of mineral water was placed on the table. The sound wasn’t loud, but it came too suddenly for Jiang Juan to react instinctively by looking over.</p><p>He saw a hand, elegantly shaped with clear joints.</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched; he almost held his breath.</p><p>The other person was a tall and slender young man with piercing eyes and a cold demeanor.</p><p>His skin was very pale, but his lips were a deep red, making him look like someone with rosy cheeks and white teeth. However, he exuded an aura of hostility. He raised his eyelids and glanced over lazily.</p><p>In the next second, the young man’s movement also paused.</p><p>Silence, a long silence.</p><p>After a while, the young man spoke. He let out one word, "You…"</p><p>His roommate nearly fainted with fright. Just as they were talking about Cao Cao, Xue Fangli appeared here.</p><p>What had he just said?</p><p>In case he has an episode.</p><p>Grass.</p><p>Did he hear it?</p><p>And Juan'er, sitting in his usual spot.</p><p>The roommate struggled to swallow a mouthful of saliva, feeling that their fate was sealed, especially when Xue Fangli picked up the bottle of mineral water he had put on the table again.</p><p>They were done for.</p><p>The roommate's legs went weak, and everything started to spin before her eyes. But the next moment—</p><p>"Do you want to drink?" Xue Fangli asked.</p><p>The roommate was taken aback, "Ah? No…"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "I want to."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, his movements natural as he unscrewed the bottle cap and handed the mineral water to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan took it.</p><p>Dew still clung to the bottle of mineral water, emanating a chill; Jiang Juan's fingertips were soaked. He lowered his head and took a small sip before slowly raising his eyes, squinting slightly as he smiled at Xue Fangli, "Thank you, you're really kind."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his eyebrows twitching but saying nothing.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan said again, "I'm Jiang Juan, nickname Jiang Lian."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Xue Fangli."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and slowly said, "Hello, nice to meet you."</p><p>Xue Fangli let out a light hum, reaching out to pinch the soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face. He said with a smile that was not quite a smile, "Wrong, it's been a long time since we last met."</p><p>Jiang Juan stared back at him, his eyes sparkling. After a long while, he finally changed his mind and said, "Mm, it's been a long time since we last met."</p><p>They had been reunited after a long separation, but someone seemed very redundant.</p><p>Roommate: "??"</p><p>What situation was this??</p><p>Shouldn't they be getting beaten up?</p><p>What about the bottle of mineral water in Jian'er's hand??</p><p>Xue Fangli even returned the bottle cap to him!?</p><p>This didn't seem right!?</p>
