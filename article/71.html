						<p>Jiang Juan was extremely anxious about Qian Liang's misfortune and knew that Qian Liang was innocent, but—</p><p>he was taken away.</p><p>In the guest room, Jiang Juan was placed on the bed. Seeing that she was no longer needed, the maid quietly retreated, closing the door softly with a "creak."</p><p>After a short sound, the room fell silent. For some reason, Jiang Juan suddenly felt tense.</p><p>He shouldn't have looked around or thought too much.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't feel awkward seeing the Prince now.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very annoyed. His pale fingertips suddenly touched his forehead. Xue Fangli lowered his head and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Shaking his head randomly, Jiang Juan's eyes wandered, not daring to meet Xue Fangli's gaze. "Nothing."</p><p>After saying that, he added, "Prince, I really have nothing."</p><p>Xue Fangli kept watching him. Jiang Juan's discomfort was noted in his eyes, but he didn't react much. Instead, he said calmly, "Let the physician see you first; take some rest."</p><p>No matter what, Jiang Juan could only accept it. He replied with an "oh," climbed onto the bed, and lay flat.</p><p>But a few seconds later, Jiang Juan sat up again.</p><p>"…It's too hard."</p><p>Jiang Juan reached out to touch the sore spot on his back.</p><p>At Liang Wangfu, knowing how precious he was, Xue Fangli had several layers of soft padding laid everywhere he sat or slept so that Jiang Juan wouldn't complain about pain.</p><p>But this was General Mansion. General Jiang wasn't someone who enjoyed luxuries; not only were there no soft pads, but the beds in the general's mansion were even harder than elsewhere. Jiang Juan couldn't get used to sleeping on them.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Hold you?"</p><p>Not that it wasn't possible, there was nothing to stop it either. The Prince was comfortable to sit and sleep on, but Jiang Juan went through a series of mental preparations before slowly saying, "Maybe... let's not?"</p><p>The Prince hugging him merely meant letting Jiang Juan lie in his arms. Jiang Juan had always slept happily and comfortably before, but now—</p><p>The grotesque scenes from the book flooded into his mind again, refusing to dissipate. He sighed hopelessly and muttered to himself, "Actually, the bed isn't that hard; I can still sleep if I endure it for a while."</p><p>"Prince, don't bother with me."</p><p>After saying this, Jiang Juan leaned back again.</p><p>He endured it once, twice, three times...</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't take it anymore. The bed was really too hard, and the discomfort was unbearable. He started tossing and turning on the bed as if lying not on a bed but in a pan of hot oil, burning him so much that he kept flipping over.</p><p>After staring at him for a while, Xue Fangli reached out to embrace him, but Jiang Juan instinctively pushed him away. However, Xue Fangli firmly pressed him into his arms with a dark look in his eyes, "If you can't get used to sleeping like this, why not let me hold you?"</p><p>"Are you still upset that this King kissed you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>He slightly opened his eyes and after a while of staring blankly, shook his head and said, "... No."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him emotionally, "Then why won't you let this King hold you again?"</p><p>It wasn't that he refused; it just felt awkward.</p><p>How should he explain?</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't bother explaining to the Prince. After all, if he had to explain properly, he would have to start from when he picked up the book "Taiping Youji." But that was—</p><p>How embarrassing? Jiang Juan felt a bit helpless. "I didn't say you couldn't hug me," Jiang Juan said sheepishly, "aren't you hugging me right now?" Xue Fangli did not respond, only staring at Jiang Juan intently, clearly disbelieving his explanation. Jiang Juan was in a dilemma. If he told the truth, he would feel embarrassed. But if he didn't, Prince Wang seemed to have misunderstood. Just as Jiang Juan was struggling with this mental conflict, Xue Fangli spoke again, coolly, "If you don't like this prince being close to you, just tell me directly; it's not worth crying over or sulking about." "Don't be like her... Jiang Qingmei, hating this prince yet constantly summoning him by your side." Why was she bringing up the Lady Yu Mei again? Jiang Juan wanted to stop her, but before he could speak, Xue Fangli continued in a cold tone, "She always summons this prince to her side, eager to play the role of an ordinary mother in this world, pouring tea for this prince, preparing meals, yet she still poisons his tea and puts blood in his food." "Prince Wang..." Jiang Juan was taken aback. Every time Prince Wang mentioned Lady Yu Mei, it wasn't good news. What was even more terrifying was that Prince Wang had told him many things about her over the years, but there were always aspects Jiang Juan didn't know, each time resulting in Lady Yu Mei torturing Prince Wang. Jiang Juan gradually learned more about Prince Wang's past, but he felt it was only the tip of the iceberg; Prince Wang had endured far more hardships than what he had openly said. Therefore, every time Prince Wang mentioned Lady Yu Mei, Jiang Juan would feel soft-hearted. This time was no exception, though this time Jiang Juan also felt a bit guilty. If not for him, Prince Wang wouldn't have been so suspicious.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "It's not that I don't like it..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Why won't you let me hold you?"</p><p>After going around in circles, they ended up back at this question.</p><p>He had to be more honest.</p><p>He couldn't let the Prince regale in wild thoughts.</p><p>Isn't it just embarrassing?</p><p>Jiang Juan comforted herself and mustered up the courage to say, "Prince..."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and met his gaze. Jiang Juan found himself involuntarily recalling a painting—ambiguous postures, familiar scenes—one day, he had grazed the inside of his thigh while riding a horse, and the Prince had treated him in the same way.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You're not annoying. Why are you crying? And why won't you let me hold you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed in resignation, his gaze darting around aimlessly. In desperation, he blurted out a random reason, "Why are you asking me? We said no kissing, you gave me a bite, but you bit me many times and even kissed me again at the end."</p><p>"You're being so unreasonable. Why should I cry or refuse your hug?"</p><p>After all, it was just an excuse, Jiang Juan didn't say it with confidence. While complaining to Xue Fangli, he secretly tried to crawl out of his embrace, but before long, his ankle was grabbed, pulling him back. Xue Fangli pressed Jiang Juan into his arms again, "Yes, I was too unreasonable."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head and looked at the hand that restrained him in his arms, sighing gloomily, "If you're being so unreasonable, why don't you reflect on it properly? Why bring me back?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "To make up for it."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "How are you going to compensate?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "It's not that I don't like it..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Why won't you let me hold you?"</p><p>After circling around the issue, they found themselves back at square one.</p><p>He needed to be more honest.</p><p>He couldn't allow the Prince to continue with his wild speculations.</p><p>Wasn't it just a matter of embarrassment?</p><p>Jiang Juan calmed himself and gathered his courage to say, "Prince..."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes to meet Jiang Juan's gaze. As he stared, Jiang Juan involuntarily recalled an image—ambiguous postures, scenes that seemed familiar—a day when he had grazed the inside of his thigh while riding a horse, and the Prince had treated him in the same way.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You're not annoying. Why are you crying? And why won't you let me hold you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed dejectedly, his gaze wandering around aimlessly. In desperation, he blurted out a flimsy excuse, "Why are you asking me? We agreed no kissing, but you bit me and then kissed me again at the end."</p><p>"You're being so unreasonable. Why should I cry or refuse your hug?"</p><p>Since it was just an excuse, Jiang Juan lacked confidence in his words. While complaining to Xue Fangli, he tried to crawl out of his embrace. However, before long, his ankle was grabbed, pulling him back. Xue Fangli pressed Jiang Juan into his arms again, "Yes, I was too unreasonable."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head and looked at the hand that restrained him in his arms, sighing gloomily, "If you're being so unreasonable, why don't you reflect on it properly? Why bring me back?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "To make up for it."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "How are you going to compensate?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "It's not that I dislike it..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Why won't you let me hold you?"</p><p>Circling around the issue once more, they found themselves back at the starting point.</p><p>He needed to be more honest.</p><p>He couldn't allow the Prince to dwell on wild speculations.</p><p>Wasn't it just a matter of embarrassment?</p><p>Jiang Juan calmed himself and mustered the courage to say, "Prince..."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes to meet Jiang Juan's gaze. As he stared, Jiang Juan involuntarily recalled an image—ambiguous postures, scenes that seemed familiar—a day when he had grazed the inside of his thigh while riding a horse, and the Prince had treated him in the same way.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...

Why bring me back?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "To make up for it."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "How are you going to compensate?"</p><p>Xue Fanglei asked him, "Do you want to kiss me back or bite me back?"</p><p>Perhaps it was because he mentioned Yu Meiren, the man's interest seemed not very high, and his expression was somewhat drowsy. If it were on any other day, Jiang Juan might have really bitten him out of anger and shame, but now she couldn't quite bring herself to do it, since she had just learned about the miserable past of the Prince.</p><p>Jiang Juan said softly, "I'm not like you who enjoys biting others."</p><p>As for kissing her back, Jiang Juan pretended she hadn't heard.</p><p>He chose neither option. Xue Fanglei stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before saying slowly, "You hate this King getting close to you."</p><p>Jiang Juan shuddered and hurriedly shook her head, "No, really, Your Highness, I don't."</p><p>Xue Fanglei merely lowered his eyelids, speaking in a calm tone, "There's no need to comfort this King. If you truly hate it, you don't need to consider this King, nor should you torment yourself."</p><p>"She sees this King only as mutual torture. You don't have to make yourself miserable for this King's sake."</p><p>The man's voice was calm, but Jiang Juan felt that he was hiding many emotions. She panicked, feeling like she had made the Prince even more upset.</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan took Xue Fanglei's hand and placed it on her heart, "Your Highness, I feel a bit unwell. Would you massage me? Please?"</p><p>To prove that she didn't hate his closeness, Jiang Juan took a deep breath and said slowly, "You've taken advantage of me so much. I haven't decided yet whether to kiss you back or bite you back, I owe you one, let me think about it for a while, okay?"</p><p>The young man looked up at Xue Fanglei, his lashes fluttering beneath the glistening water light. He felt uneasy and even more nervous. Jiang Juan looked only at Xue Fanglei, seeing only his compassion, his affection, his focus, and his seriousness, all seemingly enjoyed solely by Xue Fanglei.</p><p>At this moment, the young man was no longer the small bodhisattva on the lotus seat, untainted and free from worldly concerns. Sitting in Xue Fanglei's arms, he fell into the trap of soft-heartedness and drifted into the tumultuous red dust of life.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Xue Fanglei responded with a single word. He lifted his red lips slightly but then hid it without trace. Xue Fanglei lowered his head, his fingers moving gently to massage Jiang Juan's heart softly.</p><p>Just like this.</p><p>Whether or not he minded being close to her, it did not bother him.</p><p>All he needed from Little Bodhisattva was some pity and care.</p><p>He was so pitiful, Little Bodhisattva; please show more kindness and be gentler with him.</p><p>Liang Qingyuan Courtyard.</p><p>"Young Master, plum blossom iced tea."</p><p>His father had punished him by making him run thirty laps on the battlefield. By the time he had completed less than half of them, he was already in bad shape, almost being carried back; it seemed like he would lose half of his life.</p><p>The icy plum blossom iced tea was quite refreshing. Jiang Qingliang sighed deeply but still felt hot. He grabbed a book from the desk to fan himself with, but before he could even start, "thud," the cover fell to the ground. Jiang Qingliang looked down.</p><p>Oh, it's The Travels of Taiping.</p><p>The very book Juan Ge had touched earlier.</p><p>He was too lazy to pick it up, so he left it be. He was still puzzled by this; the window god had mysteriously told him that this book was good, but Jiang Qingliang had not read it. To him, travelogues were rather boring, so he had left it on the desk.</p><p>While thinking about it, Jiang Qingliang glanced at the book idly, and his movements froze all of a sudden.</p><p>The cover had fallen, and the book in his hand should have only had the frontispiece left. However, there was still a cover with beautiful calligraphy written on it.</p><p>—Spring Palace Picture Album.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "???"</p><p>Grass.</p><p>How could it be a spring palace illustration book?</p><p>Juan Ge just touched and looked at the book, hoping no one would misunderstand him as spending his days looking at such things?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang broke down, feeling more wronged than Dou E. However, in a flash of inspiration, Jiang Qingliang thought of something.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>No way!</p><p>Juan Ge's face suddenly turned red.</p><p>Juan Ge kept saying there was nothing wrong and everything was fine.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, Juan Ge really didn't have an episode of mental illness. He simply had thin skin and accidentally saw the 'Spring Palace Illustration Album,' leading to a series of events afterwards.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Wasn't he being wronged?</p><p>Twelve laps! He ran twelve full laps around the battlefield!</p><p>He was dying of injustice!</p><p>Upon discovering the truth, Jiang Qingliang slowly exhaled a long breath.</p><p>Who could blame him?</p><p>Juan Ge didn't lie and kept insisting that everything was fine.</p><p>He did not believe it, yet he insisted on managing the matter by calling a doctor.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang nearly vomited blood, drinking several cups of plum blossom tea, almost reaching the mood of drowning sorrows in alcohol. However, he remained depressed and could no longer sit still. He grabbed a book and ran out.</p><p>The guest room was not far from his courtyard, and Jiang Qingliang arrived shortly.</p><p>He came at the right time. The doctor had just finished diagnosing Jiang Juan and was about to leave, but Xue Fangli insisted on seeing him off personally. Thus, the poor doctor could only depart nervously with this notorious King Li.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not seem to be bothered, "Otherwise? I told you repeatedly that I was fine. You just didn't believe me."</p><p>Just looking at a book on Spring Palace Pictures made him blush and say his heart was racing so fast, scaring people to death.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, "It's none of your business."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said irritably, "No, it's not about the Spring Palace Pictures. You've been married for such a long time, King. Even if you haven't seen a pig run, shouldn't you have eaten pork?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Good question; he seemed to be right. He fell into silence.</p><p>This unusual silence made Jiang Qingliang realize something. His face paled as he asked in shock, "You really haven't?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's gaze drifted again, "Why are you asking so much?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>Regarding Prince Wang, Jiang Juan still symbolically countered, "You can't do it, but Prince Wang can." </p><p>"Shā... You still..." </p><p>Jiang Juan really didn't want to talk about this. In anger and embarrassment, he said, "F*ck, go away quickly, get lost." </p><p>Jiang Qingliang had just come over to complain to Jiang Juan, and now that his complaints were done, he didn't dare stay any longer, afraid of encountering Xue Fangli. Since Jiang Juan chased him away, he no longer provoked him. </p><p>—His Juan ge has heart disease; you can't provoke him; really, you can't provoke him. </p><p>Jiang Qingliang left dejectedly, but when the door opened again, someone was standing in front of him. </p><p>Xue Fangli had returned, and how long he had been away was unclear. He looked at Jiang Qingliang expressionlessly for a moment, then his gaze shifted downward to land on the "Spring Palace Picture Album" in his hand. </p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..." </p><p>Seeing Xue Fangli like this made his fingers tremble uncontrollably. Recalling what he had said, Jiang Qingliang's hair stood on end. He could only pray in his heart that Xue Fangli had arrived late and hadn't stayed too long. </p><p>But heaven did not grant his wish. Seeing that he still hadn't left, Jiang Juan emphasized again, "You were told Prince Wang can do it, so why haven't you gone?" </p><p>Jiang Qingliang's heart was like a dead ember. </p><p>Immediately after, Jiang Juan was also bewildered. </p><p>"Thank Your Excellency for clarifying this matter." </p><p>Xue Fangli reached out to take the album Jiang Qingliang had brought and flipped through it, saying with a smile that wasn't quite a smile, "So Your Excellency is not having a heart attack; you were just looking at Spring Palace pictures with someone." </p><p>"It really made this humble one worried for a moment."</p>
