						<p>Leaving the Prince's residence, there were continuous visitors from the palace for several days. The investiture of a crown prince was no small matter; even the Astronomical Bureau made multiple visits. On this day of rest, he thought that no one would come calling anymore. However, Manager Wang personally led two palace maidens over.</p><p>"Prince, they are from the Office of Imperial Robes and need to take some measurements for making clothes."</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed a non-committal "hm," and the two maids bowed and stepped forward. He disliked people being close to him and thus showed no expression on his face, his demeanor unusually cold. This left the two maids in a difficult situation; their hands holding the measuring tapes trembled uncontrollably for quite some time before they could move.</p><p>Xue Fangli was irritated: "Hurry up."</p><p>The maidens were almost scared to tears: "Yes, Prince."</p><p>The more anxious the maids became, the clumsier their movements. They fumbled with the measuring tape for a long while until Jiang Juan could no longer bear it. She got off the soft bed and went behind the screen, softly saying, "Let me do it."</p><p>"What does Your Highness need measured?"</p><p>"Waist, waist circumference, shoulder width, and collar size..."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and took the measuring tape from the maidens, who hurriedly retreated behind the screen. Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli and began to measure him. "Prince, raise your hand."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his hand but then lazily wrapped his arms around Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan pushed him a few times. "I am measuring you; why are you hugging me?"</p><p>"Are you going to measure?"</p><p>"Why not measure?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was puzzled. Xue Fangli glanced at him and slowly reported a measurement, "Your waist circumference."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked in surprise, "Prince, how did you know?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke in his usual calm tone, "After holding you so much, I naturally know your waist size."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He looked down at his own waist and couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. Then he glanced at Xue Fangli but still couldn't figure it out. Jiang Juan said, "I've held you many times too, yet I don't know your waist size either. You must be exaggerating."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't believe him and was about to measure himself when a slender hand grabbed the measuring tape first. This time, Xue Fangli told him, "Raise your hand."</p><p>Unlike Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan would have pulled the person into his arms if he had a chance. When Jiang Juan raised his hand as instructed, the tape wrapped around it. Jiang Juan lowered his head to check and said, "That's not right, Your Highness, they're different."</p><p>In fact, they were almost the same; there was just a slight discrepancy, but Jiang Juan insisted that they were different. Xue Fangli glanced at him and said coolly, "Take off your shirt and measure again."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>He was shocked out of his wits, raised his head suddenly, and ended up bumping his forehead against Xue Fangli's chin. Jiang Juan winced in pain and took a breath, saying, "Your Highness, you..."</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>Jiang Juan held it in for a long time before finally managing to say something. It seemed he was being pained by the collision and venting his frustration at Xue Fangli, but his voice was soft and gentle, so his anger turned into a complaint with a hint of petulance.</p><p>"His Majesty says," Xue Fangli smiled nonchalantly, "The measurements I gave you are those when you're naked."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him slowly, "Shall we measure to see how accurate this guess is?"</p><p>Silence, long silence.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with a tone of regret, "Having taken care of you for so long, yet you are still so thin. Especially your waist, it's too slim. When I hold you, I'm always afraid that the slightest force might break you. You're too hard to hold."</p><p>Jiang Juan was furious and snatched the tape from his hand, flinging it at Xue Fangli. "If you find me hard to hold, who made you do so?"</p><p>"You measure yourself, then."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned and left, leaving Weng Zongguan momentarily stunned. Gao Jingshi, looking somewhat puzzled, explained to him, "Prince Wang has angered the Princess again."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Gao Jingshi gave a warm smile and reminisced, "If this had happened at night, it would have been Prince Wang going instead of the Princess."</p><p>Weng Zongguan: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan was not amused. Unable to stay in Liangfeng Courtyard any longer, he moved to his own courtyard. Lan Ting followed him all the way, giggling secretly. Once Jiang Juan entered his room, he began examining his waist again.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Lan Ting, "Is it fine?"</p><p>Lan Ting could only shake her head and go along with Jiang Juan's statement, "Just right."</p><p>In reality, Jiang Juan was somewhat underweight.</p><p>He wasn't extremely thin but rather had well-proportioned bones and muscles, everything in its place. However, he found it difficult to add more flesh to his frame.</p><p>Inside Liangfeng Courtyard, although Jiang Juan didn't mention it out loud, he was actually curious. He asked Lan Ting, "Do you have a measuring tape?"</p><p>Lan Ting nodded and fetched the measuring tape for him. Without Prince Wang around, Jiang Juan undressed much more easily. After fumbling around and going all the way around, he looked down in surprise.</p><p>The measurements matched exactly with what Prince Wang had stated.</p><p>This time, there was no discrepancy at all.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into deep thought.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan curiously asked Lan Ting, "Lan Ting, do you think Prince Wang might have secretly measured me once while I was asleep?"</p><p>Lan Ting: "..."</p><p>She hesitated as she said, "Young Master, instead of going through all the trouble to measure your waistline, the Prince should prefer to do something else with you."</p><p>Are we undressing just to take a measurement? </p><p>This wouldn’t even be written in a storybook.</p><p>"Something else..."</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched; it seemed like Lang Ting had made some sense. Compared to measuring his waistline, the Prince would probably prefer kissing or biting him. In short, he would harass him and prevent him from sleeping properly.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan threw away the measuring tape.</p><p>He came from Fang’s courtyard. Besides feeling a little annoyed that the Prince said he couldn’t be hugged well, he hadn’t slept well. Jiang Juan lay back, intending to take another nap, but misfortune suddenly struck.</p><p>"The Princess Consort, Commander and Lord Anping have arrived," announced the high steward as he hurried over, "The Commander has something to say to you. Should I let them in?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Of course, he didn’t want to see Lord Anping. However, the Commander had comforted Jiang Juan before and helped him out of a difficult situation. After rubbing his body on the soft bed in pain for a few moments, Jiang Juan finally said softly, "Let them in."</p><p>The high steward smiled and said, "Princess Consort, please come with me."</p><p>By the time the high steward came to request Jiang Juan’s permission, Su Feiyue and Lord Anping had already been seated in the main hall. Su Feiyue appeared as usual, leisurely and composed. As for Lord Anping, he was dirty and his hair was disheveled, looking as if he hadn’t washed or groomed himself in days.</p><p>Indeed, he hadn’t washed or groomed himself in days.</p><p>"Chao Shi, come with me to leave the Prince’s Mansion and apologize to the Princess Consort."</p><p>With just one sentence, Su Feiyue sent Lord Anping’s heart into a tailspin.</p><p>These three days, he thought of many things.</p><p>In the past, Jiang Juan's constant pestering was now completely ignored by him. Additionally, his intimacy with Li Wang further added to his regret over being the Duke of Anping.</p><p>However, regret could not change anything.</p><p>No matter how much he regretted it, he would still have to apologize for his annulment and for his past neglect and coldness towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>The Duke of Anping clenched his teacup tightly. Suddenly, Su Feiyue spoke up: "Madam."</p><p>The Duke of Anping looked up as the young man and the steward entered the palace together. He was wearing a spring robe in vibrant colors; his fair skin and black hair added to his beauty, but his slightly disheveled hairstyle and a few fallen strands gave him an air of lazy charm, as if...</p><p>as if he had just been intimate with someone.</p><p>Thinking about this, the Duke of Anping tightened his grip on the teacup. In the next moment, there was a "snap," and he actually crushed the cup into pieces, the porcelain shards cutting his hand and blood trickling down.</p><p>"Your Excellency, do you need someone to treat that?"</p><p>The chief steward hesitated before speaking: "It's not serious."</p><p>He said it wasn't serious, so the chief steward remained silent. Jiang Juan did not want to bother with the Duke of Anping at all; he only glanced over when there was a sound and then looked away, not caring if he was injured.</p><p>The Duke of Anping did not even spare him an extra glance, making his mood even more oppressive.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Su Feiyue, "Charioteer, is there something you need me for?"</p><p>Su Feiyue sighed, "It's nothing major... regarding the..."</p><p>Su Feiyue looked at the Duke of Anping and spoke with regret: "The annulment was our fault. No matter what happens, we owe you an apology."</p><p>So that was it, Jiang Juan exclaimed with surprise, unsure of what to say.</p><p>"Zhào shí."</p><p>Sophie Moon shouted, and Duke of Ping'an suddenly came to his senses, equally apologetic. Three days ago, he had felt resentment and humiliation in the tavern, but now he was filled with remorse. Duke of Ping'an closed his eyes and slowly said, "Madame, I am sorry for what I have done in the past."</p><p>"I knew your intentions, yet I still trampled on your heart. Day by day, I went out for outings with...your brother, completely disregarding your feelings, and also offending you."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Duke of Ping'an bit his lips, a bitter taste rising in his heart, "I am sorry."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered her eyelashes, waiting for a while before she said to Duke of Ping'an, "I do not accept."</p><p>This shell had been replaced by another person. Jiang Juan was Jiang Juan, not the past Jiang Juan who had pined over Duke of Ping'an. Duke of Ping'an would never know that someone had bitten their tongue and died for him, choosing to apologize to him. What was the point of his apology?</p><p>Jiang Juan did not have the right to accept this apology on behalf of the person with the same name as her who had loved Duke of Ping'an, nor did she have the right to choose to forgive.</p><p>However, Duke of Ping'an misunderstood something; a glint appeared in his eyes.</p><p>If Jiang Juan accepted the apology, it would mean that he had completely let go of everything and harbored no love or hate towards Duke of Ping'an, with nothing left hanging over him. But if she did not accept...</p><p>Whether it was love or hate, she would always remember him. As long as Jiang Juan lived, there would always be a place for him in her heart.</p><p>"Alright, you do not accept, alright..."</p><p>Duke of Ping'an spoke nonsense, "Are you angry at me? If you are angry at me, I will try my best to compensate you. All the humiliation you suffered in the past and all the resentment in your heart can be vented on me...you..."</p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p>Jiang Juan grew more puzzled by the moment and couldn't help interrupting him, "What do I have to hate you for?"</p><p>"I am not angry at you," Jiang Juan said resolutely, "It's a waste of time. If I have the chance to hate you, I would rather sleep an extra hour. Besides..."</p><p>"Why should I hate you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked strangely, "Don't you know that I have a heart condition? I can't get angry, and even less so can I have any big emotional ups and downs. You aren't worth triggering my condition unless the Prince does these things."</p><p>Worthless.</p><p>He wasn't worth it.</p><p>The youth didn't even want to give him hate.</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>From the beginning, the youth had no desire for his compensation and avoided him as much as possible.</p><p>But why Li Wang?</p><p>Why was he the one?</p><p>After enduring for so many years, Li Wang acted recklessly.</p><p>Shouldering deep-seated grudges, Li Wang lived carefree and happily!</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Anping Marquis gritted his teeth at him, "Do you believe in Li Wang so much?"</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned, "If I don't believe the Prince, why would I believe you?"</p><p>The anger in Xiong's heart surged forth, Duke Ping asked him with fury: "What is it about him that made you trust him?"</p><p>"You always say King Li is a good person. Let me ask you, which good person would take someone's life just because of an insult? Which good person would casually cut off hands, gouge out eyes, and cut tongues? Which good person would recklessly hurt others when they are seized by madness? Which good person... "</p><p>"Slap —!"</p><p>Jiang Juan slapped him hard. He was furious. "Is it your business to interfere in the Prince's affairs?"</p><p>He hit too hard. Jiang Juan's fingers ached, and there were finger marks on Duke Ping's face. He stared at Jiang Juan in disbelief and gritted his teeth as he asked: "Even if he has done all these things, do you still think he is a good person?"</p><p>Perhaps because his hand hurt too much or perhaps because he was too angry, Jiang Juan's voice quivered. "I know the Prince better than you. I have lived with him day and night. Do I really need to hear from your mouth what kind of person he is?"</p><p>Duke Ping asked him: "Do you know this phrase? Still waters run deep. If King Li were as good as you say, how would the rumors about him in Jing be like?"</p><p>"He flatters you and indulges you every day, so you think he is a good person?"</p><p>Duke Ping roared: "He is a madman! A madman through and through!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was too angry. His anger caused his whole body to tremble. He wanted to raise his hand again to slap Duke Ping, but before he could do so, someone gently held his wrist and pulled him into their arms. The man patted Jiang Juan's back soothingly.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at the trembling Jiang Juan in his arms and said calmly: "Your Excellency, you say that the Prince would take someone's life just because of an insult. How many insults have you given him?"</p><p>"Today, this Prince does not want your life. It is a pity for me to have to apologize for my words."</p>
