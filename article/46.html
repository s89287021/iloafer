						<p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p>This marriage, he initially felt it unnecessary. Those three arrows were also launched as a "three arrows to determine the fate", an ominous prelude, aimed at Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked softly, "Your Highness, why are you not speaking?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression did not change, "Indeed, Your Majesty acted with intent."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He exclaimed in shock, "Your Highness, when you said you had missed the target and apologized sincerely, I believed you."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Your Majesty suffers from an incurable illness and does not wish to delay you."</p><p>Jiang Juan believed this explanation and even handed over his life without hesitation.</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, looking apologetic.</p><p>He was naturally handsome with rosy lips and white teeth. Facing Jiang Juan, he deliberately suppressed his fierce demeanor, appearing gentle and approachable. At that moment, his expression of guilt made it impossible to blame him further.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>In a way, Your Highness scaring me was also for my own good.</p><p>But I was really scared back then.</p><p>Jiang Juan had a soft heart. Seeing this, Xue Fangli raised his crimson lips slightly and said softly, "If you really care, shoot a few arrows at the king to get back all the frights you've endured. What do you say?"</p><p>He paused for a moment before saying sincerely, "You have heart disease and cannot tolerate anger; whatever the king does is acceptable as long as you don't dwell on it."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, "But I can't shoot arrows."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "The king will teach you."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head, "I don't want to learn."</p><p>Xue Fangli suggested, "Let the fifth brother shoot for you?"</p><p>At this, Jiang Juan shook his head vigorously, "No way."</p><p>What he was worried about, Xue Fangli could guess perfectly.</p><p>——Schu Congyun was quite idle; all day long he only knew how to eat, drink, and play. His archery skills were poor, unable even to hit the target. It wasn't far-fetched to think that he might actually hit someone...</p><p>After some thought, Xue Fangli suggested another name, "Jiang Qingliang?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang had practiced martial arts since childhood and was skilled in archery, but Jiang Juan still refused, "No thank you."</p><p>It seemed nothing would do. Xue Fangli looked at him without any hint of impatience, merely asking softly, "Then what do you suggest we do?"</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered her lashes, thinking deeply for a while before giving in to a rare fit of petulance, "I want some time alone."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Your Highness, I'm angry with you. Give me some space."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him a few times. Jiang Juan’s mouth was saying she was angry, but there was no sign of anger on her face. He smiled lightly and finally agreed, "Alright, Your Highness Wang, wait until you calm down."</p><p>He took a step, and Jiang Juan didn’t look back; she only lowered her head to drink the sour plum soup she had left for a while. After putting down the cup, she just happened to meet Gu Puwang’s gaze.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Gu Puwang frowned slightly and seemed unsure when he woke up. He asked Jiang Juan strangely, "Was it His Highness Wang who was speaking with you just now?"</p><p>There wasn’t much to hide, so Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah, it was Your Highness."</p><p>Gu Puwang: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him curiously, "What’s wrong?"</p><p>Gu Puwang shook his head slowly, "Nothing, I was just thinking that perhaps I hadn’t fully woken up yet."</p><p>The renowned His Highness Wang actually said things like "Your Highness is suffering from an incurable illness and doesn’t want to delay you," "How can Your Highness..." even going so far as to sincerely apologize with a gentle disposition, as if his heart had been stolen.</p><p>How could this be him not fully awake?</p><p>Gu Puwang told Jiang Juan, "Pinch me."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked bewildered and couldn’t pinch hard enough. At that moment, Jiang Qingliang stealthily climbed ashore and shouted over, so Gu Puwang raised his hand and pinched her fiercely.</p><p>"Ouch, it hurts—!"</p><p>"What are you doing, Gu Puwang!?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang jumped three feet high with a loud voice that made everyone look over. Gu Puwang looked at him and sighed, "It’s not a dream."</p><p>Xue Fangli cast several glances at him. Jiang Juan pretended to be angry on her face but didn’t actually look furious. He smiled gently before agreeing, "Alright, Your Highness Wang, I will wait until you calm down."</p><p>He took a step forward, and Jiang Juan didn’t turn back; instead, she lowered her head to drink the sour plum soup she had set aside for a while. As she placed down the cup, her eyes met Gu Puwang’s gaze.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Gu Puwang furrowed his brow slightly, unsure of when he had woken up. He asked Jiang Juan curiously, "Was it Your Highness Wang who was speaking with you just now?"</p><p>There wasn’t much to hide, so Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes, it was His Highness."</p><p>Gu Puwang: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him in puzzlement and asked, "What’s wrong?"</p><p>Gu Puwang shook his head slowly, "Nothing, I was just thinking that perhaps I hadn’t fully woken up yet."</p><p>Renowned as the Departed King, he had said things like "Your Highness is suffering from an incurable illness and doesn’t wish to delay you," "How can Your Highness..." and even sincerely apologized with a gentle demeanor, as if his heart had been taken away.</p><p>Could this really be him not fully awake?</p><p>Gu Puwang asked Jiang Juan, "Pinch me."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Confused, Jiang Juan couldn’t pinch hard enough. At that moment, Jiang Qingliang silently climbed ashore and shouted, so Gu Puwang raised his hand and pinched her firmly.</p><p>"Ouch, it hurts—!"</p><p>"What are you doing, Gu Puwang!?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang jumped several feet high with a loud shout that drew everyone’s attention. Gu Puwang looked at him and sighed, "It wasn’t a dream."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him several times. Jiang Juan’s mouth was set in an angry expression, but there was no real sign of anger on her face. He smiled lightly and finally agreed, "Alright, Your Highness Wang, I’ll wait until you calm down."</p><p>He took a step forward, and Jiang Juan didn’t turn to look back; instead, she lowered her head to sip the sour plum soup she had left for a while. As she placed the cup down, her eyes met Gu Puwang’s gaze.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Gu Puwang frowned slightly, uncertain of when he had woken up. He asked Jiang Juan with an odd expression, "Was it Your Highness Wang speaking to you just now?"</p><p>There was no point in hiding it; Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes, it was the King."</p><p>Gu Puwang: “…” </p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him curiously and asked, "What’s wrong?"</p><p>Gu Puwang shook his head slowly, "Nothing, I was just thinking that perhaps I hadn’t fully woken up yet."</p><p>Renowned as the Departed King, he had said things like, "Your Highness is suffering from an incurable illness and doesn’t wish to delay you," "How can Your Highness..." even going so far as to sincerely apologize with such a gentle disposition, it was as if his heart had been taken away.</p><p>Could this really be him not fully awake?</p><p>Gu Puwang asked Jiang Juan, "Pinch me."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Confused, she couldn’t pinch hard enough.

Gu Puwang looked at him and sighed, "It wasn’t a dream."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He cursed angrily, "Gao, are you mad?"</p><p>Gu Puwang ignored him. After Jiang Qingliang finished his tirade, he said impatiently, "Move, stop being so lazy, shoot the arrow."</p><p>Only then did Gu Puwang straighten his clothes and slowly rise. Before that, Jiang Qingliang asked Jiang Juan, "Are you going to watch?"</p><p>Gu Puwang: "He's not."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Mm, I'm not."</p><p>Jiang Juan and Gu Puwang exchanged a glance; the two salted fish shared another look of mutual understanding.</p><p>——If one can lie down, why stand up?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan, then at Gu Puwang, inexplicably feeling that these two got along well. To avoid standing out too much, Jiang Qingliang gave up trying to involve Jiang Juan and said "Oh."</p><p>"Not going, not going, wait a moment, I'll bring over Qiu Lu Bai for you. The wine is delicious."</p><p>"…Thank you?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang also left, but Jiang Juan remained seated. He finally couldn't hold back and turned to look; the prince's carriage was parked nearby, but he didn't see the prince, who should have been inside.</p><p>What was the prince doing?</p><p>He was the one who chased him away, and he was the one who was curious. After some thought, Jiang Juan said to Xia Gonggong, "Sir, can you help me send a jug of plum juice?"</p><p>Xia Gonggong was Xue Congjun's confidant and immediately agreed, "No problem, Princess, I'll send it right away."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He cursed angrily, "Gao, are you mad?"</p><p>Gu Puwang ignored him. After Jiang Qingliang finished his tirade, he said impatiently, "Move, stop loafing around; shoot the arrow."</p><p>Only then did Gu Puwang straighten his clothes and slowly rise. Before that, Jiang Qingliang asked Jiang Juan, "Are you going to watch?"</p><p>Gu Puwang: "He's not."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Mm, I'm not."</p><p>Jiang Juan and Gu Puwang exchanged a glance; the two salted fish shared another look of mutual understanding.</p><p>——If one can lie down, why stand up?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan, then at Gu Puwang, inexplicably feeling that these two got along well.

After some thought, Jiang Juan said to Xia Gonggong, "Sir, can you help me send a jug of plum juice?"</p><p>Xia Gonggong, being Xue Congjun's confidant, immediately agreed, "Of course, Princess; I'll send it right away."</p><p>"Then..."</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered a few words to him. Xia Gonggong asked in surprise, "Is that true?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes, exactly like that."</p><p>Xia Gonggong hesitated but finally said with difficulty, "...Alright, Your Slave shall do it right away."</p><p>Inside the carriage.</p><p>The guard whispered, "Young Lord, the farmer has spoken."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not even lift his head as he asked, "What did he say?"</p><p>The guard produced an object. "He said... someone instructed him to steal a wolf from a vendor, without revealing their identity. They only rewarded him with a jade pendant after it was done."</p><p>As the guard finished speaking, he respectfully presented the jade pendant. Xue Fangli lazily took it, examined it for a moment, and said with a faint smile, "My brother is indeed not very intelligent, but he is not so unintelligent to this extent."</p><p>With a clatter, he threw the jade pendant onto the low table. The fine white ram's fat jade was smooth and delicate, with a character carved on its lower right side—it was precisely the 'Hua' from the Crown Prince Xue Chaohua.</p><p>The guard lowered his head without speaking, while Xue Fangli seemed lost in thought.</p><p>The wolf blood... everywhere there were clues, yet nothing could be verified.</p><p>Every time they found a clue, not long after, those involved either met their demise or took their own lives. Today's lengthy investigation was due to the prior leak of information, essentially luring the snake out of its hole. However, it seemed as though the other party had sensed something and did not dispatch any more horses.</p><p>Thinking about this, Xue Fangli said coolly, "Continue with the investigation."</p><p>As for that jade pendant...</p><p>It seemed no matter what, he would have to find some time to visit his brother's mansion.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly, looking tired as he said, "Dismissed."</p><p>The guard bowed and just as he lifted the curtain, a eunuch with a shrill voice asked, "Is this the carriage from the Prince's Mansion? The Lady wants me to bring you some hawthorn syrup."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow and opened his eyes.</p><p>He was angry but still allowed someone to bring him hawthorn syrup. What kind of anger was this?</p><p>The harder one’s mouth, the softer their heart.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, glancing at the guard, who nodded in understanding. Just as he was about to get it for him, the eunuch said, "The Lady says that since you guards have been working hard today, she specially brought this hawthorn syrup for you."</p><p>The guard paused and instinctively asked, "What about His Highness?"</p><p>Summer Eunuch lowered his voice, "Shh, be quiet."</p><p>He frowned, repeating Jiang Juan's words exactly: "There’s no share for His Highness. The Lady said that only the guards can have it; not a drop should go to His Highness."</p><p>Guard: "……"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "……"</p><p>No matter how low he spoke, those who were meant to hear still heard clearly. After Summer Eunuch finished speaking and was about to leave, Xue Fangli called out, "Eunuch, stay a moment."</p><p>With his soft, alluring voice, he asked, but to the eunuch, it sounded like an order from death. His legs went weak, and he immediately knelt on the ground, nervously asking, "Y-Your Highness, are there any orders?"</p><p>"If you’re also thirsty, I can bring another bottle of hawthorn syrup for you."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "No need, just convey a message to him."</p><p>Summer Eunuch: "Ah? What message?"</p><p>Xue Fangli casually spoke a few words, and Grand Secretary Xia rose with a dazed expression. He was so dazed that he did not hear what had been said next; the man then casually spoke again.</p><p>"Bring in some plum blossom tea."</p><p>Grand Secretary Xia clearly stated it was for the guards to drink, not even a drop should be given to the Young Master. Xue Fangli ignored him and coldly told the guards, "If you are thirsty, there is stream water ahead, drink it yourselves."</p><p>After he finished speaking, he filled himself a cup of plum blossom tea, took a few sips, then slowly lifted the curtain. Grand Secretary Xia was just talking to Jiang Juan when she looked up.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze, lips curved in a smile; Jiang Juan slowly shook her head.</p><p>—Still angry, huh? You wait a bit more.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Not long after, the archery competition had a winner. Indeed, Jiang Qingliang won against Qiu Lu Bai. He carried a jug of wine over, and Jiang Juan did not seem to care at all.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was born into a military family and practiced martial arts since young; he had a talent for archery, even his father—General of the Flying Cavalry—acknowledged it. In the future, he would join the army and directly take an enemy general's head in battle among millions.</p><p>At present, however dazzling Jiang Qingliang’s future might be, now he was just a childish and stubborn young boy. Being together with Xue Congjun had driven the entire military world crazy.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang excitedly said, "Brother Juan, quickly taste Qiu Lu Bai."</p><p>Xue Congjun rolled his eyes at him, "Forget about Brother Juan; you should call him Your Highness!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Why don't you call him Your Highness?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "What relation do I have with Brother Juan? What relation do you have with him?"</p><p>They started quarreling. One was extremely competitive, the other couldn't stop arguing. They began fighting after a few words. Jiang Juan looked at them helplessly and only felt that it was noisy.</p><p>Gu Puwang had long been accustomed to this; he calmly pushed a cup of wine towards him and said, "Give it a try."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually spoke a few words, and Grand Secretary Xia rose with a dazed expression. He was so dazed that he did not hear the man speak again.</p><p>"Bring in some plum blossom tea," the man said.</p><p>Grand Secretary Xia clearly stated it was for the guards to drink; none of it should be given to the Young Master. Xue Fangli ignored him and coldly told the guards, "If you are thirsty, there is stream water ahead, drink it yourselves."</p><p>After finishing speaking, he filled himself a cup of plum blossom tea, took a few sips, then slowly lifted the curtain.

He was so preoccupied that he did not hear what the man said next.

Xue Fangli ignored him and coldly told the guards, "If you are thirsty, there is stream water ahead, drink it yourselves."</p><p>After he finished speaking, he filled himself a cup of plum blossom tea, took a few sips, then slowly lifted the curtain.

He carried a jug of wine over, and Jiang Juan did not seem to mind at all.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was born into a military family and practiced martial arts since young; he possessed a natural talent for archery that even his father—General of the Flying Cavalry—acknowledged it. In the future, he would join the army and directly take an enemy general's head in battle among millions.</p><p>Despite his promising future, Jiang Qingliang was now just a childish and stubborn young boy. Being together with Xue Congjun had driven the entire military world into chaos.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang excitedly said, "Brother Juan, quickly taste Qiu Lu Bai."</p><p>Xue Congjun rolled his eyes at him, "Forget about Brother Juan; you should call him Your Highness!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Why don't you call him Your Highness?"</p><p>Xue Congjun: "What relation do I have with Brother Juan? What relation do you have with him?"</p><p>They began quarreling. One was extremely competitive, the other couldn't stop arguing; they started fighting after a few words. Jiang Juan looked at them helplessly and only felt that it was noisy.</p><p>Gu Puwang had long been accustomed to this; he calmly pushed a cup of wine towards him and said, "Give it a try."</p><p>Jiang Juan had never tasted alcohol before, and he was quite curious about the Autumn Dew White. He lowered his head to sniff it lightly a few times, finding the taste refreshing with a hint of sweetness.</p><p>Gu Puwang introduced, "Autumn Dew White is brewed with morning dew. This jar of Autumn Dew White is made from the late evening dew collected on golden chrysanthemum petals during autumn. It took five years to gather enough dew to brew this small jar."</p><p>It sounded like quite a complicated process, so Jiang Juan took a small sip and tasted it carefully.</p><p>There was indeed the fragrance of osmanthus, sweet yet not cloying but rather an endless sweetness that lingered in the mouth. Combined with the freshness of the dew, it was refreshing to drink.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never tasted such good alcohol before and couldn't help pouring himself a few more cups. Gu Puwang saw him enjoying it and didn't stop him. Therefore, by the time Xue Congyun and Jiang Qingliang finished their argument, Jiang Juan was already drunk.</p><p>Xue Congyun turned around in shock, "What happened to him?"</p><p>Gu Puwang glanced over, "He got drunk."</p><p>Xue Congyun asked, "Drunk? That fast? How long has he been drinking? How much did he have?"</p><p>Gu Puwang raised his chin, gesturing for him to look. Xue Congyun looked over and saw that Jiang Juan was no longer drinking from the cup but instead hugging the pot. Thus, only he himself knew how much he had drunk.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>His heart pounded, fearing that Fifth Brother would cause trouble again, so he hurriedly tried to take the pot away from Jiang Juan. However, Jiang Juan, in a daze, still acted possessively of his drink. He gripped the pot tightly and looked up unhappily.</p><p>Jiang Juan's skin was very pale, with no hint of color. Usually spotless as an ethereal fairy, he now had rosy cheeks, his eyes moistened as if covered by a misty vapor. Just a glance at him sent shivers down Xue Congyun's spine.</p><p>Xue Congyun froze, and Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang also stood still for a moment. But in the next instant, an arm wrapped around Jiang Juan's waist, lifting him up and pressing his face into his chest.</p><p>Black-golden robes, cold expression.</p><p>Xue Congyun shuddered, "Fifth... Fifth Brother..."</p><p>Jiang Juan wriggled inside uncontrollably, but Xue Fangli was too distracted to pay attention to him. He only glanced at him coldly. Rather than seeing Jiang Juan drinking, it was their witnessing his drunk state that made him unhappy.</p><p>Xue Fanglei tossed out the line, "We’ll settle this another day," then hugged Jiang Juan. Xue Congjun gasped in fear and said helplessly, "I’m done for."</p><p>But not long after, Xue Congjun suddenly reacted with anger and shouted, "What does it matter to me? He’s drinking because of the wine you—Jiang Qingliang—brought him. If he drank too much, it was your job—Gu Puwang—to watch him. What does it matter to me? Why should I settle accounts with me?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang exchanged glances and pretended not to have heard. Gu Puwang took a sip of wine and sighed, "He truly deserves the title of the most beautiful in the world."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang agreed deeply, "Yes, he’s handsome."</p><p>Jiang Juan kept fidgeting.</p><p>After getting into the carriage, Xue Fanglei released his restraints on him. Jiang Juan lifted his head; dazed, it took him a while to recognize Xue Fanglei and said slowly, "Your Excellency, I’m still angry with you. Let go."</p><p>With that, he pushed, but being so drunk, he couldn’t move. So he looked down at the wine bottle.</p><p>He was actually carrying a jar of wine.</p><p>It was Qiulubai, very sweet. He lifted his head and said to Xue Fanglei, "Your Excellency, I stole their wine for you to drink. Taste it; it’s delicious."</p><p>Saying it was for His Excellency, but Jiang Juan couldn’t resist the smell of the wine and tasted a small sip. Wine spilled onto his pale lips without him noticing, and his hair became disheveled. He licked his own lips.</p><p>"Your Excellency, taste it."</p><p>Xue Fanglei looked down at him for a long time before snatching the jar from Jiang Juan’s hand, "You’re drunk."</p><p>Drunk people never admitted they were drunk; Jiang Juan shook his head, "I’m not drunk."</p><p>Saying that, he stretched out to grab the jar. Xue Fanglei lifted it up, and no matter how much Jiang Juan tried, he couldn’t reach it. He suddenly straddled him and sat in Xue Fanglei’s arms, full of wine, "Your Excellency, I want to drink more."</p><p>Xue Fanglei said nonchalantly, "Didn’t you say the King should taste it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said dazedly, "Then hurry up and taste it."</p><p>Xue Fanglei tossed out the line, “We’ll settle this another day,” then hugged Jiang Juan. Xue Congjun gasped in fear and said helplessly, “I’m done for.”</p><p>But not long after, Xue Congjun suddenly reacted with anger and shouted, “What does it matter to me? He’s drinking because of the wine you—Jiang Qingliang—brought him. If he drank too much, it was your job—Gu Puwang—to watch him. What does it matter to me? Why should I settle accounts with you?”</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang exchanged glances and pretended not to have heard. Gu Puwang took a sip of wine and sighed, “He truly deserves the title of the most beautiful in the world.”</p><p>Jiang Qingliang agreed deeply, “Yes, he’s handsome.”</p><p>Jiang Juan kept fidgeting.</p><p>After getting into the carriage, Xue Fanglei released his restraints on him. Jiang Juan lifted his head; dazed, it took him a while to recognize Xue Fanglei and said slowly, “Your Excellency, I’m still angry with you. Let go.”</p><p>With that, he pushed, but being so drunk, he couldn’t move. So he looked down at the wine bottle.</p><p>He was actually carrying a jar of wine.</p><p>It was Qiulubai, very sweet. He lifted his head and said to Xue Fanglei, “Your Excellency, I stole their wine for you to drink. Taste it; it’s delicious.”</p><p>Saying it was for His Excellency, but Jiang Juan couldn’t resist the smell of the wine and tasted a small sip. Wine spilled onto his pale lips without him noticing, and his hair became disheveled. He licked his own lips.</p><p>“Your Excellency, taste it.”</p><p>Xue Fanglei looked down at him for a long time before snatching the jar from Jiang Juan’s hand, “You’re drunk.”</p><p>Drunk people never admitted they were drunk; Jiang Juan shook his head, “I’m not drunk.”</p><p>Saying that, he stretched out to grab the jar. Xue Fanglei lifted it up, and no matter how much Jiang Juan tried, he couldn’t reach it. He suddenly straddled him and sat in Xue Fanglei’s arms, full of wine, “Your Excellency, I want to drink more.”</p><p>Xue Fanglei said nonchalantly, “Didn’t you say the King should taste it?”</p><p>Jiang Juan said dazedly, “Then hurry up and taste it.”</p><p>Xue Fanglei tossed off a casual remark, "We'll settle this another day," then pulled Jiang Juan into his arms. Xue Congjun gasped in fear, voice trembling, "I'm done for."</p><p>But not long after, Xue Congjun suddenly erupted with anger and shouted furiously, "What does it matter to me? He's drinking because of the wine you—Jiang Qingliang—brought him! If he drank too much, it was your responsibility—Gu Puwang—to watch over him. What does it matter to me? Why should I settle accounts with you?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang exchanged a knowing glance, then pretended not to have heard the commotion. Gu Puwang took a sip of his wine, savoring the taste, before sighing deeply, "He truly deserves the title of the most beautiful in the world."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang nodded in agreement, his voice tinged with admiration, "Yes, he’s handsome."</p><p>Jiang Juan's body continued to fidget restlessly as if trying to shake off the dizziness that clouded his mind.</p><p>After climbing into the carriage, Xue Fanglei released the restraints on Jiang Juan. With eyes still unfocused, it took Jiang Juan a moment to realize who was standing before him and he spoke slowly and hesitantly, "Your Excellency, I'm still angry with you. Let go."</p><p>With those words, Jiang Juan attempted to push Xue Fanglei away, but his efforts were futile as the alcohol clouded his movements. His gaze fell on the wine jar clutched in his hand.</p><p>To his surprise, he was actually carrying a bottle of wine.</p><p>It was Qiulubai, a sweet and fragrant liquor that filled his nostrils with its aroma. He lifted his head, determination flickering in his eyes as he looked at Xue Fanglei, "Your Excellency, I stole their wine for you to drink. Taste it; it’s delicious."</p><p>Though meant for His Excellency, Jiang Juan couldn't resist the intoxicating smell and took a small sip of the wine. The liquid spilled onto his pale lips without him noticing, causing his hair to become disheveled. He instinctively licked his own lips, savoring the sweet taste.</p><p>"Your Excellency, taste it."</p><p>Xue Fanglei's eyes scanned Jiang Juan's face for what felt like an eternity before he finally reached out and snatched the jar from Jiang Juan’s hand, "You’re drunk."</p><p>Drunk people rarely acknowledged their inebriation; instead, they often refused to accept reality. Jiang Juan shook his head vehemently, "I’m not drunk."</p><p>Before he could continue, he stretched out a hand towards the wine jar. However, Xue Fanglei lifted it up, placing it just beyond Jiang Juan's reach. With a sudden movement, Jiang Juan straddled Xue Fanglei and settled himself comfortably in his arms, eyes glistening with unshed tears as he spoke through blurred vision, "Your Excellency, I want to drink more."</p><p>Xue Fanglei responded with a nonchalant shrug, "Didn’t you say the King should taste it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's words came out muddled and unclear, his mind still clouded by alcohol, "Then hurry up and taste it."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at his lips and drank the Autumn Dew White from the pot. Jiang Juan, after a while, vaguely remembered something, and shook his arm, "Young Lord, leave me some."</p><p>Xue Fangli said with regret, "It seems to be finished."</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned, let out an "ah," and asked, "Finished?"</p><p>This time, when Jiang Juan tried to take the pot again, Xue Fangli released his grip. Jiang Juan shook a few times, really finishing it off, and he said sadly, "There's not a drop left."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, held Jiang Juan's chin, lifted his head, and slowly said, "There's still one drop."</p><p>Jiang Juan opened his eyes slowly, "Where is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with a smile, his lips red with a hint of wine. His voice was soft and slow, as if he were whispering to entice, "Find it yourself."</p><p>"I can't find it."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook the pot again; there really wasn't any left. He could only lift his head blankly, only to have his finger suddenly grabbed and lifted, placed on those red lips.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "Do you want to drink?"</p>
