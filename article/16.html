						<p>When the High Official arrived at the side mansion, Jiang Juan had not yet gone to sleep. He was leaning on the table, and Lan Ting was holding a small hand warmer to warm his hair.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't slept; the High Official heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly said, "Her Excellency, Her Excellency—!"</p><p>Jiang Juan lifted his head, his long black hair sliding off his shoulders. He asked dazedly, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Didn't Your Excellency give the Prince a sachet yesterday?" the High Official said. "There was that chaos last night; the sachet got lost, and the Prince sent me to ask for another one."</p><p>Jiang Juan certainly didn't have it anymore; this one was even given to him by Lan Ting, who had taken it off because he found the scent too strong and then put it away.</p><p>Jiang Juan truthfully replied, "I don't have it."</p><p>The High Official immediately wore a frown. Seeing his expression, Jiang Juan asked, "Is something wrong with the Prince?"</p><p>The High Official himself didn't understand why the Prince was doing this; he dared not make things up and could only force a smile. "Never mind, I'll report back to the Prince."</p><p>Saying that, the High Official hurriedly left. Jiang Juan lay back on the table without much energy and couldn't help but worry.</p><p>Why did the Prince want another sachet?</p><p>What was wrong with him?</p><p>Lan Ting dried Jiang Juan's hair and then whispered softly, "Young Master, you can go to sleep now."</p><p>Jiang Juan could have fallen asleep immediately, but he had something on his mind now. Lying on the bed, it was also very difficult for him to fall asleep.</p><p>After a long while, Jiang Juan hugged the thin quilt and sat up. Since he couldn't move easily, he asked Lan Ting, "Lan Ting, can you go see what's wrong with the Prince?"</p><p>"…Forget it."</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed; he was just a salted fish and shouldn't try so hard to operate.</p><p>High Manager returned home empty-handed, feeling quite nervous. He lowered his head and whispered, "Your Highness, the Lady said her sachet is missing..."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>A faint reply with no discernible emotion. High Manager glanced sideways to see Scholar Fangli leaning against the bed, looking weary, his dark hair contrasting with his pale skin and rosy lips, always exuding a cold elegance.</p><p>After a long while, Scholar Fangli suddenly asked High Manager, "What kind of person do you think the Lady is?"</p><p>"The Lady..."</p><p>In just a few days, High Manager's opinion of Jiang Juan had changed greatly. Knowing that the Young Master held a special attitude towards Jiang Juan, he answered cautiously, "The Lady has a pure heart and is also quite... fearless."</p><p>It seemed that one of his words pleased Scholar Fangli, for he suddenly chuckled softly, "He fears what he shouldn't fear, yet dreads what he shouldn't dread."</p><p>However, this joy lasted only an instant. After the words left his mouth, Scholar Fangli's smile faded, and he held the fine thread of the sachet, continuing, "Since her heart is pure, do you think she will come to see this Lord?"</p><p>There was only one such sachet, and Scholar Fangli naturally knew.</p><p>He had just used the request for the sachet as a way to let the young man know that someone was suffering.</p><p>If the youth did not come, it would be fine.</p><p>But if he was soft-hearted and came...</p><p>Scholar Fangli lowered his eyelids.</p><p>His words were directed at High Manager, yet they also sounded like idle chatter.</p><p>High Manager froze for a moment. A strange thought surfaced in his mind.</p><p>—So, is the Young Master simply wanting to see the Lady?</p><p>King Consort Wang was unable to move around, and Executive Affairs Manager did not think he would come. However, he hesitated before saying, "Perhaps?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond, and the pavilion fell back into a silent stillness, so quiet as to be unsettling.</p><p>"Knock knock knock."</p><p>Without warning, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>Executive Affairs Manager suddenly looked up, while Xue Fangli maintained his indifferent demeanor, seemingly uncurious about who it was until a faint voice reached their ears.</p><p>"...Your Highness."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his vermilion lips and sighed with evident satisfaction, "My little Bodhisattva has come to save me once again."</p><p>Executive Affairs Manager did not dare to respond, only standing there respectfully with his hands hanging down.</p><p>"Your Highness?"</p><p>Outside the door, Jiang Juan called out again.</p><p>Unable to get up, he could only ask a guard to bring him over. Jiang Juan was also desperate; he just wanted to lay like a carefree salt pancake, but he couldn't help being worried.</p><p>Jiang Juan came to terms with it.</p><p>After all, Your Highness had treated him kindly, and showing some concern at the end of his life was reasonable. A little business for lifelong happiness, it was worth it.</p><p>With a creak, Executive Affairs Manager opened the door. Jiang Juan did not even bother to greet him and instead frowned at Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, what is wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked up at him.</p><p>The young man's skin was very pale, a fragile, almost transparent whiteness, his eyelashes casting faint shadows beneath his eyes, blending with the light slate gray. His fatigue was evident.</p><p>He locked eyes with Xue Fangli, worry and anxiety almost spilling from his eyes.</p><p>The youth had come for him.</p><p>His gaze was filled solely with him.</p><p>It couldn't be denied that at this moment, Xue Fangli was enjoying it.</p><p>He smiled slightly without answering, merely saying in his usual tone, "Didn't you want to rest? Why are you here again?"</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli seemed to remember something and asked apologetically, "Did I have someone bring the sachet and wake you up?"</p><p>"No, I wasn't sleeping," Jiang Juan shook her head and furrowed her brows at him, asking, "What do you need the sachet for?"</p><p>"It's an old habit," Xue Fangli said casually, "Your sachet has a refreshing scent; I wanted to suppress mine."</p><p>An old habit?</p><p>Was it coughing up blood?</p><p>Jiang Juan was thinking about this when Xue Fangli suddenly started coughing lightly. He coughed rather urgently, and crimson blood traces seeped from his pale fingers.</p><p>Jiang Juan jumped in surprise, "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes slightly and said calmly, "It's nothing."</p><p>He didn't look like it was nothing at all. Jiang Juan couldn't help but say worriedly, "There's so much blood, you should let Grand Physician Sun examine you."</p><p>"It's unnecessary," Xue Fangli replied, "Whether he sees or not makes no difference."</p><p>Jiang Juan insisted, "It is necessary."</p><p>"If you're still coughing, it's not too late to bring in Doctor Sun," Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids. "Forget about the sachet if you can't get one; go back and rest."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt that he was evading him. After a moment's hesitation, since he had come this far, he asked Xue Fangli, "Can I not go back? Can you give me some of your bed?"</p><p>"You don't allow anyone to stay with you when you sleep; what if you cough up blood again and I can't notice?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't immediately respond. Jiang Juan continued, "Just a little is enough; I won't take too much... sleeping on the couch really isn't comfortable."</p><p>He had said many times that he wasn't a good person, but the young man didn't believe him. Therefore, he could only pretend to be a good person.</p><p>In reality, he was cruel and impatient, willing to use any means to achieve his goals.</p><p>He didn't cough up blood; his only illness—madness—could only be cured by the young man. However, Xue Fangli didn't mind letting the young man continue with this misconception.</p><p>Let him pity me, then.</p><p>It was the young man's own choice to be softhearted and save those in distress.</p><p>Yongning Palace.</p><p>Xue Congjun perched his legs on a grand armchair while Xia Gonggong directed people to bring over several boxes and opened them one by one. He flattered Xue Congjun, saying, "Master, how about these?"</p><p>Xue Congjun glanced through them. "No."</p><p>Xia Gonggong was taken aback, raising a pink lotus cup. "Master, is this also not suitable?"</p><p>"Since I've said no," Xue Congjun replied impatiently, "these aren't rare items; can't you choose something that country bumpkins haven't seen before?"</p><p>Xia Gonggong thought for a moment and asked him, "Master, what do you think of the coral tree the Empress Dowager bestowed upon you?"</p><p>Xue Congjun said disdainfully, "Who hasn't seen coral before."</p><p>Xia Gonggong replied, "Then... how about the golden inlaid jade bowl you requested from His Majesty?"</p><p>Xue Congjun answered, "No way!"</p><p>Xue Congjun glared at him and said, "I have so many things in my warehouse; can't you think of a few interesting ones?"</p><p>"Well, there are some," Xia Gonggong hesitated to say, "Master, you have a pair of golden cicadas jade leaves and a jade green peacock. I find these two items quite nice, but..."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Congjun also recalled them and immediately decided, "Just those two. Hurry up, fetch them for me; tomorrow morning I will take them to show that country bumpkin!"</p><p>Xia Gonggong did not move at all upon hearing this. Xue Congjun urged him, "Hurry up, what are you dilly-dallying about?"</p><p>Xia Gonggong could only remind him, "Master, have you forgotten? Young Master is about to have his birthday, and weren't these specifically kept for his birthday gift?"</p><p>Xue Congjun truly had forgotten. He complained, "Why didn't you say so earlier."</p><p>Xia Gonggong was indeed innocent, but he could only admit it, "Shall I go back to the warehouse to see if there are any similar ones?"</p><p>For Jiang Nian's birthday, Xue Congjun naturally prepared all the best treasures. After giving it some thought, he said, "Forget it, there is still a month before Nian Brother's birthday; let's put that off for now. Go fetch me those golden cicadas jade leaves and the jade green peacock."</p><p>In this vast world, he had to make that country bumpkin admit defeat first.</p><p>That damned desire to win!</p>
