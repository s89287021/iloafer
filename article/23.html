						<p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>It seemed that the Prince had misunderstood something, but explaining it would require starting from pretending to be sick again. Jiang Juan found it better to keep silent.</p><p>"Fainting for a while and then waking up..."</p><p>The sedan chair of the Wang Family was waiting at the palace gates. After getting into the sedan chair, Jiang Juan said considerately, "First go to Miaolin Temple, then take me back to my manor."</p><p>"You're going to Miaolin Temple too."</p><p>"Can I go?" Jiang Juan was startled, "Prince doesn't want me to go."</p><p>"You should be by my side," Xue Fangli said calmly, "Your health is too poor, and you are easily bullied."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to defend himself, "I didn't..."</p><p>Xue Fangli continued, "The abbot of Miaolin Temple specializes in acupuncture. You've been having chest pain these days, and you fainted today as well. Let him take a look at you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He was pretending about the chest pain.</p><p>Fainting, he was also pretending.</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled for a moment, "Isn't it unnecessary? The imperial doctors said I'm recovering well and there's no major problem."</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered lightly, "If there is a major problem, they wouldn't dare to say so. Besides—"</p><p>"You've been in pain too frequently."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a long time before slowly saying, "...Alright."</p><p>Actually, he was very nervous and sounded a level ten alarm.  </p><p>Acupuncture hurts so much.  </p><p>Jiang Juan felt very regretful. If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have pretended to have an attack of heart disease; instead, he would have faithfully copied the scriptures for a while. After all, Prince Wang would arrive soon enough.  </p><p>Wait a qīn.  </p><p>He was copying the scriptures.  </p><p>"Prince Wang," Jiang Juan said, "I copied some scriptures at Empress Dowager's place earlier, but mò didn't finish. She said it was for Yumei, would there be any problem if I didn't finish writing them?"  </p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids and looked at him thoughtfully: "What scriptures did she have you copy?"  </p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a qīn and then answered: "It seemed to be called Bìlán jīng."  </p><p>Xue Fangli smiled: "No problem."  </p><p>——The Bìlán jīng is used to suppress evil spirits. After death, one cannot go to the Western Paradise; even if one somehow escapes, one zěn would fall into the animal realm, dying an untimely death in every lifetime.  </p><p>Jiang Juan was unaware of this and treated the Bìlán jīng the same as other scriptures like the Great Compassion Mantra. The living offer blessings for the deceased to be reborn, but Empress Dowager would certainly have known.  </p><p>Worse still, having worshipped Buddha for many years, she deeply believed in karma and retribution. The Bìlán jīng is yīndú, naturally causing harm to those who copy it; that's why she specially had Jiang Juan do it.  </p><p>Jiang Juan was unaware of all this and was worried about not having finished copying.  </p><p>Xue Fangli said indifferently: "Indeed, I can't leave you alone."  </p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, "Ah?"  </p><p>Xue Fangli didn't seem to want to speak further. Jiang Juan waited for a while and then lifted the curtain to look at the scenery on the way.</p><p>Miaolin Temple is nestled in the mountains, not far from the purple wisteria sea of Beizhuang. Here, the grass and trees are lush, with yellow walls and black tiles, creating a unique atmosphere.</p><p>The carriage stopped, and Jiang Juan just released the curtain when Xue Fangli was about to lift him up again. Jiang Juan shook his head, "I'm fine."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyelids as Jiang Juan tried to squirm away, but he lost his balance and slipped from the carriage. Fortunately, a hand caught him by the waist in time.</p><p>"How can you be so weak?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said casually, pulling Jiang Juan into an embrace.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I slipped."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Mm."</p><p>He responded briefly, but it was clear that he didn't take Jiang Juan's words to heart. It seemed like he was just showing off his strength while still holding him tightly in his arms.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>At one point, he wondered if the Prince had treated him as a human pillow, otherwise, there was no way to explain why he held him so easily.</p><p>Still, he didn't even need to flip himself over like a piece of salted fish and found it somewhat amusing.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed salty air, and Xue Fangli didn't look at him. Instead, he asked: "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan reflected on himself: "Living off others' hands for food and clothes, now even walking doesn't require effort, I feel so free."</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke casually, as if there was no problem at all, and even said: "This Prince sees that you don't like being pampered too much. If you wish, it would be more comfortable for you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was very tempted but shook his head.</p><p>His end-of-life care has not yet ended. Although the Prince is severely ill, he is still alive. Now, he needs to pull himself together; he cannot rest too easily, for he still needs to conduct his business.</p><p>Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan by the hand and got out of the carriage. The High Official waited for a while before seeing them and quickly ran over, "Prince, Princess, you have finally arrived."</p><p>He paused briefly and then whispered to the Prince, "Your Highness, I seem to have seen Master Jiang Zi just now. If I did not mistake him... someone from the Military Mansion has also come..."</p><p>He interrupted Xue Fangli's speech, but the two key words—Jiang Zi and Military Mansion—made Jiang Juan alert as well.</p><p>One of his closest friends, Jiang Qingliang, was a son of the Military Mansion.</p><p>Should we run into them?</p><p>Jiang Juan's mind wandered. Xue Fangli simply replied with a nonchalant "Hmm" and stepped into Miaolin Temple.</p><p>Miaolin Temple is not a large temple, but it has many incense offerings. Given Xue Fangli's noble status, he was naturally followed by a small monk. The monk hurriedly bowed as they returned, "Your Highness, Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his head in curiosity, and the monk froze when he saw his face.</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids with an ambiguous smile, "Not enough?"</p><p>The monk's face turned red, but his heart was chilled—scared. He involuntarily shivered, "Your Highness, Your Prince... I..."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him curiously. Suddenly, a hand pressed against the back of his neck, forcing him to bury his face in Jiang Juan's chest.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>Xue Fangli acted unexpectedly, and Jiang Juan could not struggle free. He was bewildered, "What?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, his young eyelashes fluttering. His eyes were as innocent as ever, but he suppressed the unnamed agitation within him, saying gently, "There's a breeze."</p><p>Jiang Juan believed him and simply replied, "Oh."</p><p>He was pinned in his arms, unable to see anything and feeling no sense of security. He tightly clutched Xue Fangli's sleeves.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him, suddenly having a thought.</p><p>It wasn't just about wanting him to stay by his side.</p><p>He wanted more.</p><p>He wanted the youth to obediently be held in his arms, to reach out and grasp him, for the youth to endlessly soften his heart towards him with affection—and even more so, he wished for the youth—</p><p>Unintentionally, Xue Fangli remembered Little Monk Sha's look at Jiang Juan.</p><p>It was one of amazement and obsession.</p><p>Xue Fangli paused in his footsteps.</p><p>Due to inertia, Jiang Juan collided into his chest, not very painful but still a bit dazed. He lifted his head.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him intently, with moist eyes and a pure expression.</p><p>Fuzzy desires fermented deep within, yet he couldn't unravel them.</p><p>"Prince," Jiang Juan called out, about to say something when he suddenly noticed something of interest. He paused for a few seconds before continuing, "The Hall of Arhats..."</p><p>"Prince, may I go count the arhats in the Hall of Arhats? Is that okay?"</p><p>Counting arhats was a rather interesting method of divination. Inside the Hall of Arhats, there were many statues of arhats, each with an oracle slip. After counting the arhats in a specific manner, one could find answers to their desires or wishes based on the verses inscribed on the slips.</p><p>Every time Jiang Juan saw the Hall of Arhats, he enjoyed going inside to count them. He didn't do it because he had any particular desire or wish; he just found it interesting.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced sideways and, after a moment, stepped into the Bodhimanda.</p><p>"The Arhats must count themselves," Jiang Juan said, "Your Highness, you really can let me go now."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him and asked, "Which side do you want?"</p><p>"Left..."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied hesitantly, and Xue Fangli entered from the left as instructed. Seeing that he did not release his hand, Jiang Juan reluctantly gave in and said, "Then take it slow."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and took a few steps before Jiang Juan suddenly realized something and exclaimed, "Wait, I forgot an important matter."</p><p>He stopped walking, and Jiang Juan clasped his hands together, slightly lowering his head as if he were making a solemn wish.</p><p>In that moment, he seemed to be in Xue Fangli's arms but also separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, even more ethereal than clouds and mist.</p><p>An endless frustration welled up in his heart. Xue Fangli tightened his grip on his hand suddenly, causing Jiang Juan to open his eyes in confusion and ask, "Your Highness, what is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What wish did you make?"</p><p>"If there's something you want that even this king cannot give, why do you have to pray to the gods and buddhas?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and shook his head. "I didn't make a wish, I..."</p><p>Whatever it was, he refused to say more. Xue Fangli stared at him intently, dark and turbulent emotions brewing in his eyes.</p><p>He should gouge out that little monk's eyes.</p><p>He should demolish this Bodhimanda.</p><p>He paused—</p><p>"Prince."</p><p>His sleeve was gently tugged, and a young man's clear, gentle voice rang out. Xue Fangli looked at him coldly, Jiang Juan raised his hand, his fingertips just touching the prince's eyelids, then paused.</p><p>Jiang Juan worriedly said, "You have so many bloodshot veins in your eyes."</p><p>"How are you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not answer, merely staring at his hand. That gaze seemed solid, and Jiang Juan felt it was scorching hot. He couldn't help curling up, wanting to pull back, but he was held by a grip.</p><p>Xue Fangli gripped tightly and fiercely.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt pain, yet he thought the prince wouldn't intentionally hurt him, so he endured the pain and said, "Prince, are you feeling unwell again?"</p><p>He managed to endure the pain, but couldn't hold back his tears. His eyelashes were damp with moisture, and his eyes brimmed with water. Jiang Juan still asked, "Do you need rest?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him without a word.</p><p>After an indeterminate period, Xue Fangli slowly said, "No."</p><p>"Count your Bodhisattvas."</p><p>He released his hand, leaving several red marks on Jiang Juan's palm, vivid like the red plums on snow. The young man's face was still damp with moisture.</p><p>The Bodhisattva is free from joy and sorrow, let alone tears.</p><p>His little Bodhisattva, however, would cry. This little Bodhisattva feared pain and loved crying, yet only when he felt the pain, crying like a mud Bodhisattva, did it seem to be truly alive in this world.</p><p>Wanting him to feel pain, yet fearing his tears.</p><p>Wanting him to cry, yet fearing he would be in pain.</p><p>What did he really want?</p><p>Xue Fangli drooped his eyelids.</p><p>He hugged one Bodhimanda after another, and Jiang Juan looked up at him sullenly. Suddenly, he whispered softly, "Your Highness, this Bodhimanda."</p><p>"Bodhimanda of the Venerable Maitreya."</p><p>"Draw well then."</p><p>Since childhood, Jiang Juan had been told that she was a fortunate person. However, she felt that her good fortune was limited to drawing lots; she could always draw the best outcome. This time would be no exception.</p><p>Jiang Juan squinted her eyes, "Your Highness, do you want this good fortune?"</p><p>He said, "I did not make a wish earlier. I was just playing with the Bodhimandas; from now on, will anyone bully you again?"</p><p>"The Bodhimanda said there won't be."</p>
