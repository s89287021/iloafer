						<p>The entire day, Jiang Juan had been complaining of feeling unwell, but only at this moment was he truly uncomfortable.</p><p>Xue Fali stared at him for a long time, lifted his eyelids, and looked expressionlessly at Manager Wang.</p><p>"Prince, don't look at him," Jiang Juan said, "You always have your orders."</p><p>Xue Fali smiled faintly and said, "Didn't you know all along?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked dejected, "But I want to hear it from you."</p><p>Xue Fali spoke in a flat tone, "It's just those things, nothing much to say."</p><p>Not only that, not at all.</p><p>What Manager Wang knew was merely the tip of the iceberg. There were many more things that no one else knew about.</p><p>"What is there to be so uncomfortable about?"</p><p>Xue Fali's voice was carefree, "I've told you how many times, this prince doesn't care."</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly at him, "Prince, why would she do that to you?"</p><p>Why?</p><p>The woman in his memories rarely had peaceful moments and seldom gave him warmth. Only once did the woman take his hand, pull him into her arms, and say with a smile, "My Fali, the Fali my mother bore for nine months, has grown up."</p><p>"This letter is our little secret between me and my mother. Don't tell anyone, okay?"</p><p>"Don't under any circumstances tell Your Majesty."</p><p>"That was my husband. He came, he wanted to take me away..."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes behind the curtain and said calmly, "She hates this king."</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to say something more when a servant who had been sent to fetch the painting returned. She respectfully said, "Your Highness, the painting is here."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, and several other servants came forward to spread out the scrolls. There were a total of seven paintings, with six depicting one woman.</p><p>Should they all be the same person?</p><p>Jiang Juan tried her best to recognize the woman in the painting. The silk was damp and worm-eaten, severely damaged, allowing only a rough outline to be seen. Nevertheless, it did not hide the woman's extraordinary beauty.</p><p>She is——</p><p>"Your Highness, is she your concubine?"</p><p>Jiang Juan finally reacted.</p><p>No wonder Emperor Hongxing had people come to fetch the painting.</p><p>No wonder he had refused Your Highness when he was being stubborn and unreasonable.</p><p>Jiang Juan just wanted to keep Your Highness occupied while Manager Wang inquired about what was going on, but it seemed she had accidentally touched a sore spot on Your Highness.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt deeply guilty. Xue Fangli, however, asked him matter-of-factly, "Don't want to look?"</p><p>Jiang Juan opened her mouth, unsure of what to say, and could only shake her head. Xue Fangli then threw these paintings at Manager Wang and said coolly, "Take them to Father Emperor."</p><p>Manager Wang exclaimed in surprise and delight, "Yes."</p><p>Dun! The Controller, Wang Zongguan, reminded again, "Prince, there's one more painting left over there."</p><p>There were a total of seven paintings, and one had yet to be opened. The maid hurriedly said, "Controller, this painting is too severely damaged, I'm afraid it will scatter if we open it, so I didn't."</p><p>Wang Zongguan hesitated, "Prince, is this painting for you to keep or should the servant take it with us?"</p><p>A pale hand stretched out, touching the scroll lightly. Sch Fanli rubbed it a few times and said indifferently, "This painting isn't of her. Keep it."</p><p>Wang Zongguan replied, "Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down and couldn't help asking him, "Prince, what is this painting of?"</p><p>Sch Fanli laughed, "This Prince doesn't remember much either."</p><p>If he didn't remember, how would he know that the painting wasn't of Yumei?</p><p>Since the Prince was willing to keep this painting, it must have some significance.</p><p>Unfortunately, the painting was too severely damaged.</p><p>Jiang Juan got lost in thought and didn't notice Wang Zongguan leaving until his chin was lifted. Sch Fanli looked down at him and asked, "Want to take a walk?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment but still shook his head, "Forget it."</p><p>Earlier, he had wanted to go out of pure curiosity about the Prince's former palace, but since the Prince didn't have many good memories there, visiting again would probably be torture for him.</p><p>How to relieve one's worries? Only by sleeping. Whenever Jiang Juan was in a bad mood, he would sleep until dawn. He thought that the Prince could also rest now.</p><p>"Prince, are you going to sleep?"</p><p>"Do you want to sleep?"</p><p>Jiang Juan also didn't feel like sleeping. However, he thought that the Prince enjoyed hugging him, so he turned his head and said, "Mm."</p><p>He spoke slowly, "I don't like this bed, Your Highness. Would it be okay if you hold me to sleep?"</p><p>Jiang Juan felt too guilty and couldn't bear to remind himself of his own mistake. He didn't know what to do and could only proactively start the business of a human pillow, allowing the Prince to hug him one more night.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows slightly, naturally knowing why Jiang Juan had thrown himself into his arms. He was about to say something but held back in the end.</p><p>His past experiences now had only one meaning: to use them to control the young man, making him feel heartache and compassion. But he was also afraid that the young man would become too sentimental, making it troublesome to console him.</p><p>As long as the young man didn't cry, Xue Fangli would gladly accept his guilt and proactive behavior, even enjoying it.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli's voice echoed as he lifted the person in his arms and laughed contentedly.</p><p>At the same time, Manager Wang held the painting and returned to the Palace of Cultivation Heart.</p><p>To be honest, he hadn't had much hope for this visit. The Prince's heartache over Yu Meiniu was evident to all these years.</p><p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty——!"</p><p>Manager Wang entered the palace joyfully, about to present the painting when he noticed another person inside. He looked carefully and quickly bowed, "This slave greets the Crown Prince."</p><p>Crown Prince Xue Chaohua laughed and asked Manager Wang, "Eunuch, what good thing are you bringing to Father Emperor? You're smiling from ear to ear?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing was originally sipping tea when he suddenly lifted his head at the mention. The movement was so sudden that tea splashed on him, but he paid no heed, "Got it?"</p><p>Manager Wang replied cheerfully, "Your Majesty, we got it. Thank goodness for the Empress."</p><p>Empress?</p><p>Lao Wu's mother? </p><p>Xue Chaohua's smile faded, and he felt nothing but bad luck.</p><p>Why was it always that crazy person?</p><p>Emperor Hongxing's fingers trembled, his tone urgent, "Quick, bring it here for me to see."</p><p>Wang Zongguan complied, carefully unfolding the portrait.</p><p>The silk had been stored for many years and, due to improper care, had dried out, becoming thin and brittle. The image was yellowed, with numerous insect bites, and the beauty's face was indistinct. Only her grace remained as radiant as ever.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing could not help reaching out to touch it, but Wang Zongguan quickly said, "Your Majesty, the painting is severely damaged; you must be gentle."</p><p>Upon his reminder, Emperor Hongxing paused, ultimately unwilling to touch the scroll and instead gazed at the figure in the painting with a thousand tender feelings.</p><p>Judging from his expression, Xue Chaohua could guess who it was even without looking.</p><p>Yu Meiniu, that Yu Meiniu.</p><p>Lao Wu's mother.</p><p>Xue Chaohua sneered inwardly.</p><p>After a brief moment of thought, Xue Chaohua said, "Father, I heard that the master painter Yang Liusheng arrived in the capital yesterday. Not only is his painting skill excellent, but his brushwork is extraordinary, and he specializes in restoring antiques. Coincidentally, I have an appointment to visit Bahuayuan for a spring outing tomorrow, where it's said Yang Liusheng will be there as well. Why don't I take this painting with us, and if he can restore it, let him do so; if not, we can ask him to paint a new one?"</p><p>Whether restored or repainted, it would suffice as long as the appearance of the figure in the painting was clearer.</p><p>Emperor Xinghong slowly said, "Very well."</p><p>He paused for a moment, thinking about the possibility that he might not have left the palace in a long time. Emperor Xinghong then added, "Tomorrow I will go with you too."</p><p>Their father-son relationship had not improved much recently. When Xue Chaohua heard this, he was overjoyed and said, "Father is also going? In that case, I will have people close the Hundred Flowers Garden tomorrow, and only——"</p><p>"No need," Emperor Xinghong replied, "I will just go to take a look; there's no need for such a fuss."</p><p>Xue Chaohua was about to persuade him when he heard Emperor Xinghong instruct Governor Wang, "Tomorrow also call Old Fifth and his concubine."</p><p>Governor Wang responded, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>He had originally thought it would only be the two of them, but now he had to travel with Xue Fangli as well. Xue Chaohua looked sickly, feeling even more unlucky.</p><p>Emperor Xinghong did not know what he was thinking and simply mentioned Jiang Juan, recalling his promise to reward him. He smiled and said, "Old Fifth gave the painting to me, but I forgot about rewarding him."</p><p>He asked Governor Wang, "What do you think I should reward him with?"</p><p>Governor Wang thought for a moment, hesitated, and said, "Your Majesty, the Prince seems to have no particular preference, but he values his concubine very much. Perhaps we could see what she likes tomorrow?"</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong nodded. He liked Jiang Juan quite a bit; their first meeting had left a good impression on him, and this time it seemed even more interesting. Recalling Jiang Juan's behavior in the palace, Emperor Xinghong smiled and shook his head, "Old Fifth valuing him is not without reason."</p><p>Governor Wang also sighed with appreciation, "The concubine truly is a remarkable person."</p><p>After that, Emperor Xinghong realized he had forgotten something. He turned to Xue Chaohua and asked, "Elder Brother, why did you come see me? What's the matter?"</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Jiang Juan woke up groggily, suddenly jolted awake by a voice.</p><p>"Prince Wang, His Majesty plans to go for a spring outing in the Hundred Flowers Garden and would like you and Princess Consort to join him as well."</p><p>Wang Zongguan lowered his voice ﻿, finished speaking, he instinctively lifted his head.</p><p>The red wooden bed ﻿, with its snow blue silk canopy swaying gently, the fine layers of gauze still allowing a glimpse through, unable to fully conceal the bed's features. A young figure was vaguely visible, sprawled over another person ﻿. His long hair piled high on his shoulders, with one hand resting at his waist.</p><p>Pale and slender, as if stretching would tightly grasp this slim waist, or rather, this hand had been gripping for a whole night ﻿.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Spring outing."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>What to spring out on, what's so great about it? This salted fish Jiang Juan strongly resisted such large-scale outdoor activities. He sullenly said, "I don't want to go for a spring outing, I just want to sleep."</p><p>Xue Fangli then spoke softly, "Sleep if you will."</p><p>Jiang Juan claiming he had too much sleep was true; he possessed an unusual talent where not only did he never get enough sleep, but the more he slept, the more he needed. Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan buried his face back into Xue Fangli's embrace. He was still feeling drowsy and about to fall asleep again when suddenly a scene from a novel flashed through his mind.</p><p>In the story, the male protagonist also had a segment about going for a spring outing.</p><p>While being adored and pampered ﻿, he couldn't escape heartbreak either. This particular plot involved the male protagonist going out for a spring outing, where he encountered Yang Liusheng, the renowned painter known as the Sage of Danqing. The painter loved nothing more than beauties and was fond of painting them. Upon seeing the male protagonist, he immediately requested to paint him, from that point on, the male protagonist's title was no longer just the most beautiful man in the capital, his fame spread throughout the entire world ﻿.</p><p>Happiness is the protagonist's domain, while Jiang Juan doesn't want to intrude on his territory.</p><p>Lost in thought, Jiang Juan's consciousness drifted away again, falling into a sweet slumber.</p><p>"Your Highness, aren't you going out for a spring outing with Princess Consort?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's words to Jiang Juan were overheard by Wang Zongguan, who hesitated and said, "His Majesty certainly means well."</p><p>Xue Fangli indeed had no interest, but since the Hundred Flowers Garden was on their way back to the Wang Family Manor, it wouldn't hurt to go there once. Xue Fangli casually replied, "We'll go."</p><p>"And Princess Consort... will she rest?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Wang Zongguan thought that he meant for Princess Consort to stay in the palace and rest, so he hurriedly summoned a maid and said, "Be careful, take good care of Princess Consort. If he—"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "He'll go too."</p><p>Wang Zongguan: "?"</p><p>He was taken aback, but after a while, Wang Zongguan finally understood that allowing Princess Consort to rest but still taking her to the Hundred Flowers Garden made sense.</p><p>——Princess Consort had everything packed, and Your Highness carried him out of the palace, getting into the carriage.</p><p>From start to finish, Princess Consort lay in Your Highness's arms, sleeping sweetly, while Your Highness carried him all the way.</p><p>Wang Zongguan: "..."</p><p>Since Princess Consort didn't want to wake up, Your Highness kept carrying her around.</p><p>Isn't Your Highness a bit too indulgent of Princess Consort?</p><p>He was just thinking about it when Emperor Xinghong also noticed that Jiang Juan had been carried along the entire way without moving at all. He frowned and asked Guan Zongguan, "What's wrong with Old Fifth's concubine? Has her heart condition flared up again, causing her to faint?"</p><p>Guan Zongguan hesitated, thinking it over. In the end, he still wanted to save some face for Jiang Juan. "Your Majesty, the concubine is just feeling unwell."</p><p>Unwell enough that she hadn't even woken him up.</p>
