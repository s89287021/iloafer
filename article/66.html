						<p>No matter what, Xie Baileu was the toolman for the main character, and Jiang Juan was unrelated.</p><p>— He invented countless water conservancy machines and made great achievements in hydraulics. In the future, he would benefit the people of his region, all because Lord Huiyan had keen eyesight.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not give it a second thought.</p><p>He said he wanted to meet him, and not long after, Xie Baileu was led away by someone.</p><p>"Your servant has met the Princess Consort and Prince."</p><p>Xie Baileu knelt on the ground and performed his bow in accordance with regulations. Jiang Juan quickly said, "Get up quickly."</p><p>He got up, and Xie Baileu, wearing a simple cloth robe, was neatly groomed and looked rather fresh.</p><p>Such a capable person serving as a stablehand at the Imperial Stables was certainly a waste of talent. Jiang Juan recalled that there had been a brief introduction in the text about this.</p><p>— Xie Baileu was not skilled in eight-part essay writing or exam poetry, so he repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. Over time, he became disheartened and took over his father's position as a stablehand at the Imperial Stables.</p><p>"Your servant almost drowned, thank Princess Consort for saving me."</p><p>Xie Baileu spoke sincerely, and Jiang Juan shook his head awkwardly, saying, "It wasn't really me who saved you; it was the guards."</p><p>"That is incorrect, Your Excellency," Xie Baileu corrected him. "If not for you, I would already be a drowned corpse."</p><p>"There is another person in the lake, hurry and save him."</p><p>Although he was destitute, he did not want to die at that moment.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Unknown if he is Xie Baifu, Jiang Juan would have thought that even if this person were Xie Baifu, she definitely would have rescued him or someone else had it not been for herself. But these thoughts she could not share with Xie Baifu. All she could say was, "Take care in the future."</p><p>"I understand," Xie Baifu said, "Thanks to Lady Wang, I can survive. A drop of water should be returned with a gushing spring, let alone a life-saving favor. I will cherish my life and strive to repay Lady Wang someday."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>That was not what she meant.</p><p>"You don't need to repay me," Jiang Juan said, "But take good care of yourself anyway."</p><p>Hearing her say this made Xie Baifu feel even more touched and resolved to repay her. "I will take good care of myself," he promised.</p><p>Having spoken these words, Xie Baifu bowed deeply again.</p><p>At this point, Xie Baifu had verbally thanked Jiang Juan and did not wish to trouble the noble any further. He made his own exit but before leaving, took out a small wooden box from his pocket and respectfully presented it to Jiang Juan with both hands. "Lady Wang, I enjoy woodworking in my free time. This is what I made for you all night last night. Please accept it."</p><p>After all, it was a token of his heart. Jiang Juan accepted the box, which had no lid but only a handle. When she turned it slightly, it emitted a faint sound.</p><p>She said with surprise, "A music box?"</p><p>Xie Baifu did not understand what she meant, but after a moment's thought, realized that when this box turned, it would cause some copper plates to vibrate, producing a clear sound. He blushed and said shyly, "I have never named it, so Lady Wang's Music Box—what an apt name."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned the box again and found that it was not entirely like a music box; it only produced sounds but could not form a melody. However, it was already quite good, resembling an ancient version of a music box.</p><p>She played with it for some time and then shared it with Xue Fanglei. Seeing that he did not look down on this technique or show any disdain, Xie Baifu felt even more grateful.</p><p>—This Lady Wang is truly kind-hearted. And she seems less cruel than rumored to be.</p><p>Xie Baifu quietly made his exit while Jiang Juan was still playing with the little thing. Jiang Juan didn't notice when he left or when Jiang Qingliang arrived until Jiang Qingliang called out to him several times.</p><p>"Big Brother Juan! Big Brother Juan!"</p><p>Jiang Juan lifted her head and only then realized that Jiang Qingliang had handed something to her. She asked him, "What's this?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang looked at Xue Fangli and took out a card, "Dad is inviting you for dinner at our place tonight."</p><p>It turned out that General Qianji personally came to deliver the invitation, but just as he was about to visit, he was summoned by Emperor Hongxing. Jiang Qingliang happily ran errands for him, which was why he delivered the invitation.</p><p>As a dried-up fish, Jiang Juan had to lie down for several days after going out once, and she hadn't even returned to Wangfu when she received new business assignments. The workload was too heavy, so Jiang Juan wasn't particularly eager to go. She said in a resigned tone, "Your Highness, General Jiang is inviting you for dinner."</p><p>Jiang Juan deliberately crossed out her name, trying to slip away unnoticed. Xue Fangli glanced at her and naturally picked up on her reluctance. "Don't want to go?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "I'm so tired."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Qingliang quickly tried to persuade her: "Brother Juan, you can't refuse him. Dad just wants to see you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was surprised, "Ah? What for?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said uncertainly, "He mentioned that your grandfather saved his life once and had wanted to meet you before but couldn't find a suitable opportunity."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>If Shi Ma claimed that her grandfather saved him, why did this general say the same thing?</p><p>What was wrong with her grandfather? Why did it feel like he had saved so many people?</p><p>Jiang Juan felt quite puzzled and decided to go back and ask Lanting about it. However, since Jiang Qingliang had said so, Jiang Juan knew she couldn't avoid it even if she didn't want to. She said dejectedly, "Alright then."</p><p>With Xue Fangli still around, Jiang Qingliang didn't want to stay any longer either. After handing over the invitation to Jiang Juan, he left.</p><p>How could she be working during the day and still have to work at night?</p><p>She really didn't feel like working anymore.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed deeply and leaned into Xue Fangli's embrace, making a decision with no desire to live on. He needed to sleep for another long stretch. Xue Fangli looked down at him for a moment, knowing that Jiang Juan was exhausted, so he picked him up and laid him on the bed. The Prince is truly understanding of me, Jiang Juan murmured, "Your Highness, you are so kind to me. What should I do if you were no longer here?" Xue Fangli replied indifferently, "If that day ever comes, you will naturally have to keep a lifelong vigil for this prince." A lifelong vigil. Jiang Juan was taken aback. He too had planned on doing just that. To wear out the Prince and then spend his life keeping a lifelong vigil, followed by a blissful idleness. But— If the Prince really died, no one would ever hold him again, and no one would sleep with him. Jiang Juan suddenly didn't feel happy anymore. He slept unhappily and woke up to find himself in a carriage. Jiang Juan sat up dazedly, "Your Highness, where are we going?" Xue Fangli answered, "The Emperor has returned to the palace." Jiang Juan said, "Oh," and after being given a few sips of water, he started to regain consciousness. He pulled back the curtains and looked outside.</p><p>"Your Highness, zhēngmen, where are we going?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had no objections, "Alright."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and gave a few quiet orders. The carriage changed direction, and not long after, they arrived at an inn.</p><p>This inn was called "Yijian." The name was casual, but the scale was quite large, with lavish decorations.</p><p>As soon as the carriage stopped, the manager greeted them respectfully and invited them into a private room.</p><p>Calling it a private room wasn't entirely accurate; this was not a completely independent space. Facing the railing, one could look down to see the storyteller sitting on the first floor.</p><p>Jiang Juan only glanced around for a moment when Xue Fangli gave the manager a look. The screen was immediately moved, and Jiang Juan could no longer observe his surroundings. There was no way to peek outside at all.</p><p>"Your Highness, how can we listen to the storyteller now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan complained to him. Xue Fangli simply poured himself a cup of wine without lifting his head and asked, "Do you listen with your eyes?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Damn it, what lǐlùn.</p><p>Jiang Juan was speechless. He could only close his mouth. Seeing Xue Fangli drinking wine, Jiang Juan lowered his head as well. He dared not drink anymore, so he poured himself some tea and sipped it slowly.</p><p>"Your Highness, zhēngmen, where are we going?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had no objections, "Alright."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and gave a few quiet orders. The carriage changed direction, and not long after, they arrived at an inn.</p><p>This inn was called "Yijian." The name was casual, but the scale was quite large, with lavish decorations.</p><p>As soon as the carriage stopped, the manager greeted them respectfully and invited them into a private room.</p><p>Calling it a private room wasn't entirely accurate; this was not a completely independent space.

He could only close his mouth. Seeing Xue Fangli drinking wine, Jiang Juan lowered his head as well. He dared not drink anymore, so he poured himself some tea and sipped it slowly.</p><p>"Your Highness, where are we heading?"</p><p>Once he returned, he would surely be reluctant to leave again. The only solution was to prevent him from going back. Jiang Juan said honestly, "... Otherwise, he will definitely lounge in bed all day."</p><p>Jiang Juan had no objections, "Sure."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and gave some quiet instructions. The carriage took a different route, and soon enough, they arrived at an inn.</p><p>This inn was called "Yijian." The name was casual, but the establishment was quite large with luxurious decor.</p><p>As soon as the carriage stopped, the manager greeted them respectfully and invited them to a private room.</p><p>Calling it a private room wasn't entirely accurate; it wasn't a completely independent space. Facing the railing, one could look down to see the storyteller on the first floor.</p><p>Jiang Juan only glanced around briefly when Xue Fangli gave the manager a look. The screen was immediately moved, and Jiang Juan could no longer observe his surroundings. There was no way to peek outside at all.</p><p>"Your Highness, how can we listen to the storyteller now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan complained to him. Xue Fangli simply poured himself a cup of wine without looking up and asked, "Do you listen with your eyes?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Damn it, what logic is this?</p><p>Jiang Juan was speechless. He could only close his mouth. Seeing Xue Fangli drinking wine, Jiang Juan lowered his head as well. He dared not drink anymore, so he poured himself some tea and sipped it slowly.</p><p>Unknown for how long, with a bang, the clapperboard struck, and the storyteller downstairs began.</p><p>"Today we won't talk about the female hero Hua Mulan. Instead, we have another beauty to narrate."</p><p>The storyteller said, "In the former dynasty, there was a beauty who was exceptionally beautiful. How beautiful? She had already married and given birth to children. After visiting a temple for incense, she caught the emperor's eye and was taken into the palace. What bad luck!"</p><p>This opening made Jiang Juan feel a jolt of familiarity.</p><p>"Being favored by the emperor, what could she do? The beauty changed her name and surname, entered the palace, and even gave birth to an heir for the emperor. More unfortunate things happened."</p><p>The storyteller sighed deeply, "She bore a madman!"</p><p>"How mad was he? Her son wouldn't eat anything but the beauty's flesh and blood. He also kept a pack of vicious beasts, enjoying tossing people in front of them to be eaten alive and torn apart. The more they were shredded, the happier he was. That wasn't all; when he truly went insane, it became even more bloody. Calling him an evil spirit that crawled out of hell wouldn’t be too far off!"</p><p>The tavern erupted in exclamations. The storyteller paused for a moment before continuing, "Now back to the beauty. She had been abducted before she could fulfill her marital duties; any man with a shred of honor would not have endured this."</p><p>"The beauty's husband couldn't bear it," the storyteller shook his head, "He entrusted someone to send a letter to her, asking to take her away."</p><p>"Entering the palace was never what the beauty wanted. She missed her husband every day and knew he still cared about her. Naturally, she was overjoyed and agreed to go with him. However, by sheer coincidence, her mad son saw this letter."</p><p>"The beauty asked him to keep it secret, and he promised, but on that day..."</p><p>The storyteller sighed deeply again, "She waited all day for nightfall, delivered the letter, hoping her husband would come to take her away—but he didn't appear."</p><p>"What do you think happened?"</p><p>With another clap of the clapperboard, the storyteller spoke with anguish, "It was all because of her mad son—"</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>The storyteller was in mid-speech when a voice suddenly came from upstairs, sounding like that of a young man. The tavern became noisy, and his words were somewhat indistinct.</p><p>The storyteller looked up, but his view was obstructed by a screen. He didn't give it much thought, after all, there were many officials and nobles in this tavern. The storyteller politely asked him, "Sir, may I ask why you want me to stop speaking?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment: "I don't like this story; please tell another one."</p><p>Xue Fangli only gave an order to the guards before looking at Jiang Juan with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>The storyteller was taken aback and said helplessly, "Sir, if you don't like it, it's because someone does."</p><p>Jiang Juan still insisted unreasonably, "Someone likes something is their right, but since I don't like it, please switch to another story. If not, then..."</p><p>At first, Jiang Juan felt the story sounded familiar, thinking it might just be a coincidence—beauty already married and favored by the emperor, changing her name and entering the palace. However, as the storyteller continued, many details matched, clearly indicating it was more than a mere coincidence.</p><p>The beauty in the story likely referred to Yu Meiniang, while the madman was self-evident.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli with concern, who raised his wine cup and drank elegantly. Seeing Jiang Juan's gaze, he even replied leisurely, but Jiang Juan felt that the prince was unhappy.</p><p>The prince hadn't mentioned Yu Meiniang in a while, and Jiang Juan didn't want him to be overwhelmed by those painful memories again. After some thought, Jiang Juan sternly told the storyteller, "If you don't change your story, I'll throw you out."</p><p>Xue Fangli's brow furrowed as he looked at Jiang Juan slowly.</p><p>Jiang Juan met his gaze with an innocent expression.</p><p>Letting the storyteller leave was like getting rid of a prince who annoyed him. He simply wanted to send the storyteller away without any intention of harming him, but to others, it seemed more than that.</p><p>—This youth is so arrogant; sending him away means not allowing anyone else to tell stories in the tavern, taking away their livelihoods.</p><p>The storyteller also interpreted it this way and was startled. Before he could say anything, someone on the upper floor slowly spoke up: "Sir, the man only tells stories and recounts tales; what has he done wrong? If you don't like his stories, you can leave, but why prevent him from telling them?"</p><p>Duke Ping of An scolded angrily, "Your Majesty, to act so tyrannically and unreasonable is truly disgraceful!"</p><p>—He knew how to win people over.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>Lord Anping?</p><p>He recognized Lord Anping's voice, but it seemed that Lord Anping did not recognize him.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>Jiang Juan felt utterly despairing, but even in his deepest despair, he glanced at Xue Fangli and was more concerned about her. Jiang Juan said with a wry smile, "Does it concern you whether I'm right or wrong?"</p><p>Lord Anping frowned, "You—!"</p><p>"Do you know how the Emperor detests those who commit crimes under the guise of power?" Lord Anping asked, "Given that you frequent this tavern, you must be either wealthy or noble, and certainly not someone ignorant of etiquette. Have you swallowed your lessons in benevolence, righteousness, and morality?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said calmly, "I grew up in the countryside and never attended school."</p><p>That someone would so boldly claim ignorance was truly annoying to Lord Anping. After hearing him, he felt even more disgusted. "You—"</p><p>"You haven't learned benevolence, righteousness, and morality either," Jiang Juan added, "You're just insolent and arrogant. If you speak another word, I'll throw you out."</p><p>Behind a few screens in the noisy tavern, it was hard to make out the youth's voice clearly. But after hearing such a long speech, Lord Anping felt he recognized him slightly, although he did not dwell on it.</p><p>This youth, who had never attended school and was unashamed of it, could not be from an illustrious family. Lord Anping coldly introduced himself, "You have great courage to come here. I am Lord Anping. It is you who should leave!"</p><p>"Take him away from this lord!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>He could not understand, and he was also bewildered. How could Marquis of Pingan actually want to expel him? Could it be that he thought himself more noble than Marquis of Pingan!?</p><p>Jiang Juan was just about to say something when Xue Fali lowered his voice several times before finally joining the conversation. He ordered someone to move the screen and slowly began to speak.</p><p>"Marquis, you truly are impressive."</p><p>Xue Fali said lazily, "Marquis, do you know that in our princely mansion, even if my consort wants me to leave, I still have to go obediently."</p><p>"You certainly have great courage. Not only did you not leave, but you even want to expel him too."</p><p>As he finished speaking, the screen was fully moved aside. Xue Fali lifted his eyelids and coldly swept them over the room, causing everyone present to be shocked.</p><p>It was Prince Li!?</p>
