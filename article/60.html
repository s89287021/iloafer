						<p>Xue Congyun: "Do you want one?"</p><p>Is there anyone who doesn't like fluffy things?</p><p>Anyway, Jiang Juan likes them.</p><p>Jiang Juan was quite curious about the cat with four ears and said, "I want to see it."</p><p>Xue Congyun laughed mischievously, "No problem, I'll bring it over for you later."</p><p>Outside the tent, Jiang Qingliang said in confusion, "What's going on with this guy? When he should be using his brain, he acts like a fool, and when he should act foolish, he suddenly becomes smart."</p><p>"He came here to discuss serious matters, but instead, he starts by offering a cat."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang commented, "Shameful! Truly shameful!"</p><p>After that, Jiang Qingliang pretentiously patted off the dust on his clothes and said to Gu Puwang, "I'm leaving now."</p><p>Gu Puwang asked leisurely, "Where are you going?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang replied, "Just wandering around."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang had only taken a few steps when Gu Puwang said quietly, "You're heading the wrong way. The racetrack is on the other side."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang paused, changed direction obediently, but muttered under his breath, "I really am just wandering around."</p><p>Gu Puwang also commented, "Shameful! Truly shameful."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "... "</p><p>He was choked by Gu Puwang's comment and retorted indignantly, "With Xue Liu's riding skills, I'm more worried that he'll brag about bringing back a cat but fail to do so, which would be even more shameful."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Do you want one?"</p><p>Is there anyone who doesn't like fluffy things?</p><p>Anyway, Jiang Juan likes them.</p><p>Jiang Juan was quite curious about the cat with four ears and said, "I want to see it."</p><p>Xue Congyun laughed mischievously, "No problem, I'll bring it over for you later."</p><p>Outside the tent, Jiang Qingliang said in confusion, "What's going on with this guy?

I'll bring it over for you later."</p><p>Outside the tent, Jiang Qingliang expressed her bewilderment, "What on earth is going on with this guy? When he should use his brain, he acts like an idiot, and when he should act silly, he suddenly becomes smart."</p><p>"He came here to discuss serious matters, but instead, he starts by offering a cat."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang commented sarcastically, "Shameful! Truly shameful!"</p><p>After that, Jiang Qingliang pretended to brush off the dust on her clothes and said to Gu Puwang, "I'm leaving now."</p><p>Gu Puwang asked lazily, "Where are you going?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang replied nonchalantly, "Just wandering around."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang had only taken a few steps when Gu Puwang interjected quietly, "You're heading the wrong way. The racetrack is on the other side."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang paused, obediently changed direction, but mumbled to herself, "I really am just wandering around."</p><p>Gu Puwang also chimed in, "Shameful! Truly shameful."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "... "</p><p>Stung by Gu Puwang's words, Jiang Qingliang retorted indignantly, "With Xue Liu's riding skills, I'm more worried that he'll brag about bringing back a cat but fail to do so, which would be even more humiliating."</p><p>Gu Puwang glanced at him indifferently, unwilling to speak, and walked in the opposite direction of Jiang Qingliang. Jiang Qingliang curiously asked, "Where are you going?"</p><p>"Fishing."</p><p>After Sch Fanli finished talking with Emperor Hongxing, a palace attendant led him to the tent. At that moment, Sch Congyun was still chatting about the four-eared cat with Jiang Juan.</p><p>"This cat is a royal tribute," Sch Congyun said. "It's quite rare, and they consider it a sacred cat in their place."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied with an "oh." In the next second, the tent flap was lifted, and a man elegantly entered. Jiang Juan called out to him, "Prince Wang, you're back."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Jiang Juan asked again, "Prince Wang, can I keep a cat?"</p><p>Keep a cat?</p><p>Sch Fanli glanced at him. The boy's eyes were sparkling with anticipation. In the past, whenever he was looked at this way, Sch Fanli usually gave in to his wishes. This time, however, he simply said, "No."</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned, asking disappointedly, "Why not?"</p><p>Sch Fanli smiled enigmatically and said, "In our Wang Family Manor, there is one ancestor who relies on being fed by others, carried around, and staying on the bed all day. We can only accommodate one such individual."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>Damn it, he was being referred to.</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled to say, "Prince Wang, you don't have to worry about it. I'll feed it and carry it around. It will only rely on my bed. Is that acceptable?"</p><p>Sch Fanli said with a tone of regret, "Still not possible."</p><p>"The cat is too clingy."</p><p>Xue Fangli said leisurely, "How could Younger Brother Six think like that? If it weren't for you, this Wang almost forgot that I don't like these fluffy things."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>What else could he do but pick up the carpet and give a smile even more unattractive than crying, "Elder Brother Five, no problem, leave it to me."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Thanks, Younger Brother Six."</p><p>Xue Congjun shot a sympathetic glance at Jiang Juan; he didn't often see his elder brother, but every time they met, he would get in trouble. He also wondered how Jiang Juan managed to endure spending day and night with his elder brother.</p><p>Thinking about this, Xue Congjun's gaze became more determined, and he tried to convey a message through his eyes.</p><p>——The cat issue is on me!</p><p>"Elder Brother Five, I'll be leaving now."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Daring not to stay any longer, fearing that things would become even worse, Xue Congjun grabbed the carpet and ran away quickly. Jiang Juan curiously asked Xue Fangli, "Your Majesty, why don't you like fluffy things?"</p><p>"Don't you think they feel comfortable when you hold them?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said slowly, "Comfortable with you holding them?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was caught off guard and instinctively replied, "I don't know if I'd feel comfortable being held."</p><p>"Very soft and sweet."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan with a soothing tone, "Otherwise, why would this Wang not let go of it?"</p><p>Soft and sweet.</p><p>What an odd description, Jiang Juan thought as her eyelashes fluttered. Mo had a hint of panic in his eyes, "Are you making things up?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised the corner of his mouth, "Come here."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him, "What's going on?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't speak; he just stared at her. Jiang Juan thought for a moment and then walked towards him. Xue Fangli reached out and pulled her into his arms, saying slowly, "Let this king hold you."</p><p>He lowered his head, inhaling the scent of Jiang Juan's body, smiling with pleasure, "Truly soft and sweet."</p><p>Warm breaths fell upon her ears, which seemed to be enveloped in a moist mist. Jiang Juan found it very ticklish, so he covered his ears slowly and asked, "Not soft and not sweet, not at all."</p><p>"Prince, have you ever held a cat? A cat is soft, soft enough to become a puddle of fur or just one cat."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded indifferently, "Really?"</p><p>"But this king still prefers the wife's warmth."</p><p>As he spoke, Xue Fangli's arms passed through Jiang Juan's knees and lifted him up, "Let's go horseback riding."</p><p>The sudden suspension startled Jiang Juan, who hurriedly held onto Xue Fangli. His forehead pressed into his chest, instinctively rubbing against Xue Fangli several times. Xue Fangli suddenly chuckled, "This king feels like he is raising a cat."</p><p>Jiang Juan was puzzled, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, "Born delicate and with a big temper; the slightest inconvenience would make him extend his claws to scratch this king. But when he's good, he really is obedient, able to lie in this king's arms for an entire day."</p><p>Jiang Juan understood now, so he clarified seriously, "I never scratched you."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Who was the one showing a temper towards this king last night?"</p><p>Jiang Juan acted foolish, "Who is it, Your Highness Wang?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over and Jiang Juan refused to admit anything. He spoke in a soft, slow voice.</p><p>"It's probably one of this king's cats."</p><p>Riding starts from picking the horse.</p><p>Xue Fangli brought Jiang Juan to the stable, "Pick a horse you like."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't know much about horses; all he could do was choose by color. Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli to put him down, looked left and right, and then pointed at a completely black horse.</p><p>"Your Highness Wang, I like this horse."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with an "Mm," and the yard master of the imperial stables immediately brought the horse out.</p><p>After a brief familiarization, Xue Fangli mounted the horse and stretched out his hand to Jiang Juan, "Get on."</p><p>Jiang Juan cried out in surprise and asked in disappointment, "Your Highness Wang, are you taking me riding?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, "You want to ride yourself?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded honestly, "Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and said, "It's too dangerous."</p><p>Alright, if they were going to ride together, then he would fall with a pain. Jiang Juan gave his hand over and was pulled onto the horse.</p><p>This was Jiang Juan's first time riding a horse; everything seemed new to him. He touched the saddle and tugged at the reins. Xue Fangli asked him, "Are you seated comfortably?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes."</p><p>Now I'll pass this text to the senior proofreader for further refinement.</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended to be foolish, "Who is it, Your Highness Wang?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over and Jiang Juan refused to admit anything.

Xue Fangli asked him, "Are you seated comfortably?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and replied, "Yes."</p><p>Now I'll pass this refined text to the copy editor for further enhancement.</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended to be foolish, "Who is it, Your Highness Wang?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over but Jiang Juan refused to admit anything. He spoke in a soft, slow voice.</p><p>"It's probably one of this king's cats."</p><p>Riding begins with selecting the horse.</p><p>Xue Fangli led Jiang Juan to the stable and said, "Choose a horse you like."</p><p>Jiang Juan, knowing little about horses, could only choose by color.

Xue Fangli asked him, "Are you seated comfortably?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and replied, "Yes."</p><p>The next moment, the horse began to move.</p><p>Considering Jiang Juan, Xue Fangli did not let the horse gallop too fast. However, as soon as it started moving, Jiang Juan was startled and tightly grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve.</p><p>"Scared again?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly and looked down at Jiang Juan's clenched fingers.</p><p>"Why are you so scared," Jiang Juan said, "My Lord, can't you go a little faster?"</p><p>"Alright, let me go a bit faster."</p><p>He patted the horse's belly once, and the hooves kicked up, the horse galloped forward, truly as Jiang Juan wished, going faster.</p><p>But it went too fast.</p><p>On the vast grassland, the horse was racing so fast that Jiang Juan could barely see anything; all he could hear was the howling wind. He felt like he couldn't sit still and would be thrown off the horse at any moment, so he closed his eyes in panic.</p><p>Jiang Juan stopped pretending; he revealed himself, "My Lord, it's too fast, too fast, slow down a bit."</p><p>Xue Fangli said leisurely, "Didn't you want me to go faster?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. Even though he was scared, he had an excuse, "I told you to go faster, but you went a little too fast."</p><p>The next moment, the horse began to move.</p><p>Considering Jiang Juan's feelings, Xue Fangli did not let the horse gallop too quickly. However, as soon as it started moving, Jiang Juan was startled and tightly grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve.</p><p>"Scared again?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly and looked down at Jiang Juan's clenched fingers.</p><p>"Why are you so scared?" Jiang Juan asked. "My Lord, can't you go a little faster?"</p><p>"Alright, let me go a bit faster."</p><p>He patted the horse's belly once, and its hooves kicked up as it galloped forward, truly going faster as Jiang Juan had wished.</p><p>But it was too fast.</p><p>On the vast grassland, the horse was racing so quickly that Jiang Juan could barely see anything; all he could hear was the howling wind.

Even though he was scared, he had an excuse, "I told you to go faster, but you went a little too fast."</p><p>The next moment, the horse began to move.</p><p>Considering Jiang Juan's anxiety, Xue Fangli did not urge it to gallop too quickly. Nevertheless, as soon as the horse started moving, Jiang Juan was startled and tightly clung to Xue Fangli's sleeve.</p><p>"Scared again?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly and gazed down at Jiang Juan's tightly clenched fingers.</p><p>"Why are you so scared?" Jiang Juan asked, "My Lord, can't you go a little faster?"</p><p>"Alright, I'll go a bit faster."</p><p>He patted the horse's belly once, and its hooves kicked up as it galloped forward, truly speeding up as Jiang Juan had wished.</p><p>But it went too fast.</p><p>On the vast grassland, the horse raced so swiftly that Jiang Juan could barely see anything; all he could hear was the howling wind. He felt unsteady and worried about being thrown off at any moment, so he closed his eyes in panic.</p><p>Jiang Juan stopped pretending; he admitted, "My Lord, it's too fast, too fast, slow down a bit."</p><p>Xue Fangli said leisurely, "Didn't you want me to go faster?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. Despite being scared, he had an excuse, "I told you to go faster, but you went a little too fast."</p><p>"Open your eyes."</p><p>"You slow down first."</p><p>They were speaking, and the wind whistled in their ears. The horse reared up on all fours and leaped over the pond with a splash, sending water flying. In that moment of suspension, Jiang Juan's heart tightened. "Prince... "</p><p>This time, there was no response.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>One call went unanswered, two more as well, and suddenly Jiang Juan became very anxious.</p><p>More afraid of the prince not being there than of the horse's speed, he thought to himself, The horse hasn't stopped; where could the prince go? But seeing no reply from him brought a sense of unease.</p><p>There was no choice. Taking a deep breath, Jiang Juan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>He lifted his head and found that Xue Fangli was also looking down at him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan met his gaze, slowly furrowing his brow. He almost accused him: "I saw you, but you ignored me."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually replied, "Yes, I saw you, so what?"</p><p>He asked Jiang Juan, "Are you afraid?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly said, "Yeah, I'm afraid."</p><p>Xue Fangli inquired further, "Afraid of what?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...The horse runs too fast."</p><p>Xue Fangli said slowly, "No, you're not afraid of this."</p><p>"You were afraid when the horse ran fast, so you closed your eyes."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his pale red lips and spoke softly and slowly, almost as if he was coaxing, "Now that you've opened your eyes again, what are you afraid of…?"</p><p>"Or perhaps I should ask... What are you looking for…?"</p>
