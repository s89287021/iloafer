						<p>Gu Puwang was kidnapped, not rescued by some villagers, but it was Nian Ge...</p><p>Still in a daze, Gu Puwang, Jiang Qingliang spoke for him.</p><p>This incident was sensational in the capital city back then.</p><p>Gu Puwang had exceptional talent, was young and famous, and also the son of a chancellor. As a result, he was abducted under the emperor's nose, and Emperor Xinghong was furious upon learning about it, dispatching many people to assist Chancellor Gu in finding Gu Puwang.</p><p>After nearly half a week of searching, neither Gu Puwang nor the criminals could be found. His memorial tomb was even erected, yet Gu Puwang returned on his own.</p><p>He returned to the capital with Jiang Nian, who at that time was not yet the second son of the Ministry of Personnel but rather the second son of the Ministry of Rites.</p><p>The widely circulated rumor in the capital was that this young master went to visit relatives and happened to encounter the fleeing criminals and the barely alive Gu Puwang on his way back, so he personally rescued him.</p><p>Later, Jiang Qingliang became familiar with Gu Puwang and inquired about this matter. Gu Puwang did not deny it, saying that it was Jiang Nian who saved him.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was uncertain: "Did you get it wrong? Or...did Brother Nian ask your master for help?"</p><p>Lan Ting examined Gu Puwang carefully and said firmly, "I didn't get it wrong; it was this young master."</p><p>After a pause, she hesitated and asked, "Is Brother Nian the second son?"</p><p>Gu Puwang, who had not spoken all along, nodded, "He is."</p><p>Lan Ting softly exclaimed, "Ah, no, it's that your master and someone were fishing, and they noticed something suspicious about this person. They said the child was sick but didn't show any signs of worry or reveal anything."</p><p>"Your master..."</p><p>After listening to this, Jiang Qingliang was about to argue, but he remembered something.</p><p>In this matter, there was no reason for Gu Puwang to lie, and as for this servant girl—her 'master' is not Juan Ge's grandfather?</p><p>The temple experienced something, and everyone was talking about it. It turned out that this was Mr. Bai Baizhao, the grandfather of Juan Ge!</p><p>This cannot be disputed.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang immediately shut his mouth and turned to look at Gu Puwang, "Gu Puwang, what's going on here?"</p><p>Xue Congjun was also confused, but he said with conviction, "Mr. Bai would never lie."</p><p>"What..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang hesitated for a moment. Lan Ting seemed to recall something, and asked in confusion, "Why would it be the second son? Mr. Bai saved Gu Gongzi not long ago, but people from the government came to take him to Beijing, saying they needed to send him there. Mr. Bai was worried and even examined their credentials—by rights, Gu Gongzi should have gone directly to Beijing. Could something have happened along the way?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>A conjecture floated in his mind, and after a long time, Gu Puwang shook his head, "The journey back to Beijing went smoothly."</p><p>Mr. Bai saved Gu Puwang and then handed him over to the government, but when he woke up, he found himself in an abandoned temple, seeing only Jiang Nian, who told him that he had been rescued by Mr. Bai.</p><p>What exactly happened? The high fever had left Gu Puwang's memory blurred, so he could only speculate years later, but no matter how he speculated, Jiang Nian was not innocent.</p><p>Over the years, Gu Puwang was not unaware that Jiang Nian was a very ambitious person and far from harmless as he seemed. Because of this favor, Gu Puwang never spoke about it and often told himself that no matter what, his heart remained kind.</p><p>But now—</p><p>"Was it Brother Nian who pretended to be the savior?"</p><p>Gu Puwang thought of it, and Jiang Qingliang reacted too. He moved his lips, struggling internally, "How could he? Why would Brother Nian do something like this?"</p><p>Xue Congjun was also incredulous. He asked Lan Ting, "Don't you dare be making this up. Do you have any evidence?"</p><p>Lan Ting thought for a moment and said to Gu Puwang, "Sir Gu, there is a thumb-sized jade gourd in your sleeve pocket, right?"</p><p>The gourd was engraved with your name and birth year, and if I remember correctly, it was the first day of the month. Moreover... this jade gourd seemed to have been broken and glued back together.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Xue Congyun both looked at Gu Puwang, who slowly nodded his head.</p><p>"…Yes."</p><p>Xue Congyun stared wide-eyed as if he had seen a ghost, unable to say anything. Jiang Qingliang was even more stunned.</p><p>Unlike Gu Puwang's composure, in their hearts, Jiang Nian was not only good-natured but also kind and gentle towards others, so it is easy to imagine the impact of this matter on them.</p><p>"How could Brother Nian… act like this."</p><p>At this point, none of Xue Congyun, Jiang Qingliang, or Gu Puwang had any desire to be guests. They looked at each other without a word, ultimately bidding farewell to Jiang Juan.</p><p>They came noisily and left with frowns, not because they were punished, but Jiang Qingliang muttered, "It would have been better to be beaten and soaked in water than this."</p><p>"Gu Puwang, what are we supposed to do about Brother Nian?"</p><p>Xue Congyun's mood was low. He really had no idea at the moment. Good-natured Brother Nian suddenly seemed like a different person, "I feel like I don't know him anymore."</p><p>Gu Puwang said calmly, "Find a time to meet with him."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang tried to muster some energy, "Why not just go now? Now?"</p><p>Xue Congyun hurriedly replied, "No no no, he's still quite upset right now. Not today."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "Then… tomorrow?"</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Yes."</p><p>Having lived together for a year, there was bound to be some emotional connection. Jiang Qingliang gritted his teeth, "If Brother Nian is willing to admit it and properly apologize, he will still be Brother Nian. If he won't…"</p><p>If he refused, Jiang Qingliang didn't know what to do either. Just as Xue Congyun said, it felt like he didn't even recognize him anymore. Jiang Qingliang sighed.</p><p>Guo Puwang treated Jiang Nian exceptionally well, and Xue Congyun was also an emotional person. However, due to the Guo Puwang incident, Xue Congyun couldn't help but wonder if Jiang Nian's kindness had any ulterior motives.</p><p>Ping, who were usually the noisiest pair, fell into silence. Guo Puwang looked at them and said, "Okay then."</p><p>Although arranging a meeting with Jiang Nian was also giving Jiang Nian an opportunity, based on his understanding of Jiang Nian, Guo Puwang always felt that Jiang Nian wouldn't be honest with them.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Guo Puwang said, "In a few days, it will be Niange's birthday."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was taken aback. After counting the days, he said, "Sure enough, I wonder if we'll still be able to celebrate Niange's birthday with him or not."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Qingliang felt even heavier-hearted. Xue Congyun suddenly exclaimed in alarm, "What? It's so soon?"</p><p>During this period, every time he got something rare, he would immediately give it to Jiang Juan, completely forgetting about this matter. He even picked and chose among the gifts originally prepared for Jiang Nian and gave them to Jiang Juan, almost emptying his collection.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>For some reason, he suddenly felt less saddened by Niange not acknowledging him.</p><p>He really couldn't get hold of any treasures in a few days!</p><p>His mother now treated him as if he were a thief!</p><p>"Grandpa, you're truly... kind-hearted."</p><p>"Mister isn't kind-hearted either; he..." Lanting paused to choose his words, looking oddly and said, "Mister's one visit counts as... fishing, and he managed to catch someone too."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>This is ridiculous.</p><p>Was this the reason why his grandfather saved so many people?</p><p>However, since the topic was brought up, Jiang Juan said curiously, "Prime Minister Gu mentioned that Grandfather saved Gu Puwang. It should be this time. Since Prime Minister Gu knows about it, how could Gu Puwang not know?"</p><p>Lanting pondered for a moment and said, "I remember about half a year later, someone from the mountains came to the capital. Master was quite fond of Young Master Gu, so he entrusted him with a letter to deliver. It was at this time that Prime Minister Gu probably found out."</p><p>"After such a long time and after Young Master Gu went through hardships, Prime Minister Gu likely thought it unnecessary to inform Young Master Gu again."</p><p>She spoke very reasonably, and Jiang Juan was convinced.</p><p>Jiang Juan had already eaten breakfast and met her guests, but the Prince still hadn't returned. In the past, he could play with toys like the nine-link ring or Lu Ban lock, but now he didn't even have anything to do with his time. Jiang Juan said idly, "Let's take another nap."</p><p>"Young Master, you..."</p><p>Jiang Juan was always a heavy sleeper. Upon hearing this, Lanting was about to tease him, but suddenly she remembered Anan's words about being unsettled and her heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to change the subject, "Since you've just finished your meal, Young Master, please don't rush to sleep yet."</p><p>"But if I don't sleep, there's nothing else to do."</p><p>"Well, how about..."</p><p>Lanting suggested, "I can bring you the cat that I brought back from the manor to play with?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, and this sounded good. "Okay, hurry up and bring it over."</p><p>Soon, the long meow of the kitten echoed as Lanting walked in quickly with a four-legged cat.</p><p>The kitten grew fast. It came to the mansion and was well-fed, but surprisingly, it had gained weight. Lanting placed it in Jiang Juan's arms, "Young Master, hold it steady."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and reached out, randomly feeling around. The kitten was quite affectionate, constantly rubbing its head against Jiang Juan's fingers. Jiang Juan lowered his head and took a deep breath.</p><p>Ah, what joy.</p><p>When Xue Fangli entered the Cool Breeze Courtyard, Jiang Juan was happily petting the cat, burying his entire face in it. Xue Fangli lifted his robe and walked in, pinching Jiang Juan's nape, "Didn't I tell you not to do this?"</p><p>"Your Highness."</p><p>Hearing his voice, Jiang Juan felt quite happy, but when His Highness came to reprimand him, he could only ask blankly, "What did you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "You can keep a cat in the mansion, but you can't hold it, and definitely not let it on the bed."</p><p>Hmm, that does sound familiar.</p><p>His Highness doesn't like furry animals.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit guilty, but the feeling of the kitten's soft fur was so nice that he didn't want to put it down. Jiang Juan struggled, "Can I hold it for a moment? I'll take a bath later."</p><p>"No."</p><p>But Jiang Juan really wanted to play with the cat, and he reached out to grab Xue Fangli's fingers, "Just a moment."</p><p>Xue Fangli brushed away Jiang Juan's hand, and Jiang Juan grabbed again, "Your Highness, let me kiss you. You told me I could hold the cat."</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was quite blunt, "You're all covered in cat fur; what's there to kiss?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What does he mean by all covered in cat fur? His Highness is really annoying.</p><p>Now that they were no longer kissing, Jiang Juan didn't even want to touch his hand anymore, "I'm telling you, having a big mouth just gets on my nerves. You're the number one irritant."</p><p>Jiang Juan was clearly annoyed, not only holding the kitten even tighter but also asking Lanting to help him get into bed. Jiang Juan solemnly said, "Your Highness, I accidentally covered your bed with cat hair tonight. You'd better sleep somewhere else."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him. The young man lay on the bed, placing the kitten on his chest. The kitten patted all over his body, and his shirt was soon torn open. His disheveled black hair stuck to his neck, falling onto his beautiful collarbones and porcelain-like skin.</p><p>"Tsk."</p><p>Xue Fangli walked over, his slender fingers tapping lightly on the kitten's head. The little animal was exceptionally sensitive to danger and instinctively sensed a threat, immediately freezing in place. Xue Fangli then lowered his head, about to kiss him.</p><p>Jiang Juan seemed to sense something and quickly pressed his hand down, still holding a grudge against him, "Your mouth is full of cat hair, what are you going to kiss?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and wrapped Jiang Juan in his arms, resting his chin on Jiang Juan's shoulder, inhaling his scent, and said casually, "Kiss you."</p><p>"No. I've changed my mind. It's not happening."</p><p>Jiang Juan was angry but only forbade him from kissing; he didn't ignore him entirely. He continued to pet the cat for a while and asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, what do you think we should name it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied without hesitation, "Jiang Qin."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>"What's this Jiang Qin? That won't work," Jiang Juan said, "Are you calling me lazy?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't believe him at all. He was determined to retort, "How about Schrodger then?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>He had no interest in what the cat would be named and wasn't bothered by Jiang Juan's insults either, so he lazily replied, "Whatever you say."</p><p>A well-behaved cat, zěnme jiào le gǒu, Lán Ting looked rather at a loss for words. The ones being scolded didn't have any objections, so she could only smile and shake her head.</p><p>His Highness is truly spoiling his young master.</p><p>Qǐngwén jīntiān, servants rushed in and whispered something to the chief eunuch. The chief eunuch hurriedly said, "Your Highness, it's time."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his head and responded with a "hum." Jiang Juan curiously asked him, "Where are you going?"</p><p>"To the study; there's something."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing's illness had been severe, and he found it increasingly difficult to handle state affairs. As a result, many matters were piling up.</p><p>Originally, the young master should have moved into the Eastern Palace to take charge of governance. However, since the young master was busy with his duties and Jiang Juan was handling everything else, he naturally had no time for these matters. Now that Jiang Juan had woken up, everything should get back on track.</p><p>Earlier, someone from the palace had come. It turned out to be an edict from Emperor Hongxing. He then sent people over to have them first get acquainted with Xue Fangli and handle some difficult memos.</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't need to return to Liangfeng Courtyard; it was Jiang Juan who said she was afraid that he returned, just to soothe her.</p><p>When he really came back, there was no sign of fear in the young man.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head. Jiang Juan was holding a kitten and playing with its claws, having great fun. Xue Fangli pinched the soft flesh on his face calmly and said, "Let's go. When we come back, if the cat is still here..."</p><p>"Then it comes too."</p><p>He didn't even finish warning her when Jiang Juan put down the kitten. She hugged Xue Fangli's waist and said, "Prince, you'll get bored being alone, bring him along."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still thinking about what the chief eunuch had mentioned about the interrogation.</p><p>The prince said he was going to the study and that there was something to do. Jiang Juan immediately became cautious. Last night, he used the same line of reasoning, so Jiang Juan subconsciously thought he wanted to interrogate Li Shilang.</p><p>"You?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan, and it wasn't really unacceptable. Having the person by his side meant he didn't have to constantly worry about what kind of trouble he might get into or if he had hurt himself again.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Hmm, I want..."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Play with your cat."</p><p>It seemed as though Xue Fangli truly did not want Jiang Juan to stay with the cat. He put Jiang Juan back on the bed and stood up, "Stay here well."</p><p>Jiang Juan reached out to grab him, "I don't want to play with the cat anymore, My Lord, I want to be with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli gave a derisive snort but showed no reaction. Jiang Juan slowly said, "Do you want me to kiss you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and smiled, "This Wang does not feel like kissing right now."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained, "...Why are you so out of place?"</p><p>"Then what do you actually want?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head. The youth's shirt, which had been scattered by the cat, was still disheveled. On his shoulder and neck, besides a dark red mole, there were also numerous pinkish bite marks.</p><p>His lips curled into a smile, Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan's chin and said in a deep, pleasant voice, "This Wang will teach you something new tonight... how about it?"</p><p>"Okay, okay."</p><p>It didn't matter what kind of game or what they played; Jiang Juan didn't really care. As long as the Lord was willing to take him along, allowing him to prove himself and not feel overly lenient, he would be satisfied. "My Lord, carry me."</p><p>Xue Fangli fixed Jiang Juan's clothes and then did as he wished, pulling Jiang Juan back into his arms and hugging him.</p><p>Guan Shishang waited anxiously outside but dared not urge them on, after all, the important person had arrived. They had been waiting for His Highness for a long time.</p><p>As for the reason...</p><p>Guan Shishai glanced at the person in Xue Fang's arms, who was not yet Zifei and was very affectionate. Prince, you dote on her so much.</p><p>Whether she becomes a queen or Zifei, this lady is truly——</p><p>A demoness!</p>
