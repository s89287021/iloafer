						<p>Jiang Juan was still waiting for him to look at the painting when, &#58444;&#8204;she seemed momentarily stunned. However, she quickly responded, "I don’t think it’s good."</p><p>Though she said it wasn’t good, Jiang Juan’s face still bore a hint of a smile as her eyelashes fluttered, casting shadows that were mesmerizing.</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, and his expression darkened for an instant. But it was only a momentary change; he then smiled and asked Jiang Juan leisurely, "Why isn’t it good?"</p><p>His tone was gentle, and his smile warm, but there was an extremely dangerous aura that permeated his entire being.</p><p>Jiang Juan’s dullness to sensing the atmosphere was confirmed at this moment. She said slowly, "Last time, when I made the prince care about something, he refused. So now, it won’t work either."</p><p>"…… It also depends on how you present it."</p><p>His last mention was about Miaolin Temple, where Jiang Juan had talked about some matters concerning the prince and his concubine to prevent the prince from being swayed by the past and make him care only for her in the future.</p><p>But the prince had refused her.</p><p>"Well."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled again, with his crimson lips slightly curled in a regretful yet indifferent smile.</p><p>Whether she agreed or not, Xue Fangli already knew the answer when he asked.</p><p>Regardless of what the youth thought, he just needed one answer.</p><p>Asking Jiang Juan was merely to show that he was a "good person."</p><p>The only regret was that if the youth had been more obedient and given a slightly different answer, it might have pleased him, and he would have been more patient.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, seeing Jiang Juan ask him, "Prince, what’s wrong with you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Huh?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said gloomily, "Wǒu? Shuō bùxíng, nǐ jiù bùwèn yī biàn ma? Wànyī gǎi le zhǔyì ne?"</p><p>Tā bù wèn, Jiang Juan could only jìnshì tā: "Nǐ jujue guò yī ci, tā yě jujuele nǐ yī ci, xiànzài men chěng píng le, Wáng Yé, juédé nǐ kěyǐ bùwèn yī biàn le."</p><p>Xue Fangli zhēng, yòuyǒu yī shù yānhuā zúrán shēngkōng, liúguang duòluò, càn làng é qǔ dàng, Jiang Juan yǎngtóu kàn yānhuā, tā qínshì jiàng Juan.</p><p>Páiqiǎo hòu, Xue Fangli dīdī xiào le, nèixīn de yīnzhēng yī shā é kōng, tā xíyuè de, qīngsōng de xiào le.</p><p>Jiang Juan niántóu wènta: "Wáng Yé, nǐ xiào shénme?"</p><p>Xue Fangli wàngxiàng huàjuǎn, "Yì fú huà... nǐ dǎkāi kàn guò méiyǒu?"</p><p>Jiang Juan yáo le xià tóu, Xue Fangli jiàn zhuàng, zài tā miànqián huǎnhuǎn zhǎngkāi huàjuǎn.</p><p>Huǒ shù yín huā bùyè.</p><p>Tāmen zài kàn yānhuā, huà de yě shì yānhuā.</p><p>Jiang Juan bù néng bānjī: "Hǎo qiào."</p><p>Xue Fangli nǐndǐněi, "Shì a."</p><p>Nà xiē nián de shì, tā wèimò yī sī yī háomáo, yí diǎn yī dī, tā xué dān qīng, shì wèi quèyuè nà gè nǚrén, tā wèi tā huà le yī fú yòu yī fú huàxiàng, yě shì wèi quèyuè tā.</p><p>Yīn Wéihóng Xīng Dì de sānkě qǐu.</p><p>— "Nǐ shì tā gǔròu, nǐ lái jiù shì tā wéiyí de qiānbàn.

That woman died on Qixi. That night, white mourning clothes fluttered in the palace, while outside, there were dazzling fireworks. Xue Fangli picked up his brush and drew a painting.</p><p>His ethereal and utterly loathsome person finally had a moment to exist for himself, only to fall back into endless hatred.</p><p>Seven years later, there was such a young man who wanted to stay with him.</p><p>What he once hated and despised softened the youth’s heart and made him love him more. He began to feel fortunate to have enough suffering to manipulate the youth day by day, making him stay by his side.</p><p>He should have sunk into endless hatred and loathing, but a hand reached out to him, bringing him back to humanity.</p><p>That was his little Bodhisattva, who delivered him from the sea of suffering.</p><p>"Since that is the case, this King can only ask you once more," Xue Fangli said with a smile, "From now on, I care only about you. What do you think?"</p><p>"You care, then," Jiang Juan was unusually honest for once as he spoke seriously, "Your Highness could care even more."</p><p>"You are in such poor health, either suffering from headaches or coughing blood. If you cared more, perhaps you could live a bit longer, and I wouldn’t have to send you off so soon.”</p><p>Xue Fangli: “...”</p><p>He paused for a moment, sizing Jiang Juan up. The youth not only spoke seriously but also looked incredibly serious as if he truly believed that Xue Fangli would die before him and needed to take care of sending him off.</p><p>After a brief silence, Xue Fangli said nothing but smiled slightly, "Alright, I will try to stay longer. As for you, your illness is so frequent; you must endure for a bit longer."</p><p>Xue Fangli could not keep him long. On that day, he would personally send the youth off, but he did not want to do it too soon.</p><p>The two stared at each other for a long time before Jiang Juan sighed softly.</p><p>— Alas, how severe is your illness? Even if Your Highness stays longer, how much longer can you stay?</p><p>Xue Fangli also lowered his eyelids, his expression lost in thought.</p><p>— The attacks of his heart condition were so frequent. How long could the youth endure?</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The fireworks shot into the sky, sparks bursting in the air, and the loud noise made Xue Jun's hand tremble slightly. He almost lost grip on his teacup, spilling hot tea out.</p><p>"Why did His Majesty let the fireworks last for so long?"</p><p>Xue Jun was puzzled; tonight's display of fireworks had gone on too long, causing a constant buzzing in his ears.</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled and said across from him, "I suppose His Majesty felt rather well today, so he instructed them to keep it going longer."</p><p>During the day, Xue Jun hadn't gone out for a spring outing. Instead, he had made plans with Jiang Nian and a few others to have dinner at Pavilion of Gathering Sages that evening. However, Jiang Qingliang and Duke of Anping both had matters to attend to, so only Xue Jun, Jiang Nian, and Gu Puwang were present.</p><p>Xue Jun sighed, "If it weren't for the fireworks, I would certainly be much quieter without Ms. Jiang's constant chatter."</p><p>Jiang Nian took a sip of tea and smiled helplessly. Suddenly remembering something, he apologized to Gu Puwang with a slight sense of guilt, "By the way, I'm afraid we won't be able to attend tomorrow's archery competition between the Freeheart Hall and Guangye Hall."</p><p>Both the Freeheart Hall and the Guangye Hall were one of the six halls within the National Academy. The Freeheart Hall was led by Gu Puwang, while the Guangye Hall was headed by Jiang Qingliang. As their relationship was quite amiable, they often interacted frequently. A while ago, they had discussed organizing an archery competition, during which Jiang Qingliang had invited Jiang Nian to join in.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang being absent, Gu Puwang simply took a sip of tea and said coolly, "It's fine if you can't come. We'll manage."</p><p>Both Gu Puwang and Jiang Qingliang were students at the National Academy. After all, one was the son of the Chancellor, and the other the son of a General. Xue Jun, being an emperor-to-be, had to attend classes in the Great Hall diligently without any companions to accompany him, making each day extremely boring.</p><p>Thinking about it for a moment, Xue Jun enthusiastically said, "Since Brother Nian can't make it tomorrow, I'll come watch your competition."</p><p>Gu Puwang replied coldly, "You don't need to. Jiang Qingliang is quite talkative on his own; the two of you together will be unbearable."</p><p>Xue Jun's mood immediately darkened, and he lunged over to pinch him, "Since His Majesty graces us with his presence, not even bowing in welcome is acceptable, let alone disliking it. Damn it, rephrase that sentence for me."</p><p>Gu Puwang pushed away his hand, feeling too lazy to explain further. He merely adjusted his clothes and, as Xue Jun continued to insult him, suddenly noticed a group of scholars at the neighboring table discussing Jiang Nian.</p><p>"Have any of you heard that today in the Hundred Flowers Garden, the first place among our capital's top artists has changed hands?"</p><p>"Changed hands? Who took over?"</p><p>"You all guess."</p><p>He suddenly brought up the topic without giving any hints, so no one could guess correctly. After a few names were suggested and then dismissed, everyone urged him to hurry up and tell them, as the famous books were still on sale, "You don't know how gentle and proper Scholar Second is, he's known as the Little Immortal. In front of this person, he's nothing at all. Willows said—"</p><p>"Scholar Second! He's like a firefly's light, whereas that person is like the moon's radiance. Scholar Second is nothing in front of him!"</p><p>Jiang Nian's finger trembled, and his teacup fell with a thud.</p><p>He had expected news about the Hundred Flowers Garden to spread throughout the capital soon, but hearing it firsthand still made his heart feel uneasy. However, he couldn't show any displeasure here because—</p><p>Xue Jun asked cautiously. Jiang Nian shook his head and forced a smile, "I'm fine."</p><p>He didn't look fine at all. Xue Jun was very worried and wanted to console him but didn't know what to say, while the group of book enthusiasts continued chatting excitedly.</p><p>"Really? Is that true?"</p><p>"Don't you know who Willows is? He's a renowned master painter, and even the most talented artists only paint people. Can we doubt his words?"</p><p>Amidst gasps of astonishment, someone suddenly said, "Speaking of which, it was my first time meeting Scholar Second, and I wondered how he could be the capital's top artist. That face isn't particularly attractive; still, Marquis Hou and Emperor Six both praised him excessively, so I had to go along with everyone else."</p><p>"Brother Wang, you think so too? To be honest, I thought the same thing!"</p><p>"You two think so as well? I thought it was just one person's poor taste and low-level appreciation. It turns out it wasn't just one person?"</p><p>No one knew who "Hao Yue" was, but a group had already agreed on it. People usually tacitly accepted that Scholar Second of the Ministry of Personnel was the top artist, praising him without reservation. Today, they discovered that everyone actually had their doubts—</p><p>His face didn't seem particularly handsome.</p><p>His demeanor was decent, but not outstanding.</p><p>As for the so-called bone structure, it was even more elusive.</p><p>The two officials from the Ministry of Revenue had nothing to do with ordinary people in the first place, and yet they insisted on talking about bone structure. Honestly speaking, whether it's bone structure or appearance, there must be something that can be seen; one cannot say that if one aspect is unattractive, another can be forcibly attributed as a positive?</p><p>"So, who is the current number one?"</p><p>Someone couldn't help but ask out loud. At the same time, Xue Jun slammed his chopsticks down on the table and said to Jiang Nian, "Nian Ge, go over there."</p><p>Jiang Nian's face turned pale, and his voice was tenderly soothing, "What are you going over for? Is it because of...? Let them talk; ...it doesn't matter."</p><p>Xue Jun looked at him and still stood up, "Let's see... let's see. Nian Ge, you're not the number one, so who is? Are they truly worthy of the title of 'number one'?"</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly tried to reach out to stop her but couldn't. Xue Jun rushed over with a fierce momentum, and Jiang Nian frowned at her retreating back, his gaze flickering.</p><p>He had spared no effort and flattered them extensively, not just for the title of "Nian Ge." They served their purpose well, like a fleeting moment.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jiang Nian curled his lips. He slowly withdrew his gaze but then unexpectedly met Gu Puwang's eyes, making his heart tremble.</p><p>He got along with Xue Jun, Jiang Qingliang, and Gu Puwang. Among the three, he had invested the most effort in Gu Puwang, yet it was precisely Gu Puwang who often made him feel defeated—he was too discerning, as if they were friends but he couldn't open up to him. Sometimes Jiang Nian even felt that Gu Puwang could see right through him.</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled at Gu Puwang, who didn't say anything and only looked at the provocative Xue Jun as she walked over to the table of scholars.</p><p>"Hey, you guys——"</p><p>"The current number one is Wang Xin's newly married wife, who is also the third official from the Ministry of Revenue!"</p><p>Xue Jun: "..."</p><p>They both spoke at the same time, his hand almost reaching out to touch the speaker's shoulder but then froze mid-air.</p><p>Why was it him?</p><p>Clown—no, now he's known as Juan. He does cry a lot, but he is actually quite handsome.</p><p>any major issue?</p><p>It felt rather fitting.</p><p>Xue Jun fell silent.</p><p>The person who had been talking the most suddenly came with someone else. The companion saw them and his eyes widened in shock, frantically signaling at Shu. Shu, receiving these signals, turned around curiously and nearly tumbled off the chair.</p><p>Six Huang!</p><p>It was actually Six Huang!</p><p>Who would have thought he was friends with Second Gong!</p><p>"Si-xiuhuang..."</p><p>Thinking of all the bad things she had said about Jiang Nian, Shu called out hesitantly, afraid Xue Jun would punish her. But Xue Jun didn't say anything; he just stared at her, creating an incredibly eerie atmosphere.</p><p>After a long moment, Xue Jun lowered his hand from the air and offered a embarrassed yet polite smile, "I made a mistake. Goodbye."</p><p>And then—</p><p>he left.</p><p>"???"</p><p>What? Didn't he come to support Lord Jianggong?</p><p>Shu:184:, who had narrowly escaped, looked bewildered. Jiang Nian was even more astonished, recalling Xue:58930:'s character—always fiery and extravagant. In the past, she would have flipped Shu:184:'s table already.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his hands, suddenly feeling uneasy. He asked without showing it, "You've changed your ways today, haven't you? Still worried?"</p><p>Xue:58930: was somewhat guilty. He dared not tell Jiang Nian the truth, thinking Jiang Juan was a good match for First Prince Li. So he whispered, "Brother Fifth is too terrifying. As his concubine, I can't speak up."</p><p>Jiang Nian was stunned. Indeed, with King Li's protection of Jiang Juan, Xue:58930: couldn't avoid interacting with them. If this reached King Li's ears, Xue:58930: would surely be in trouble.</p><p>Originally thinking that Xue:58930: would have an outburst today, his words might calm down somewhat, but he had misjudged the situation. Jiang Nian couldn't say much and could only smile gently, "Well, you're fine now, so you won't be scolded by His Majesty when you return to the palace."</p><p>Xue:58930: waved his hand and picked up his teacup to drink. Thinking of the words about the moonlight's brilliance and firefly's glow, Jiang Nian was quite depressed. He wasn't truly indifferent either; he said softly, "Go out for some fresh air."</p><p>Jiang Nian stood up. After he left, Gu Puwang looked intently at Xue:58930: and slowly asked, "What's going on between you and Concubine Li?"</p><p>Gu Puwang was like that, with eyes sharp enough to catch any hint. Xue:58930:, lying down on the table, whispered to him, "I once caused trouble for him, but later I thought..."</p><p>Xue:58930: scratched his head and asked Gu Puwang, "Have you seen him? Anyway, I think there might be a misunderstanding between him and Brother Nian. He doesn't seem like the kind of person who would push Brother Nian into the lake."</p><p>Gu Puwang pondered for a moment. He had little impression of Concubine Li and only heard occasional mentions from Jiang Nian. Gu Puwang shook his head, "No."</p><p>As for whether there was any misunderstanding between them, Gu Puwang was even less certain. He only reminded Xue:58930:, "Don't ask Brother Nian about misunderstandings."</p><p>Xue:58930: looked bewildered, "Why not?"</p><p>Gu Puwang didn't answer.</p><p>His nature was rather aloof and not as foolish as Xue:58930: and Jiang Qingliang. Therefore, he somewhat knew that Jiang Nian wasn't as gentle and indifferent as he appeared.</p><p>Jiang Nian esteemed this person for his ambition and cunning. Since he had mentioned Jiang Juan to them, it was clear that he did not like Jiang Juan.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Gu Puwang continued, "Time reveals the true nature of a person. You have only met Princess Li Wangfei a few times, whereas you have lived with Nian Ge for years. Why are you so sure about him?"</p><p>Xue Jun said, "Well, he... sigh, I just don't know how to describe it to you."</p><p>The inability to express oneself when needed is always regrettable. Xue Jun could not find the right words to describe Jiang Juan. After some thought, he suddenly realized, "How about this: tomorrow during the archery competition, let's invite him to join us."</p><p>"You seem to like him quite a bit," he said.</p><p>Gu Puwang did not comment on whether or not it was interesting, but he noted that Princess Li Wangfei seemed rather formidable. Xue Jun could never stop talking about Nian Ge and had always been influenced by Jiang Nian; this was the first time he had not come to Jiang Nian's defense. Gu Puwang did not mind and suggested they meet her to see what made Princess Li Wangfei so captivating, saying, "Do as you wish."</p><p>Jiang Nian esteems this person for his ambition and cunning.
