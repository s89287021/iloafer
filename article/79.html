						<p>Jiang Juan was determined to clear herself, completely unaware of how ambiguous her words sounded. </p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, "No matter how hard you try, it won't break?" </p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head and said, "Mm," "You hold me so lightly, are you not eating enough or something?" </p><p>"..." </p><p>A clear finger suddenly pinched at his chin, Xue Fangli lifted Jiang Juan's face. His gaze was innocent, but opening his mouth proved truly malicious; Xue Fangli said coolly, "If you can't speak, I'll say it for you." </p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?" </p><p>He emitted a short sound before being forcefully kissed. Jiang Juan understood his meaning, but it was too late. In the sticky and wetness, he could only futilely endure Xue Fangli's breath. </p><p>Once more, Xue Fangli pressed against his waist, using great force, rubbing his palm back and forth, the hot temperature making Jiang Juan feel as though he would melt away. </p><p>"You... you're messing with my waist." </p><p>Jiang Juan panted heavily, turning her head to start pushing Xue Fangli's hand, but Xue Fangli asked him, "If not your waist, then where?" </p><p>As long as he rubbed his waist again, it was too itchy. Jiang Juan grabbed his hand and placed it over her heart, pleading, "Rub here." </p><p>The silk was light, Xue Fangli's fingertips lightly pressed down, seemingly touching the delicate flesh beneath. He casually rubbed a few times, staring at Jiang Juan's soft red lips, then slowly began to speak. </p><p>"I'll rub your heart, what about you?" </p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes and looked at him blankly. Xue Fangli lowered his head, rubbing with one hand while kissing again. </p><p>"Kiss me enough for this king." </p><p>There was a tavern by the roadside.</p><p>"Second Young Master, how long have you rested, and are you finally stepping out?"</p><p>In the private room, Jiang Nian took a sip of tea as he heard Lady Cui say these words. He merely smiled at her without further explanation, "I was in a bad mood recently."</p><p>Lady Cui knew very well that he was in a bad mood and also understood why their Young Master was upset.</p><p>— Ever since the banquet at Princess Chang's residence, his reputation plummeted drastically, and he became the subject of much gossip. He decided to stay shut indoors.</p><p>"It’s good for you to come out and clear your mind."</p><p>Lady Cui tried to comfort him and refilled his tea. Jiang Nian did not feel the need to explain anything further.</p><p>His outing was not merely for clearing his mind; he had matters to attend to.</p><p>In his previous life, summers were never peaceful in southern China. Floods would occur, followed by peasant uprisings, leading to a chaotic situation.</p><p>Jiang Nian's task was to "predict" a disaster and then spread the news through beggars.</p><p>In his memory, after the ancestral worship ceremony, the Crown Prince would take over state affairs. He would send Marquis Anping to handle the flood, while Jiang Nian planned to accompany him southward, creating an illusion that wherever he went, the rain would cease.</p><p>At that time, both the court and the rebels would respect and revere him. From being gentle and refined Second Young Master Jiang, he would become a revered living Bodhisattva.</p><p>He would clear his name and once again stand at the pinnacle, stepping on his younger brother ruthlessly!</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Nian curled his lips into a smile. He lifted his head without intention and frowned slightly, "Why are there so many sisters and ladies here today?"</p><p>It was unusual to see female guests in the tavern, as storytellers did not mind eating meat or vegetables, so they would usually avoid it. However, most of today's visitors were women.</p><p>Hearing this, Lady Cui also felt something amiss, looking around but not quite understanding the reason. She recognized some unfamiliar faces among them.</p><p>"Young Master, don’t you recognize Miss Cui? The eldest daughter of the Minister of Personnel’s concubine. Ah, and she is accompanied by several other sisters—Madam Gu from Mansion Quan, Madam Kong from the Secretary’s residence…"</p><p>Cui Cui was more and more surprised as she recognized more of the "sisters," only to find that they were all daughters from noble families, the scene almost resembling a spring outing when they went out together for a stroll.</p><p>"How many sisters came?"</p><p>Cui Cui muttered softly, and Jiang Nian was also full of doubt. Just as he was about to think it over, he suddenly heard a "bang." The storyteller hit his wooden clapper and spoke in a drawn-out tone, "Today we will tell the story of Yingying and Zhang Sheng."</p><p>When he finished speaking, there were sighs from the audience, as if they were dissatisfied. The storyteller smiled bitterly, "Ladies, I know what stories you want to hear, but I have been telling this story for several consecutive days, every single session. How about we try a new one?"</p><p>"But we came here specifically to listen to you tell that story of the man and his concubine."</p><p>Hearing the word "concubine," Jiang Nian's heart skipped a beat. He looked over and saw that it was Cui Si from the Ministry of Personnel who was speaking, and her words were met with general agreement.</p><p>"That's right, we didn't come to hear you tell Yingying's story."</p><p>"Sir, please retell it once more."</p><p>"Oh, sir, none of us want to hear about Yingying today. We only wish to hear the story of Duke Li, his concubine, and Lord Anping."</p><p>The story of Duke Li, his concubine, and Lord Anping?</p><p>Jiang Nian frowned, sensing that something had happened recently, but since he had been staying in seclusion, he knew nothing about it. After a moment's thought, Jiang Nian said to Cui Cui, "Quickly go find out what is happening with Lord Anping."</p><p>Cui Cui responded, "Yes, sir."</p><p>Cui Cui turned and ran away. Jiang Nian took another sip of tea. His hatred for Jiang Juan had almost become part of his very being; just hearing her name twisted his face in anger.</p><p>Not long after, Jiang Nian managed to calm himself down. The storyteller also smiled faintly and conceded, "Alright, I will retell it."</p><p>"On that day, I was telling a story when suddenly someone in the second-floor balcony spoke up. He said forcefully..."</p><p>The storyteller narrated vividly, recounting everything that had happened at the tavern in great detail—</p><p>Inside the restaurant, laughter and joy filled the air. The King of Departure, whom people usually feared, actually gained approval for something concerning the favorite queen. Upon hearing this, the storyteller shook his head helplessly and had to repeat the story to them.</p><p>With a clap of the wooden paddle, the storyteller began from the beginning. Jiang Nian bit her lip, forcefully suppressing the resentment and jealousy caused by Jiang Juan, and started thinking about the part regarding Duke Ping.</p><p>The Marquis shattered the young maiden's jade pendant, reported it to the authorities, and was detained for three days.</p><p>Why would he do that???</p><p>Jiang Nian felt indignant. She drank several cups of tea but still couldn't suppress her anger, feeling only suffocating frustration.</p><p>Shameful, truly shameful.</p><p>The Marquis's actions not only affected himself but also forced Jiang Nian to lose face!</p><p>Taking a few deep breaths, Jiang Nian could no longer sit still. If she had to wait for Cui, she would rather find a beggar to spread the news and then immediately return home.</p><p>Fortunately, not long after, Cui came rushing over after finding out about today's events. She anxiously said, "Young Master! Young Master—! Something terrible has happened!"</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyelid twitched. Cui stammered, "The Marquis, the Marquis was detained by the authorities for three days and went mad when he came out!"</p><p>Jiang Nian suddenly stood up, not noticing that someone in the adjacent compartment had suspiciously picked up their teacup.</p><p>"...What did I mean by a constraint? It turns out to be this kind of constraint."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi muttered under his breath. The lady from the Chancellor's residence sitting in front of him glanced at him coldly and asked, "What are you mumbling about?"</p><p>Gu Yunzhi quickly sat up straight, flatteringly said, "Nothing, nothing, Lady, please continue listening to the story. I see that you enjoy it, so there's no need to pay attention to me."</p><p>He was famously afraid of his wife. Though the graceful Chancellor Gu Yunzhi looked imposing, he trembled with fear when returning home to face his wife, which was why he accompanied her on this day off to listen to a story in the restaurant.</p><p>Still, today's story did have some meaning, though there was one sentence that left a deep impression on Gu Yunzhi.</p><p>—"The Marquis, do you know that even if my consort allows me to leave the palace, I must still obediently go out."</p><p>To be honest, when Gu Yunzhi returned to his family mansion, he was just as much at her mercy. The moment she pointed somewhere, he would roll over there.</p><p>For a while, Gu Yunzhi felt a great sense of sympathy and even developed some regret for not having met the Prince earlier.</p><p>The Marquis, it turns out, is also somewhat afraid of his consort.</p><p>But that’s good to be afraid of one's consort.</p><p>Whenever he misbehaved, she would grab his ears and scold him until he was thoroughly humiliated. Now that Emperor Hongxing has made up his mind, the Crown Prince can only be Li Wang. Knowing that he fears his consort makes things much easier.</p><p>If it really comes down to it in the future, I can always report him to his consort.</p><p>Thinking of this, Gu Yunzhi exhaled deeply and all the frustration from trying to establish a crown prince disappeared.</p>
