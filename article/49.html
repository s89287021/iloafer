						<p>This rain came swiftly, yet lingered on for a long time before the clouds dispersed and the sun shone through. Duke of Ping stood rooted to the spot as raindrops dripped from his body. He found himself reminiscing about many things.</p><p>In those days, he avoided Jiang Juan at all costs; this fiancé he despised deeply, finding him shameful, yet Jiang Juan always made every effort to meet him.</p><p>At banquets, Jiang Juan would secretly request the maidservants to convey messages to him, begging for a word.</p><p>When gathering with friends, Jiang Juan would loiter around, and if invited to stay overnight, he would wait all night long just to have a conversation with him.</p><p>Whenever he invited Jiang Nian out for fun, Jiang Juan would follow along, even if he was completely indifferent or had repeatedly driven him away; he never held any grudge and remained infatuated.</p><p>...</p><p>All of this used to disgust him, but now as he recalled it again, Duke of Ping felt a wave of guilt.</p><p>Back then, Jiang Juan was timid, showing his love boldly and passionately only towards him.</p><p>Duke of Ping always found Jiang Juan lacking in solemnity and etiquette, unworthy of the stage and unqualified to enter the marquisate. He never responded to Jiang Juan's advances, only wanting to dissolve the engagement.</p><p>Did Jiang Juan also wait for him in the rain for a long time?</p><p>Duke of Ping frowned.</p><p>After waiting through an entire rainy night, this sudden surge of guilt made Duke of Ping wait even longer; no one came at all.</p><p>His heart sank with each passing moment.</p><p>Was he not coming?</p><p>No, it shouldn't be like that.</p><p>Despite all sorts of attempts, Prince Ping did not believe that everything could be erased in such a short time. How could Jiang Juan's feelings be so deep?</p><p>Xue Fangli must have some reason for not coming.</p><p>Meeting by the pond with Jiang Juan, this was something Prince Ping did not want to face Li Wang directly, nor did he wish to engage Xue Fangli excessively. However, at this moment, Prince Ping was unwilling to give up and still harbored a faint hope, so he decided to go and see what was happening.</p><p>Prince Ping slowly walked towards the main hall.</p><p>Inside Chengde Hall, the maidservant lighting the lamps lowered her eyes in reverence. The palace lanterns glowed brightly, illuminating the entire room as if it were broad daylight.</p><p>The lotus seed paste soup tasted just right; it was warm without being scalding. Jiang Juan took several mouthfuls and thought of how Wang Ye hadn't eaten anything at all, so she picked up a spoon to feed him too.</p><p>"Your Highness, try a taste."</p><p>The lotus seed paste soup had a refreshing flavor, but Xue Fangli lacked an appetite. He glanced down with lowered eyes, took hold of Jiang Juan's hand gently, and said calmly, "We can have it later."</p><p>As a master of deception, Jiang Juan knew immediately that Wang Ye was deceiving her, so she insisted on feeding him, "It will cool down soon; you should eat now."</p><p>She raised the spoon again and brought it to Xue Fangli's lips. Xue Fangli frowned slightly, looking rather weary. Jiang Juan asked slowly, "Your Highness, are you really not going to eat?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond. Jiang Juan continued softly, "In any case, I don't want Your Highness to always carry me around. If you don't eat now, it will be better if you can't carry me in the future."</p><p>After saying that, she lowered the spoon, and with a clatter, it hit the bowl's edge, truly no longer feeding him.</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched as he looked down at her, his fingers gently pressing Jiang Juan's face. "Threatening this king?"</p><p>Her voice was soft and gentle. This sentence coming from her mouth should have been threatening, but her expression was unusually mild, and Jiang Juan nodded with great determination, "Yeah, I'm threatening you."</p><p>"Is that scary?" Xue Fangli smiled lightly. "Then this king can only enjoy his meal properly."</p><p>Jiang Juan pushed the lotus seed paste soup to him. "Have it."</p><p>Xue Fali asked ❀: "Shouldn't it be you feeding?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "I don't want to feed, Your Highness, please eat by yourself."</p><p>Seeing this scene, Xue Chaohua was speechless with choking emotions.</p><p>To ask ❀ the Empress Consort to feed him; did Fifth Young Master not have a thumb?</p><p>Oh, he had a thumb, but it could only play with ❀'s thumb on the table.</p><p>It was so nauseatingly sweet.</p><p>Xue Chaohua rubbed his goosebumps and found that Xue Fali's appearance was more terrifying than ❀'s rash actions to kill.</p><p>GLIGENCE didn't realize someone had been standing outside the palace for a long time until the maid brought wine and let out a surprised cry.</p><p>"Viscount, why are you here?"</p><p>The voice wasn't loud but clear enough for everyone to hear. Even Jiang Juan lifted her head in surprise and found herself staring into ❀'s eyes unexpectedly.</p><p>Anping Viscount was soaked through and standing outside awkwardly, his feet full of water stains, glaring at Jiang Juan with vicious eyes.</p><p>Jiang Juan was unprepared and jumped in fright, causing Xue Fali, whom she had been holding in her arms, to stir instinctively. He lifted an eyelid.</p><p>Anping Viscount?</p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>Playing with Jiang Juan's thumb, Xue Fali seemed to have thought of something, giving Xue Chaohua a half-smile and a glance.</p><p>No wonder Jiang Juan was repeatedly invited to take a stroll.</p><p>"Dàgē, so that was the idea."</p><p>Xue Chaohua knew exactly why this banquet was held. Normally, he wouldn't have bothered, but due to the jade pendant engraved with the character "Huá," Xue Fangli had intended to visit Xue Chaohua anyway and thus accepted the invitation.</p><p>As for Jiang Juan, Xue Chaohua mentioned him specially, originally not planning to bring him along. It was only because Jiang Juan lacked an appetite that he changed his mind at the last minute.</p><p>Xue Fangli sent a glance over, causing Xue Chaohua's body to tremble slightly, nearly spilling the full cup of wine.</p><p>No matter how it was arranged in private, it couldn't be put on the table. Besides, this matter was not glorious. Xue Chaohua pretended to be surprised and said, "Houye, why did you come? You got soaked by the rain?"</p><p>"Come quickly, have some wine to warm yourself up; otherwise, you might catch a chill."</p><p>The Marquis of Anping didn't speak but stared intently at Jiang Juan.</p><p>Seated in someone's lap, his waist was encircled. From under the dark sleeves, an arm with clear joints stretched out, its fingers playing with Jiang Juan's hand as if he were accustomed to it.</p><p>Whether being held or showing affectionate gestures, in reality, the Marquis of Anping had arrived earlier and witnessed their shared meal in detail.</p><p>If there was any hope from the Marquis of Anping before, witnessing everything completely left only anger in him.</p><p>Having waited for such a long time in the rain, what was Jiang Juan doing?</p><p>Sitting shamelessly in Li Wang's arms, eating the food fed to him by Li Wang, and allowing him to publicly humiliate him.</p><p>He had found numerous reasons for himself.</p><p>As long as Li Wang was present, he couldn't extricate himself.</p><p>The rain was too heavy, making it impossible to move a step further.</p><p>Reality gave Li Ping Hou a vicious slap. She could not escape, she could not move a step forward, and she had likely been sitting in the arms of Prince Li since the beginning, basking in his affection.</p><p>How cheap was Jiang Juan's admiration?</p><p>Yesterday, she still looked at her with adoring eyes, but after marrying into the Li Wang Palace, it seemed as if all memories were erased. She treated Jiang Juan as a complete stranger and went to great lengths to distance herself from her.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Was it because of Prince Li?</p><p>The Emperor indulged her most, everyone feared her, except for Jiang Juan alone, who obtained a bit of pity from Prince Li's eyes, becoming immersed in it and feeling special, ultimately losing herself in the intoxication of wealth and fame.</p><p>How long could this pity last?</p><p>Was Prince Li truly a good man?</p><p>Truly foolish. Truly ignorant.</p><p>Li Ping Hou could not describe her current emotions; she was angry and resentful—angry at Jiang Juan's foolishness, resentful of Jiang Juan's heartlessness. Endless resentment surged up within her, making her feel unjustly treated and unwilling to accept it.</p><p>In any case, how could she wait in the rain without doing anything?</p><p>Looking at the engravings on the lotus leaves, even if she did not come, no one brought a word or message, leaving her to wait in the rain alone?</p><p>Thinking of this, Li Ping Hou became extremely angry, took a deep breath, and slowly walked into the palace. "Through the courtyard, through Your Highness, through—"</p><p>"Princess Consort."</p><p>The last two words were almost spat out with gritted teeth. Jiang Juan was somewhat bewildered, not knowing where Li Ping Hou's resentment towards her came from, so she pretended not to hear and lowered her head to play with the lotus leaves, trying to reduce her presence.</p><p>The rain was torrential, making it impossible to take a single step forward.</p><p>Reality dealt Li Ping Hou a harsh blow. She couldn't escape or move; she had likely been ensconced in Prince Li's arms since the beginning, basking in his affection.</p><p>How could Jiang Juan's admiration be so cheap?</p><p>Yesterday, her eyes sparkled with adoration, but after marrying into the Li Wang Palace, it seemed all memories were erased. She treated Jiang Juan as a stranger and did everything to sever ties with her.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Was it because of Prince Li?</p><p>The Emperor indulged her the most; everyone feared her, except for Jiang Juan, who found some pity in Prince Li's eyes, becoming ensnared in it and feeling special, ultimately losing herself in the opulence and debauchery.</p><p>How long could this pity last?</p><p>Was Prince Li truly a virtuous man?</p><p>Truly foolish. Truly ignorant.</p><p>Li Ping Hou couldn't describe her current feelings; she was both angry and resentful—angry at Jiang Juan's foolishness, resentful of her heartlessness. Endless resentment welled up within her, making her feel unjustly treated and unwilling to accept it.</p><p>In any case, how could she wait in the rain without taking action?</p><p>Looking at the inscriptions on the lotus leaves, even if she didn't come, no one brought a word or message, leaving her to wait in the rain alone?</p><p>Realizing this, Li Ping Hou grew extremely angry, took a deep breath, and slowly entered the palace. "Through the courtyard, through Your Highness—"</p><p>"Princess Consort."</p><p>The last two words were almost spat out with gritted teeth. Jiang Juan was bewildered, not knowing what had provoked Li Ping Hou's resentment towards her, so she pretended not to hear and lowered her head to play with the lotus leaves, trying to minimize her presence.</p><p>The rain was relentless, making it impossible to move a step forward.</p><p>Reality dealt Li Ping Hou a harsh blow. She couldn't escape or take another step; she had likely been ensconced in Prince Li's arms since the beginning, basking in his affection.</p><p>How could Jiang Juan's admiration be so cheap?</p><p>Yesterday, her eyes sparkled with adoration, but after marrying into the Li Wang Palace, it seemed all memories were erased.

"Through the courtyard, through Your Highness—"</p><p>"Princess Consort."</p><p>The last two words were almost spat out with gritted teeth. Jiang Juan was bewildered, not knowing what had provoked Li Ping Hou's resentment towards her, so she pretended not to hear and lowered her head to play with the lotus leaves, trying to minimize her presence.</p><p>Haphazardly rolling up the lotus leaves, Jiang Juan found his finger suddenly brushing against an uneven spot. He spread out the lotus leaves again and discovered a "ZHAO" written on them. Jiang Juan was puzzled, "How could there be words on the lotus leaves?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced over and raised his head with a mocking expression, "What a coincidence."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "What's so coincidental about it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "It seems someone's name contains this character."</p><p>Jiang Juan casually asked, "Is it an imperial concubine?"</p><p>He never paid attention to names when reading novels, so he didn't think much of it. Little did he know that these words made Lord Anping's expression turn grim.</p><p>How could Jiang Juan not know his name and surname?</p><p>"It's not her," Xue Fangli seemed satisfied with Jiang Juan's reaction and said with a half-smile, "Lord, if I'm not mistaken, you are Song Zhao Shi."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>Lord Anping?</p><p>The lotus leaves weren't given to him by an imperial concubine, were they?</p><p>Jiang Juan was shocked and quickly pushed away the lotus leaves.</p><p>He just didn't want any connection with Lord Anping, afraid of being recorded again as a victim of the protagonist. To Lord Anping, it looked like Jiang Juan was hastily trying to distance himself from him.</p><p>It would be one thing to make him wait in the rain, but now pretending not to know his name and avoiding him so much that even Lord Anping's usually calm demeanor began to crumble. He questioned Jiang Juan word by word, "If you harbor any resentment in your heart, speak up boldly. I have repeatedly told you that I feel guilty towards you and am willing to make amends. Why do you keep humiliating me over and over again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He asked doubtfully, "When did I ever humiliate you?"</p><p>Duke of Pingping said it once, then twice, and again. Jiang Juan only felt himself to be very wronged. After thinking for a moment, except for the incident at the bookstore last time, he really hadn't done anything else. Jiang Juan said, "If you feel I have dishonored you, it could be some misunderstanding. Tell me what it is, and maybe I can explain. But—" </p><p>Every time he encountered Duke of Pingping, he always talked about making amends. Jiang Juan thought this was not right, so he spoke to Duke of Pingping seriously again: "I don't have any resentment towards you and don't need you to make any amends. Really." </p><p>Feeling that Duke of Pingping might not believe him, Jiang Juan added, "Even if some amends are needed, there's the Prince."</p><p>Depart from the Prince, depart again.</p><p>Does one depart from the Prince and then can no longer live?</p><p>Duke of Pingping's blood rose, he asked solemnly, "Suppose this Duke always feels guilty and wants to make amends for you?"</p><p>Without hesitation, Jiang Juan replied, "Then just feel guilty."</p><p>Duke of Pingping would be emperor in the future, so Jiang Juan didn't want to offend him, but when he really couldn't hold it back anymore, he said, "It's you who feels guilty, not me. If you want to feel guilty, then do so. Anyway, I don't want your guilt and certainly don't need any amends from you."</p><p>"You've changed."</p><p>Duke of Pingping looked at him for a long time before struggling to speak again.</p><p>All that had happened, it turned out Jiang Juan had really distanced himself quickly.</p><p>He felt guilty and wanted to make amends, but Jiang Juan didn't want them.</p><p>Of course, Jiang Juan had changed—completely so, even the shell he lived in held a different person. However, Jiang Juan couldn't say this; instead, he secretly complained to Xue Fangli about it: "Prince, your words are too much."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows and smiled faintly, "Indeed, very noisy."</p><p>After a moment, he said, "No need to bother anymore, with this prince around."</p><p>At this point, the scene had become ugly. Even Duke of Pingping himself felt embarrassed, and every time he thought about it, he felt indignant, indignant to the extreme.</p><p>Jiang Juanzhen really had no lingering affection for !59531!.</p><p>How could !59531! not have a shred of affection for themselves?</p><p>If !59531! truly had no lingering affection, why would they keep the jade pendant?</p><p>Yes, the jade pendant was in !59531!'s possession.</p><p>Thinking about this, Marquis Anping's heart secretly ignited with hope once more. No matter how ruthless Jiang Juanzhen appeared and no matter how clearly she drew boundaries between them, as long as the jade pendant remained on !59531!, there would still be a connection between the two of them!</p><p>Marquis Anping seemed to have grabbed at the last straw. Wanting to say something more, Xue Chaohua calmly pushed !59531! aside and interceded, "Shizhao, if you have anything to say, let's discuss it later. Drink a cup of wine."</p><p>Xue Chaohua had to use some force to pull Marquis Anping over, and the maid hurriedly poured wine. However, Xue Chaohua cursed inwardly.</p><p>Wasn't Empress Li said to be infatuated with Marquis Anping?</p><p>Marquis Anping's behavior seemed more like !59531! was clinging to Empress Li instead.</p><p>This is——being tricked!? </p><p>Xue Chaohua was incredibly frustrated inside, but no matter what happened, he had to maintain a proper smile on his face. Perhaps it was the power of reason, but Xue Chaohua felt awkwardness like never before. Frowning heavily, he was interrupted by Zhegong.</p><p>"Your Majesty, entertainment, a show to lighten the mood."</p><p>Xue Chaohua suddenly came to his senses and clapped his hands, "I forgot about that. Quickly, bring out the show. They are all exquisite beauties I specially invited from the Red Sleeve Pavilion."</p><p>With Xue Chaohua's order, not long after, women in splendid attire entered one by one. They moved gracefully with every step, their postures elegant beyond compare, and their voices melodious as pearls.</p><p>Marquis Anping took a sip of wine, calming his turbulent emotions somewhat. He raised his head casually and was immediately drawn to something, his gaze stopping abruptly.</p><p>The lead woman tossed her sleeves and lightly leaped up, the tinkling sound of her jade ornaments resonating.</p><p>And that accessory, the Marquis of Ping was no stranger to it.</p><p>It depicted a magpie perched on a branch, symbolizing the sealing of a marriage contract.</p><p>This was precisely &#59531;&#8204; and Jiang Juan's token of love!</p><p>It should have been kept with Jiang Juan&#58960;&#8204;, but it appeared on the lead dancer—a courtesan!</p>
