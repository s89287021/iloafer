						<p>The palace maiden helped Jiang Juan make an abrupt movement, and she instinctively raised her head, immediately letting out a short exclamation.</p><p>Her voice was not loud, but Xue Fangli still heard it. He looked over.</p><p>This glance nearly drove him mad.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell onto the carpet, his clothes in disarray, black hair spilling everywhere. His skin was very white, but not the kind of creamy jade-white from a life of luxury; instead, it had a sickly hue, like snow.</p><p>The carpet was a vibrant color, and he closed his eyes again. He was already weak and frail, now even more delicate than morning mist or easily shatterable glass.</p><p>He did not move at all, as if devoid of vitality.</p><p>In a daze, Xue Fangli saw that woman again. Everything before him turned red, both the crimson blood pool and the flickering flames. She wore her wedding gown, fingers clutching sharp blades, droplets of blood falling one by one.</p><p>She smiled gently, "Fangli, listen to me. In your life, you came with people's expectations and left with their longing. You have nothing and cannot keep anything."</p><p>Xue Fangli approached step by step.</p><p>His steps were not heavy, but slow. Yet with each step, the palace maiden felt a wave of terror, immense pressure making her body stiffen.</p><p>Xue Fangli extended his hand toward Jiang Juan. Before touching him, he withdrew it into his sleeve, his bloodshot eyes fixating on the palace maiden. He said coldly, "Look at what happened to him."</p><p>With such a ferocious gaze, the palace maiden was terrified. She held back tears and cautiously probed Jiang Juan's breathing with her fingers.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Just as he fainted, the prince rushed over, seemingly thinking something had happened to him.</p><p>This is too coincidental, isn't it.</p><p>Does he need to turn over?</p><p>In such an embarrassing situation, Jiang Juan was momentarily at a loss for what to do. He pondered for a moment and decided that while escaping would be shameful, it would also be effective, so he chose to continue pretending to be dead. However, Jiang Juan deliberately controlled his breathing to make it more steady.</p><p>"Y-Your Highness," the maid trembled as she spoke, "Princess Consort has merely fainted."</p><p>"Just fainted?" Xue Fangli echoed her last words, almost gritting out each word, "Why hasn't the imperial physician been summoned yet?"</p><p>The maid shuddered in fright. "Yes, Your Highness, I will go right away!"</p><p>After speaking, she hastily got up and rushed out with cold sweat on her forehead.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and reached out to brush Jiang Juan's hair away from his face. His movements were gentle, but the blue veins on his pale handbacks stood out prominently.</p><p>Inexplicable rage boiled within him, almost overwhelming him. At that moment, even if the faint and shallow breaths of youth surrounded him, Xue Fangli could not calm down.</p><p>Having lived a life filled with hatred and weariness all his days, he had nothing but indifference for everything, and he had never left anyone behind.</p><p>Except for Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Grandmother, it's been a long time."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted the curtain and spoke calmly, his voice as cold as ice.</p><p>The Empress Dowager raised her chin and asked him coldly, "Who gave you permission to enter?"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored her and merely looked up at the altar. After a while, he said coolly, "Grandmother has always punished people by making them kneel. How long have you made him kneel?"</p><p>The Empress Dowager looked at him coldly and suddenly smiled. "You remember clearly, then. It seems that when I had you kneel for some time back then, you still have an impression."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled thinly. "My memory is as fresh as ever."</p><p>The Empress Dowager sighed, "Strange that I believed the abbot's words that you were born to be a maleficent influence. I didn't believe it, how was I proven wrong?"</p><p>"Your mother—Yue Meiniang—was actually killed by you."</p><p>The Empress Dowager lamented, "Fortunately, I managed to find a method to mitigate it in time, or else this ominous star of yours would have caused more disasters."</p><p>Xue Fangli listened quietly and smiled, saying, "Is it possible that Your Majesty doesn't know whether it was truly this king who killed?"</p><p>"You claim you are devoted to Buddhism and do not concern yourself with the affairs of the former court," Xue Fangli said, "but your heart is clearer than anyone else's. It's not that you don't ask; rather, you cannot afford to ask. The Emperor respects you, but he hates you even more."</p><p>"You—!"</p><p>The Empress Dowager's expression darkened.</p><p>Since the fire in Spring Deep Palace, she and Emperor Hongxing had developed a rift. Emperor Hongxing had not set foot in Cining Palace for over ten years. She had been resentful and furious, but Emperor Hongxing remained unmoved, and their mother-son relationship was completely severed.</p><p>She had lived deep within the palace for many years, unwilling to see Emperor Hongxing, yet he had still reserved some dignity for her, saying she was devoted to Buddhism. Today, Xue Fangli's straightforward words made the Empress Dowager extremely angry.</p><p>"I only allowed your queen consort to enter the palace not long ago, and you immediately rushed over from Miaolin Temple. You care about him, but compared to me, you should be more concerned with yourself. He is inherently ill-fated; who knows if he can endure this maleficent influence?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slowly, "His well-being does not require Your Majesty's concern."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli asked her, "How long did you make him kneel?"</p><p>Jiang Juan first started talking about the fate of a young boy and then mentioned Venerable Ananda. The Empress Dowager had not made him kneel, but she was not going to reveal this.</p><p>—As the Empress Dowager, even if she really made Jiang Juan kneel, what could he do?</p><p>The Empress Dowager smiled, "Do you think that's how he fainted?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, his eyes filled with coldness.</p><p>The Empress Dowager continued, "Since you still remember that I made you kneel before me, you should also remember how to resolve it. If you truly care about your concubine, why don't you help her resolve it as well?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond but merely walked toward the altar. The Buddha sat solemnly on the lotus platform, his eyes half-closed with a look of compassionate sorrow.</p><p>He had once knelt there for more than ten days, with the corpse of Yu Meiniang beside him. A chain fell, and he watched helplessly as she decomposed, her beauty turning into mud. He had been afraid and pleaded for mercy, but no one had listened to him.</p><p>Though the Buddha was compassionate, he had never received any benefit from it.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli spoke each word slowly, "This king does not believe in ghosts or deities."</p><p>As he finished speaking, he raised his hand and swept his sleeves down with a wave. "Bang!" The statue of the Buddha toppled to the ground!</p><p>"How dare you do such an evil deed?" The Empress Dowager rose in shock, "You have knocked over the Buddha's statue, causing blood to flow from its body, committing the five cardinal sins and ten heinous crimes! You will be sent to hell after death!"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and said, "I was destined for hell anyway."</p><p>He raised his sleeves again, sweeping all the memorial tablets off. "This king does not believe in ghosts or deities. Let this king make my concubine kneel—"</p><p>"They cannot bear it."</p><p>The Empress Dowager was furious and pointed at him angrily, "These are the ancestors of the Xue family! How dare you do such a thing? You ungrateful descendant, how dare you…"</p><p>Xue Fangli responded nonchalantly, "How can this king not dare?"</p><p>"If they have spirits in heaven, they will definitely not forgive you lightly!"</p><p>"If they truly have spirits…" Xue Fangli said impatiently, "Father Emperor owes me, she owes me, and Your Majesty also owes me. They—they owe this king as well!"</p><p>"The abbot said that this king is a celestial calamity star, the root of evil and disaster," Xue Fangli continued, "Grandmother Empress, you believe in the cycle of retribution."</p><p>"If so, then you should believe that I have committed too many sins. This king has come to collect my debt."</p><p>He smiled, his body drenched in blood, horrifying to the extreme.</p><p>"Grandmother, this is the first time and will be the last time, I fear nothing, absolutely nothing."</p><p>The Empress Dowager stared at him for a long while, until she began to tremble all over. In the end, she didn't say a single word and slumped into her chair.</p><p>How could she have forgotten that he naturally feared nothing? Being barefoot was no more frightening than wearing shoes. She was the Empress Dowager, but Xue Fali was a madman who would do anything when driven by madness, and Hongxing Emperor even indulged him!</p><p>The Empress Dowager gasped for breath urgently, causing her vision to darken.</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart was also filled with complex emotions.</p><p>The Prince believed that he had fainted due to kneeling too long, causing his heart condition to flare up, and decided to speak up on his behalf.</p><p>But he hadn't knelt at all; he didn't have a heart condition either. He simply wanted to take a break.</p><p>The Prince looked extremely concerned.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt very guilty, regretting that he hadn't turned over earlier. Now, even if he did turn over, it would be too late.</p><p>The imperial physician had already arrived.</p><p>Xue Fali picked up Jiang Juan and let the physician examine his pulse. Despite knowing that he had congenital insufficiencies, Jiang Juan couldn't help but feel a bit nervous.</p><p>"The Empress Consort... "</p><p>The physician frowned and said, "The pulse is slow with intermittent stops, indicating a weak liver condition, which can lead to fainting due to heart disease. However, the Empress Consort seems well-nourished, with harmonious blood flow, so there should be no major issues for now."</p><p>Jiang Juan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Xue Fali asked, "When will he wake up?"</p><p>The Grand Physician pondered, "W-well… it’s not certain, but it won’t be long."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded. Since there was no major issue, he did not plan to stay any longer. He picked up Jiang Juan and left the Cining Palace, without noticing anyone watching him.</p><p>Or rather, he noticed, but could not be bothered to give a single glance.</p><p>After they were far away, Jiang Nian emerged from behind the rockery.</p><p>The maid Diancui was astonished, "Young Master, was that His Highness Prince Li? How did he… how did he…"</p><p>According to rumors, Prince Li was cruel and tyrannical. However, based on what she had just seen, though Prince Li’s expression while holding someone in his arms was terrifyingly vicious, his actions were surprisingly gentle, as if—</p><p>"as if he feared breaking the person in his arms."</p><p>After finishing her exclamation, Diancui looked up and met Jiang Nian’s venomous gaze. She jumped in fright, her heart pounding uncontrollably. "Y-young Master, did I say something wrong?"</p><p>"No," Jiang Nian took a deep breath, suppressing the rising jealousy and resentment in his heart, and smiled gently. "Why are you so scared?"</p><p>Diancui mustered up some courage to look at him again. The venom she had seen earlier seemed like an illusion; Jiang Nian’s smile was warm and affectionate. Diancui did not pursue it further. "I think I saw wrong just now, thought I said something that displeased Young Master."</p><p>Jiang Nian patiently asked, "When have I ever offended anyone?"</p><p>Diancui stuck out her tongue. "I guess I saw wrong."</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled but tightly clenched his hand in his sleeves.</p><p>He knew of the long-standing resentment between Empress Dowager and Yu Meiniang, as well as Empress Dowager’s hatred towards Prince Li.</p><p>In his previous life, he was the concubine of Prince Li. When he encountered Empress Dowager at Cangan Temple, she had given him a thorough dressing-down. That was why he had specially mentioned Jiang Juan a few days ago.</p><p>Why should only he be humiliated?</p><p>Thinking of carrying Jiang Juan away, Jiang Nian felt extremely relieved. Jiang Juan also endured some torment and seemed to have fainted.</p><p>However, Prince Li also knew that he had come to fetch Jiang Juan, and he secretly harbored a bit of resentment.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Cingning Palace arrived. Jiang Nian calmed down slightly and pushed open the door.</p><p>"Empress Dowager..."</p><p>He raised his head and saw Empress Dowager, who had been domineering towards him in their previous life but was now kind-hearted, sitting on her chair with a gentle expression. A palace maid was lightly patting her back to comfort her, saying, "Empress Dowager, don't be too upset. Ruining your health isn't worth it."</p><p>"Why am I so soft-hearted? I didn't make that Wangfei kneel before me properly!"</p><p>Amidst the chaos on the floor, with the Buddha statue shattered and memorial tablets overturned, such daring actions could only have come from one person's hand. Empress Dowager's words made Jiang Nian lose even his remaining sense of relief.</p><p>In the end, he was still the only one who endured torment.</p><p>And among those who escaped unscathed, Jiang Juan was being played with by Xue Fang.</p><p>The main character truly deserved to be adored and pampered. In the novel, Empress Dowager was so amiable towards him, but when she switched to the Prince, he didn't receive such treatment anymore, even though they were indeed major antagonists.</p><p>Ah, and Empress Dowager also made the Prince kneel before her, and he mentioned that he still remembered it vividly.</p><p>Jiang Juan had originally decided to pretend to be dead until the end but changed his mind. He slowly opened his eyes, pretending to wake up midway through, "Prince..."</p><p>He struggled with what to say next, furrowing his brow. Xue Fang asked, "Still feeling uncomfortable?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback for a moment before nodding, completing his act. "Yeah, just a little bit."</p><p>"I think I heard you mention..." Jiang Juan whispered, "Empress Dowager also made you kneel for a long time. It shouldn't have been a dream, right?"</p><p>"Um."</p><p>"That... how long did she make you kneel?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked cautiously. It had been ten days, but he could easily have brushed it over vaguely. However, Xue Fangli seemed to know something and stated precisely, "Fourteen days."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan was shocked. Kneeling for so long must have been unbearable. He sympathized with Xue Fangli, "How could she do that? Bullying you like this."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and met his gaze.</p><p>His pupils were bright, his brows slightly furrowed, as if he were deeply troubled. Jiang Juan saw a hint of pity in his eyes, similar to the Buddha statue's expression.</p><p>Yet, the Buddha pitied all beings, while Jiang Juan pitied only him; at this moment, it was solely for him.</p><p>Any anger that could have flared up, any fierce rage, was extinguished instantly by the love he saw in Jiang Juan's eyes. Xue Fangli almost drowned in Jiang Juan's pitying gaze.</p><p>Jiang Juan softly comforted him, "It's all over now."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time before responding with a single "Um."</p><p>The breath between them was sweet and warm, his chest filled with warmth again.</p><p>"You fainted from the pain but still managed to hear about this."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his scarlet lips and smiled softly, "You really are my little Bodhisattva."</p>
