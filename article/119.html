						<p>"Jüan'er, are you going to the library?"</p><p>Jiang Juan just finished packing his things. His roommate heard the noise and hurriedly took off his headphones, saying to him, "Hold a seat for me, I'll be there after I finish this."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a "Mm," and once he confirmed, the roommate turned back to the keyboard, tapping away loudly as he operated his character and chatted with others.</p><p>"Jüan'er? He's my roommate."</p><p>"You definitely haven't heard of him. He was sick before, took a leave of absence, and hasn't come to school ever since."</p><p>"That's not exactly cool; he has heart disease. He doesn't need to go to school, but he still needs surgery."</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Juan closed the dormitory door and walked out of the building, feeling a wave of heat hit him.</p><p>In July or August, cicadas buzzed loudly. The university was well-groomed with trees casting dappled shadows, illuminating the ground faintly.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed.</p><p>It's so hot; I wish I could go back to my dormitory and turn on the air conditioner.</p><p>Why is the library so far away?</p><p>When will the school bus arrive?</p><p>Until today, it had been three or four months since Jiang Juan returned from the book.</p><p>In his family's eyes, after the successful surgery, Jiang Juan simply fell into a five-day coma due to extreme weakness. In reality, Jiang Juan spent many years in another era.</p><p>Readjusting to modern times was quite difficult for Jiang Juan. Seeing him sullen every day, his cousin suggested that he continue his studies.</p><p>Jiang Juan almost made the hospital her home, but her studies did not fall behind. There was a tutor hired for him at home, and he also took the college entrance exam, although he had to take a leave of absence due to his health condition and never officially enrolled.</p><p>After the successful surgery, it was time to resume a normal life, so Jiang Juan went to University A. </p><p>Who would have thought that after being the queen for such a long time, Jiang Juan returned as a student, only to encounter the end of the semester just in time. He had several papers due and many books to read, leaving him feeling disillusioned.</p><p>After waiting for quite some time, the school bus finally arrived. Jiang Juan got on and quickly reached the library.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not arrive particularly early; the first floor was almost full of people. Therefore, as soon as he entered the elevator, Jiang Juan directly went to the sixth floor.</p><p>Recently, the library had been experiencing power outages in the evenings, making higher floors even more inconvenient, so fewer people went there.</p><p>Jiang Juan chose a window seat and started reading. </p><p>Ah, there are so many words.</p><p>It was slightly dizzying.</p><p>After reading only a few pages, Jiang Juan fell asleep on the table. Just then, his phone, which had been placed beside him, lit up. He picked it up to find that his roommate was leaving.</p><p>[Juan-er, I'm here.]</p><p>[Which floor are you on?]</p><p>Jiang Juan typed a reply.</p><p>[On the sixth floor.]</p><p>Twenty minutes later, his roommate emerged from the elevator wearing headphones and listening to music, swaying along with the melody. However, after taking just a few steps, he spotted Jiang Juan's seat and his expression changed.</p><p>"Juan-er, why are you sitting here?"</p><p>Roommate pressed the headphone to pause the music and whispered to Jiang Juan, "Hurry up and leave, we can't sit here."</p><p>Jiang Juan found it strange, "Why can't we sit?"</p><p>Roommate mumbled, "We can't provoke that madman."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "What?"</p><p>He looked at his roommate blankly. This spot didn't seem to have any particular feature; Jiang Juan had just chosen it randomly. If anything, this place was relatively quiet and offered a good view.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan's confusion, the roommate recalled that he wasn't in school previously and elaborated, "Do you know about the Xue family? That... old Xue we often see on TV."</p><p>As he spoke, the roommate took out his phone and showed Jiang Juan a name; it was indeed a famous elderly man. Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah, I know him."</p><p>The roommate continued, "They have only one son in the Xue family, who is the future crown prince, and he's here in our school. He—"</p><p>"Has pretty severe bipolar disorder."</p><p>Roommate asked Jiang Juan, "Do you know why our school library is so luxurious? It was during military training when he had a fit and got into a fight with someone; his family donated a sum of money."</p><p>To be fair, it wasn't entirely the Schuyler's fault. After all, the other party had been secretly taking photos in the women's restroom, only to run into Schuyler afterwards. He was afraid of being reported to school and kept harassing him with pleas and threats of suicide, which finally enraged Schuyler.</p><p>What happened after he got enraged wasn't entirely clear, as there were no cameras in the restroom. But when security arrived, that person was covered in blood, pinned against a railing with most of his body hanging outside. Schuyler's voice was detached, "Still want to die? I'll fulfill your wish."</p><p>"I think he might have wanted to kill him then."</p><p>Roommate had been there and described how frightening the future crown prince's viciousness was. After telling Jiang Juan about it, he added, "Later, one of his high school classmates said he has bipolar disorder, so..."</p><p>"Let's go let's go, he often sits here. Let's find another spot; no one dares to provoke him."</p><p>Jiang Juan, however, seemed distracted.</p><p>The surname is Xue.</p><p>What about this behavior?</p><p>What's going on? Is it just a coincidence?</p><p>"Sleepy."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan staring blankly, his roommate quickly intervened and pushed him, "Hurry up! In case he has another episode, we won't..."</p><p>With a "thud," a bottle of mineral water was placed on the table. The sound wasn't loud, but it came too suddenly for Jiang Juan to react immediately. He instinctively looked over.</p><p>He saw a hand that was beautiful in shape with clear joints.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, almost holding his breath.</p><p>The other person was a tall and slender youth with sharp features and a cold demeanor.</p><p>His skin was very pale, but his lips were extremely red, making him look like someone with rosy cheeks and white teeth. However, there was an aura of hostility all over him. He lifted his eyelids and glanced lazily at Jiang Juan.</p><p>In the next second, the youth paused in his actions.</p><p>Silence, a long silence.</p><p>After a while, the youth spoke up. He uttered one word, "You..."</p><p>The roommate nearly fainted. Was it really Xue Fangli here? Just as he was thinking about what he had just said—about him having another episode.</p><p>The grass.</p><p>Did he hear it?</p><p>And there was Juan'er, sitting in his usual spot.</p><p>His roommate struggled to swallow a mouthful of saliva, feeling that they were both doomed, especially when Xue Fangli picked up the bottle of mineral water he had placed on the table again.</p><p>They... are done for.</p><p>The roommate's legs went weak, and his vision started to blur. But then—</p><p>"Do you want to drink some water?" Xue Fangli asked.</p><p>The roommate was stunned. "Ah? I don't..."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "I do."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, naturally unscrewing the cap and handing the mineral water bottle to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan took it.</p><p>There was still frost on the bottle of mineral water, emitting a faint chill; Jiang Juan's fingertips got wet. He bent down to take a small sip, then slowly raised his head, squinting at Xue Fangli with a smile, "Thank you, you are really a good person."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his eyebrows twitching slightly, but he said nothing.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan said again, "I am Jiang Juan. My nickname is Jiang Lan."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Xue Fangli."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, slowly saying, "Hello, nice to meet you."</p><p>Xue Fangli murmured softly, reaching out to pinch the soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face. He seemed to be smiling faintly as he said, "Wrong, it's been a long time."</p><p>Jiang Juan stared back at him with sparkling eyes, and after a long while, he finally corrected himself, "Yeah, it's been a long time."</p><p>They had met again after a long separation, but someone felt out of place.</p><p>Roommate: "???" </p><p>What was going on???</p><p>Shouldn't they be getting punished?</p><p>How did the mineral water in Juien's hand get there??</p><p>Xue Fangli even gave him back the bottle cap!?</p><p>Something was not right here!?</p>
