Xue Fangli did not try to pacify him, because he was right!</p><p>He wasn't that angry at first, but this thought successfully made him furious.</p><p>"Sir."</p><p>Lanting knocked on the door. She had heard what happened from outside and knew that Jiang Juan's mood might not be good, so she didn't push open the door directly. Instead, she stood outside and asked, "Do you want to see…"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan perked up his ears.</p><p>Lanting whispered softly, "Do you want to see the Sixth Emperor—Jingwang?"</p><p>Why is it Xue Congjun?</p><p>Jiang Juan said listlessly, "See him."</p><p>Lanting then spoke a few words to someone. Soon after, the door was pushed open, and Xue Congjun walked in with great fanfare.</p><p>Things are different from before; Jiang Juan has been promoted, and Xue Congjun is no longer the Sixth Prince but the mighty Jingwang. Everyone who sees him must call him Your Highness, a very imposing figure indeed.</p><p>Of course, when he meets Jiang Juan, Xue Congjun still has to honestly call him brother.</p><p>"Brother Juan, hehe."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He looked at Xue Congjun in surprise and said slowly, "Be normal. Do you know how scary you look like this?"</p><p>"This can't be my fault," Xue Congjun said with a delighted expression, "Brother Juan, you are truly reliable."</p><p>If Jiang Juan hadn't been unconscious for many days, Xue Congjun would have come to tell him the good news long ago.</p><p>In the beginning, Xue Congjun asked Jiang Juan to whisper in his ear beside the pillow, hoping to become a carefree prince. Jiang Juan only said he would ask, but when the imperial edict came down, Xue Congjun's fief was indeed a good place, so good that even his elder brother Xue Chaohua drooled when he heard about it.</p><p>"Hehe, hehe."</p><p>Xue Congjun thought back to this matter and laughed until his cheeks hurt. He started laughing foolishly again, "Brother Juan, how did you whisper in Brother Wu's ear? Brother Wu really gave me a good place and didn't make me leave immediately like my elder brother. I can stay in the capital for a few more days."</p><p>"Ah?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was initially puzzled after hearing this, then felt a wave of guilt because he had forgotten about it.</p><p>Jiang Juan explained, "I didn't whisper in anyone's ear."</p><p>Xue Congjun winked at him, "Okay, okay, you didn't blow pillow talk. You didn't blow pillow talk."</p><p>Jiang Juan was helpless, "... I really didn't."</p><p>Xue Congjun just thought he was embarrassed and didn't take it seriously at all. Jiang Juan looked at him, wanting to say something but stopping himself as he wasn't sure how to clear himself. He only changed the subject, "Why is it only you? Where are Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang?"</p><p>"They ah," Xue Congjun said, "are busy. You fainted for not long, Jiang Qingliang went with the army to the border, and as for Gu Puwang, they seem to be investigating a case in Dali Temple, so he left the capital too."</p><p>Hearing Jiang Juan ask about Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang, Xue Congjun slapped his forehead, remembering something, and muttered, "They reminded me several times before leaving that if you woke up, I should tell them. I forgot, but I'll send a message to them when I go back."</p><p>"They are not in the capital."</p><p>Previously, all of them were still at the National College, often hanging out together and playing around, which was quite fun. But now, whether it was Jiang Qingliang or Gu Puwang, they had their own things to do, and gathering again would not be as easy.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan remembered that in the original text, Jiang Qingliang later became the famous General Xiao, as agile on the battlefield as a fish in water, his fame spreading far and wide.</p><p>As for Gu Puwang, he was already a talented gentleman with outstanding talent. He was bold yet meticulous, achieving countless military achievements, and would later be appointed Chancellor, becoming the top official among civil servants.</p><p>Only Xue Congjun had no great aspirations, only wanting to be a leisurely prince, idling away his days. Now he could be said to have realized his dream.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan felt slightly better.</p><p>Everyone was busy, but they all lived quite well, each achieving remarkable success in their fields of interest or living lives that they enjoyed.</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke with a hint of regret, but Xue Congjun misunderstood him. He also said, "It’s kind of a pity. Fifth Brother planned to have another ceremony with you again, but they couldn’t make it."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "How do you know?"</p><p>Xue Congjun boasted, "Of course I know. You don’t have any brothers—oh, except that one is like having none. Anyway, when the time comes, I’ll carry you in a sedan chair."</p><p>Upon saying this, Xue Congjun showed no regret at all.</p><p>It was fortunate that they weren’t there; otherwise, just over who would carry Brother Juan, the three of them would have fought a battle.</p><p>Xue Congjun began to laugh foolishly again, "Hehe, Brother Juan, hehe."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>"Calmer down," Jiang Juan honestly said, "We just had an argument. He doesn’t even want to talk to me now; who knows if we’ll go through with the ceremony again?"</p><p>Xue Congjun’s eyes widened in surprise, "What? What happened between you two?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and then recounted everything that had happened to Xue Congjun.</p><p>"In any case, I tricked him, and he tricked me."</p><p>After listening, Xue Congjun fell into silence.</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "…………"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him. Xue Congjun bit his lip, furrowing his brow fiercely, his face contorted. Jiang Juan could only say, "You go ahead and laugh."</p><p>Unable to bear it anymore, Xue Congjun burst into a thunderous laughter, "Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha."</p><p>In Xue Congjun's opinion, his fifth brother, who had always been shrewd, probably made this one mistake. But how could his fifth brother still pretend to cough up blood to deceive others?</p><p>The more Xue Congjun thought about it, the funnier he found it, and he burst into laughter again.</p><p>Jiang Juan said gloomily, "Why are you still laughing?"</p><p>Xue Congjun wiped away the tears from the corner of his eyes, "It's just too funny hahahaha."</p><p>After a pause, Xue Congjun asked Jiang Juan, "So... Brother Juan, were your heart conditions in the past all fake?"</p><p>There was nothing to hide about it. Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah, they were all fake."</p><p>Xue Congjun raised his thumb at him and praised with a tsk-tsk, "You did a pretty convincing job."</p><p>Of course he had, Jiang Juan was a veteran of heart disease patients; faking an episode was child's play. But he didn't need to explain that to Xue Congjun. Jiang Juan pursed his lips.</p><p>Xue Congjun laughed to himself for a while before carefully saying, "Brother Juan, try to look on the bright side. After all, you deceived my fifth brother, and he deceived you. Didn't you even out?"</p><p>While that was true, Jiang Juan didn't know what Xue Fangli thought about it.</p><p>Jiang Juan said he would no longer have anything to do with him and even walked out, but Xue Fangli didn't stop him.</p><p>Jiang Juan was afraid he would be angry.</p><p>But Jiang Juan also felt... why should he be angry?</p><p>Mingming, Jiang Juan seemed to be deceived quite a bit.</p><p>Seeing that Jiang Juan did not speak up, Xue Congjun hesitated for a moment and then cautiously asked Jiang Juan, "Brother Juan, do you know what my fifth brother did during the days when you were unconscious?"</p><p>Jiang Juan knew a little about it: "He sent people to smash the temple and had many monks bound."</p><p>Xue Congjun said, "It's not just that."</p><p>"There is a tower in the capital called Jinghua Tower," Xue Congjun continued. "Thirty-six stories tall, it is said that by bowing at the top floor, an enlightened Buddha will appear, granting one’s wishes."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned; he did have an impression of this tower.</p><p>"You're saying that…"</p><p>There was a bit of a guess in Jiang Juan's mind, but he wasn't entirely sure. Xue Congjun explained to Jiang Juan, "That day, the imperial doctors were at a loss, so my fifth brother went to Jinghua Tower and bowed all the way to the top floor for you."</p><p>Even today, when Xue Congjun recalled that day's events, it still felt like a dream. His fifth brother actually knelt in the pagoda, bowing step by step, solely praying for one person’s safety.</p><p>"Why did he kneel…"</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes widened.</p><p>Jiang Juan disliked kneeling people, and although Xue Fangli never told Jiang Juan if he liked it or not, Jiang Juan knew that Xue Fangli also didn't like it. After all, Xue Fangli was so arrogant and haughty that no one was worthy of his bowing.</p><p>Moreover, Xue Fangli did not even believe in ghosts and gods.</p><p>How could he kneel?</p><p>How could he possibly kneel?</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes flickered, thinking that he knew the answer.</p><p>Xue Congyun said, "For you."</p><p>Yes, for him.</p><p>If not for him, Xue Fangli would never have knelt to anyone and would never have placed hope in ghosts or gods.</p><p>This bad thing seemed to be obsessed with only two things: bullying him and being nice to him.</p><p>Apart from that, Xue Fangli had no interest in anything else.</p><p>No one enjoyed bullying Jiang Juan more than he did.</p><p>And no one was nicer to Jiang Juan more than he was.</p><p>"I don't know..."</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly felt very regretful. He shouldn't have been angry at Xue Fangli, and he definitely shouldn't have said those things to him, even if it was out of fear that they would be used against him.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan also knew that he had been spoiled by Xue Fangli for so long. All his bad temper and capriciousness had only ever been directed at Xue Fangli.</p><p>He shouldn't have acted like that.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jiang Juan suddenly jumped out of bed and ran outside barefoot.</p><p>"Brother Juan, where are you going?"</p><p>Xue Congyun was stunned and instinctively followed him. When he opened the door, Xue Fangli was standing right there.</p><p>He didn't know how long he had been standing there. He raised one hand as if to knock on the door but then did not.</p><p>"I'm sorry..."</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly hugged him, burying her face in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>"Why are you running around barefoot?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and reached out to hug Jiang Juan around the waist, lifting her up.</p><p>He intended to put her on the bed, but after a few steps, he stopped and asked, "Why are you crying?"</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't lift her head; she just asked him, "Are you tired?"</p><p>"Knocking on each level of a thirty-seven-story pagoda, aren't you tired?"</p><p>Hearing this, Xue Fangli glanced at Xue Congyun. Xue Congyun shrank his shoulders and lowered his head guiltily, practically admitting to it.</p><p>He touched his nose, looked around nervously, and stammered, "Elder Brother Wu, since you have something with Brother Juan, why don't... I leave first?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond. At this moment, Xue Congyun was quick-witted; if his Elder Brother Wu didn't stop him, it meant he wanted him to go away. Xue Congyun quickly left.</p><p>"Elder Brother Wu, Brother Juan, I'm leaving!"</p><p>Xue Congyun slipped away gracefully and even closed the door for them out of consideration, but he felt quite pleased inside.</p><p>——Fortunately, he was smart and brought up the topic of knocking on the pagoda. His Elder Brother Wu's marriage to Brother Juan must not fall through; he had to make Brother Juan carry him and drive Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang crazy!</p><p>After Xue Congyun left, only Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli remained in the room.</p><p>Xue Fangli originally didn't intend to tell Jiang Juan about kneeling at the pagoda. He knew her personality too well; he had already anticipated that she would cry again if she found out. However, she still learned about it.</p><p>"Not tired."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes and said, "I'm just a bit scared. Scared that even if I kneel for thirty-seven levels, it won't make any difference."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not speak, his pale fingers gripping the collar of his shirt, trembling lightly.</p><p>After a while, he slowly raised his head, reaching out to touch Xue Fangli's forehead and asked him, "Does it hurt?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Not at all."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Juan was slightly angry. "How can you not be tired or in pain? You don't tell me anything."</p><p>"You don't cough blood, yet you keep using this trick to soften my heart. When something is really wrong with you, you hide it from me. What do you want to do?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was very confused; he truly did not understand.</p><p>"I wanted your heart to be soft, but I didn't want to see you cry."</p><p>"But because you cough blood, haven't I cried too?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "So I regret it."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyebrows drooped. "I'm sorry."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him for a long time before asking again, "Are you really not in pain or tired?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xue Fangli replied, "When I worshiped the pagoda, all I thought about was my wife returning safely. On each level, I prayed for her, and with every bow, I kept thinking about her, leaving no time for anything else."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes fluttered, tears silently rolling down his face. He wiped them away with the back of his hand and after a while, he muttered, "You said you would use sweet words on me, but it was actually you. Be honest, do you want to make me fall deeply in love with you so that you can marry another empress?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded. "Yes, I plan to marry another empress named Jiang Lan. Just as her name suggests, she is abnormally lazy. She even has a cat named Jiang Qin, who is more active than she is."</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help but correct him: "His name is Schue Gou. His real name is Schue Gou, and his nickname is Schue Tuanzi. He is not called Jiang Qin. I allowed him to use your surname because you truly have a throne to inherit."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan softly apologized to him: "...I'm sorry."</p><p>"I shouldn't have lied to you, nor should I have always been short-tempered with you."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "If you don't want to be with me, who else do you want to be with?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "I was just talking randomly, I didn't really not want to be with you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>What a good question; he couldn't answer it.</p><p>Jiang Juan was stumped and could only stare blankly at Xue Fangli. His eyes were still red from crying, his nose tip slightly reddened, and he looked up at him with a pitiful yet adorable expression.</p><p>"You don't need to apologize to me," Xue Fangli said, "It's right for you to be angry with me; I have indeed been lying to you all along."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan and slowly promised: "I will try my best not to lie to you anymore in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated but then told the truth, "Actually, I wasn't that angry because I lied to you too. At that time, I was just... "</p><p>"Just afraid you would punish me."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan lowered his head guiltily. This whole incident was actually a strategic preemptive move on his part. Jiang Juan felt uneasy and cautiously asked: "You weren't angry, were you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Knowing he had done something wrong, Jiang Juan hugged Xue Fangli's neck and asked him, "Why aren't you talking?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Silence, long silence.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt something was amiss. The next moment, Xue Fangli walked to the soft bed, laid Jiang Juan down, and Jiang Juan tried to crawl away, but his ankle was suddenly grabbed, pulling him back. Then Xue Fangli leaned in close.</p><p>"Are you that angry? Afraid I'll punish you?"</p><p>"If so, today I really must give you a proper punishment for all those times I spared you because I pitied your weak body and didn't dare touch you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Why did he have to say so much?</p><p>And—</p><p>Wasn't being a person bad?!</p>
