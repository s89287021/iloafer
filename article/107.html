						<p>Everything happened quickly. From the onset of dizziness to Jiang Juan falling into a coma, it was but an instant.</p><p>Before collapsing, Jiang Juan fell into someone's arms; Xue Fangli picked him up and called out his name repeatedly.</p><p>"Jiang Juan."</p><p>"… Jiang Juan."</p><p>"Jiang Juan!"</p><p>No response.</p><p>"Brother Juan—!"</p><p>Witnessing Jiang Juan faint, Xue Congjun almost instinctively rushed over. Behind him, Meng Qingliang and Gu Puwang also followed, pausing only briefly when they realized something was amiss.</p><p>Jiang Juan lay in Xue Fangli's arms, his crimson robe billowing like spilled rouge, scattering all around him. In this sea of chaos, he seemed lifeless.</p><p>Xue Fangli shouted, "Physician!"</p><p>As his fingers touched the pulse, he waited for a moment before exclaiming with surprise, visibly anxious. He switched to Jiang Juan's other hand, but not long after, he switched back again, breaking into a sweat.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "What happened to him?"</p><p>Doctor Sun moved his lips, saying, "Reporting to the emperor, the empress…"</p><p>Doctor Sun bowed heavily and said with fear, "There are no abnormalities in the pulse."</p><p>"Is there no abnormality?"</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him intently, his aura icy cold, and his expression difficult to read. "No abnormality? Could it be that he simply fell asleep?"</p><p>Sun Taishi did not dare to speak, pressing his forehead tightly against the ground, barely daring to breathe.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and stood up, speaking in a voice as cold as ice. </p><p>"Summon everyone from the Imperial Medical Institute."</p><p>With this, the sudden incident forced the coronation ceremony to be halted.</p><p>Xue Congjun asked blankly, "What's wrong with Brother Juan? Has his heart ailment flared up?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said, "If his heart ailment had flared up, wouldn't it have been diagnosed?"</p><p>Gu Puwang remained silent, only watching as Xue Fangli carried Jiang Juan into the sedan chair. After a while, he said, "Go and take a look."</p><p>Before Gu Puwang and Jiang Qingliang could take more than a few steps, Xue Congjun finally showed some caution. "Don't go; I'll go. My fifth brother is looking very grim right now. If he's annoyed with me, the worst he can do is punish me. But you guys are unpredictable."</p><p>Going to see Jiang Juan might not be appropriate for Gu Puwang and Jiang Qingliang. After a moment of thought, Gu Puwang said to Xue Congjun, "If you go, try to stay calm."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "...Understood."</p><p>Fainting during the coronation ceremony was no small matter. The medical practitioners hurriedly arrived at the scene, their breath still uneven as they began to diagnose Jiang Juan.</p><p>Sun Taishi was the most experienced and senior physician in the Imperial Medical Institute. Even he said there was no abnormality, let alone any other physicians.</p><p>Similar to Sun Taishi's earlier examination, the physician diagnosing Jiang Juan this time also frowned tightly, wiping sweat from his brow repeatedly. No matter how he looked at it, the pulse seemed to be—</p><p>"What's going on with him."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked calmly, but the veins on his hand that he had wrapped around Jiang Juan's were bulging, and bloodshot eyes filled with danger beneath this calmness.</p><p>The imperial physician shuddered, words almost at his lips, yet he dared not speak honestly. He stammered, "M-majesty, let this subject consult with my colleagues... before saying anything?"</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed once, without any discernible emotion.</p><p>The imperial physician stepped out of the sedan chair, and in a short while, his clothes were soaked in sweat. However, he did not care about these trivial matters; he urgently sought help from his colleagues who worked at the Imperial Hospital.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>A thud, as his fingers pounded on the low table, Xue Fangli's impatience reached its peak. In reality, very little time had passed; this physician had not even spoken a few words with his colleagues.</p><p>No matter how they put it, if there were no abnormalities in the pulse, then there were no abnormalities. Sticking one's neck out would lead to death, and shrinking back would also result in punishment. The imperial physician finally took a deep breath, trembling with fear as he spoke to Xue Fangli, "Reporting to Majesty—"</p><p>"Perhaps this subject is not skilled enough; the Empress Consort's pulse shows no abnormalities. Her fainting may be due to recent fatigue, why not... wait and see?"</p><p>The imperial physician's voice was uncertain. After listening, Xue Fangli repeated, "Wait and see?"</p><p>He laughed once, his anger uncontainable. Xue Fangli no longer hid his emotions; he said with a vicious expression, "The Imperial Hospital truly breeds a bunch of useless people!"</p><p>"Get lost, all of you get lost!"</p><p>When told to leave, the staff at the Imperial Hospital did not dare stay behind. They all bowed their heads and literally rolled away in fear.</p><p>Xue Fangli watched indifferently as his long-absent headache returned. His fury began to rise again, without any way to calm it down.</p><p>In the past, as long as Jiang Juan was around, everything would settle down, but this time, everything had been triggered by him.</p><p>"Majesty..."</p><p>Wang Zongguan cautiously said, "Why not have this servant immediately summon all the doctors in the capital into the palace? If the Imperial Hospital is no good, perhaps these doctors can find some clues?"</p><p>Xue Fangli shut his eyes, "Transmission."</p><p>Wang Zongguan bowed and hurried to go about it, but had only taken a few steps when Xue Fangli spoke again, stopping him.</p><p>"Ananda."</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was cold, "Order immediately that they find a monk named Ananda."</p><p>This Ananda had said that Jiang Juan's life had three calamities and mentioned his unstable spirit and soul.</p><p>After hearing this, Xue Fangli had once sent people to look for Ananda but came up empty-handed. This time, with Jiang Juan fainting out of the blue, he was determined to find him.</p><p>"Today I will dig through the earth even if it means digging three feet deep to find this monk for me."</p><p>Xue Fangli enunciated each word heavily, filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Whether they were tricking or there was something to it, Jiang Juan's condition was ultimately related to him.</p><p>Wang Zongguan did not know the reason but did not ask further. Having received Xue Fangli's order, he carried it out, "Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p>Knowing how important Jiang Juan was, Wang Zongguan dared not delay and almost ran all the way, quickly disappearing from sight.</p><p>Xue Fangli withdrew his gaze to rest on Jiang Juan's face. He slowly lowered his head, burying himself in Jiang Juan's neck, and amidst the faint scent, Xue Fangli's frustration only grew stronger.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli said again, "Leave the palace, go to Zha'an Temple."</p><p>He did not believe in ghosts or gods, but rather than letting Jiang Juan sleep unconscious, he was willing to visit a temple.</p><p>Perhaps it was a coincidence, but upon arriving at Zha'an Temple, which had been bustling with visitors in the past, the gate was now tightly closed and there were barely any pilgrims. Only one monk sweeping up fallen leaves could be seen before the door.</p><p>The guard reported, "Your Majesty, today is the memorial day for Great Master Lianwu. The abbot and the monks of Zha'an Temple went up the mountain to pay their respects together, so Zha'an Temple is not open to visitors."</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the temple. A few months ago, he had visited this temple, but today it was in ruins, with its buildings dismantled into shambles.</p><p>After asking the nearby villagers, the guard said with trembling fear, "Your Majesty, Miaoling Temple is currently under renovation and cannot be entered."</p><p>Xue Fangli then said, "GuiBao Temple."</p><p>Every temple had been bustling with incense every day, but today, on this particular day, when Xue Fangli arrived at GuiBao Temple carrying Jiang Juan, the main gate was shut tightly, and no deities were to be seen.</p><p>"Your Majesty, all the monks of GuiBao Temple went out begging for alms together recently."</p><p>"Guilin Temple is off-limits; its abbot passed away last night."</p><p>"We cannot enter today as Jingtih Temple has no visitors."</p><p>...</p><p>They almost walked through every temple in the capital, but by the end, none were open. Xue Fangli laughed, his body surging with a bloody aura, his appearance terrifying to behold.</p><p>With deities unseen, they could certainly force their way in.</p><p>Bodhisattvas fear causes, while beings fear effects1, he did not fear evil consequences, only that such consequences would befall the youth.</p><p>He was also afraid...</p><p>The youth would wake up and argue with him.</p><p>The youth had a kind heart; if he knew Xue Fangli was causing trouble again, it would only make him unhappy.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his fingers caressing Jiang Juan's face, "Where did you lose your soul?"</p><p>"Forget what I said?"</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>Jiang Juan lay in his arms, unusually quiet. His breathing was shallow, and his heartbeat weak, as if it were just another ordinary day; he had simply slept in a bit too much and hadn't woken up yet, hence unable to respond.</p><p>Staring at him for a long time, Xue Fangli recalled a place.</p><p>There was a pagoda dedicated to housing relics. If one's heart held a wish, by bowing all the way to the top floor, a true Buddha would manifest and grant that wish.</p><p>He had no desires of his own; he only wished for one person's well-being.</p><p>"Mirror Flower Pagoda."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Go to the Mirror Flower Pagoda."</p><p>The pagoda towered high, reaching thirty-seven floors. Last time, Jiang Juan met Anan here and was also pushed down the stairs from this place.</p><p>Having someone watch over Jiang Juan, Xue Fangli stepped into the pagoda.</p><p>"Fifth Brother! Fifth Brother!"</p><p>Xue Congjun followed him all along, feeling increasingly perplexed, unsure why Xue Fangli had headed straight for the temple. Now seeing him enter the pagoda, he could no longer hold back and hurried after him.</p><p>"Why are you here?"</p><p>"I have a wish."</p><p>Xue Congjun was taken aback, only then recalling that this was the Mirror Flower Pagoda and remembering the legend surrounding it.</p><p>His fifth brother had never believed in ghosts and gods, yet now he wanted to enter the pagoda to kneel and pray. Who could it be for? The answer was glaringly obvious.</p><p>"Fifth Brother, you…"</p><p>If one had a request, they would have to bow all the way up to the highest point. Xue Congjun couldn’t imagine him kneeling in prayer.</p><p>In the palace, when Xue Fanglei went berserk, he didn’t care about anything; he didn’t know what it meant to restrain himself and didn’t bother doing so. He had a touch of arrogance in his very bones and showed no respect to either his grandmother or his father. How could he possibly show respect to these mysterious ghosts and gods?</p><p>Xue Congjun also heard that not long ago, his grandmother had forced Jiang Juan to kneel before her. When Xue Fanglei arrived, he even broke the Buddha statues and plaques she revered.</p><p>Xue Congjun truly couldn’t imagine his fifth brother bowing layer by layer up the pagoda.</p><p>"Fifth Brother, are you really going to bow?"</p><p>Xue Congjun asked him blankly.</p><p>Xue Fanglei shot him a bored glance without responding, simply taking a step inside.</p><p>"…Maybe I’ll pray instead."</p><p>Xue Congjun was serious.</p><p>He couldn’t imagine his fifth brother bowing all the way up and didn’t think it right for his fifth brother to kneel before anyone. There was nothing worth kneeling for.</p><p>"It’s unnecessary. She is my wife, so naturally, I should pray."</p><p>While Xue Fanglei shouldn’t kneel before anyone and there was nothing worth kneeling for, if one were to put it that way, he didn’t even believe in ghosts and gods, thinking it was all pretense. That day, he still visited many temples and ended up at this Buddha pagoda.</p><p>Because of Jiang Juan.</p><p>Because a monk said Jiang Juan’s spirit was unstable.</p><p>He feared that Jiang Juan would lose her soul and fall into a perpetual sleep.</p><p>He feared that Jiang Juan would abandon him.</p><p>Anyone in this world could leave him, go away, but not Jiang Juan.</p><p>For his entire life, he would trample on dignity, kneel to every deity, forcing her to stay with him.</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his robe and slowly knelt down on the ground.</p><p>A few hours earlier, he had been at the coronation ceremony, the young emperor receiving the adoration of thousands.</p><p>At this moment, Xue Fangli was still wearing that flamboyant black-gold attire, its layers of pleats rich and magnificent, yet he was kneeling on a dilapidated staircase.</p><p>His back straight, his face expressionless as he bowed down, tapping his head to the ground.</p><p>"…Big Brother."</p><p>Xue Congjun found this painful to watch. He opened his mouth but did not know how to stop him.</p><p>Xue Fangli was his big brother, Jiang Juan was his weary brother. They were truly the best in the world. Since Xue Congjun could not stop him, he simply knelt alongside Xue Fangli.</p><p>From the first floor to the seventeenth, a bow with each step, kneeling at every level, from dawn till dusk, and then from dusk till dawn again. Xue Fangli's head pounded with pain, yet each step, each bow, was sincere until he reached the seventeenth floor of Jinghua Tower.</p><p>With pale fingers clutching the railing, Xue Fangli slowly stood up.</p><p>Golden characters inscribed the name of the master.</p><p>—Ānán.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked for a moment, perhaps due to a headache or anger overwhelming his heart, a few streaks of blood appeared at the corner of his lips. He wiped them away slowly and smiled indifferently, "Putting on an act, making things mysterious."</p><p>"If that's true, I won't be able to find you?"</p><p>It took a lot of time to reach layer three-seventeen through prostration, but exiting the pagoda did not take so long. Xue Fangli stepped out of Jinghua Tower and abruptly lifted the curtain, only to find the young man still sleeping peacefully without any sign of waking up.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Did you find Ananda?"</p><p>The guard replied, "We are still looking."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, his body filled with malevolence, "Destroy all the temples in the capital and arrest the monks as well."</p><p>Wantonly destroying temples and killing monks was no different from a large-scale massacre. The guard was greatly alarmed but could only agree, "...Yes."</p><p>Soon, the imperial guards were mobilized in the capital, and the sounds of destruction never ceased. The tightly closed gates were kicked open, and the monks were bound and taken away one after another, their cries for mercy echoing continuously.</p><p>"Did you hear that?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan and smiled slightly, "If you are angry, stop me. As long as you tell me what to do, I will stop."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not move.</p><p>Xue Fangli continued, "I am destroying temples and killing innocents. If karma really exists, I naturally won't let you off; you must share the consequences with me."</p><p>Jiang Juan still did not move.</p><p>In front of Jiang Juan, Xue Fangli was usually gentle, his malevolence and agitation completely concealed. However, at this moment, Xue Fangli could no longer restrain himself. He looked at Jiang Juan, his expression fierce, "Do you really forget what you promised me?"</p><p>"You said——you would not abandon me."</p><p>Xue Fangli tightly gripped Jiang Juan's wrist and suddenly pulled him into his arms with great force, as if he wanted to crush Jiang Juan's body. Throughout this, Jiang Juan remained calm; he did not cry out in pain nor shed tears. He was still asleep, unaware of everything.</p><p>"Then go to hell with me."</p><p>After a long pause, Xue Fangli spoke slowly and gently, his tone almost soothing, while outside the carriage was a bound monk.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his crimson lips, his voice cold as ice, "If Ananda does not appear for a moment, I will kill one person; if he does not appear for an hour, I will kill ten. I will continue killing until he appears!"</p><p>The guards followed orders, pushed a monk forward, pinned him to the ground, unsheathed their long swords, raised them high above their heads, about to strike down—</p><p>"I'll take you somewhere."</p><p>A timid voice rang out. A dirty little hand lifted the curtain, and the young monk nervously looked at Xue Fangli, speaking to him from beside the window.</p><p>The young monk glanced at Jiang Juan and said, "I like this brother; he gave me this."</p><p>As he spoke, the young monk raised his hand, in which he clutched a silver coin.</p><p>If Jiang Juan had been awake, he would have naturally recognized that this young monk was the same one Ananda had led last time.</p><p>And the broken silver coin in the young monk's hand was what Jiang Juan had given him when he did not yet know the old monk's identity and thought the monk was hungry but unreliable.</p>
