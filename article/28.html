						<p>Xue Fali was taken aback.</p><p>Jiang Juan's tears were so plentiful, whether rolling onto the pillow, freezing on his eyelashes, or trickling through his hair, each tear seemed to land on Xue Fali's heart.</p><p>There was no weight to them; they floated down, burning with shock.</p><p>It shouldn't be like this.</p><p>Xue Fali lowered his head and stared at Jiang Juan for a long time.</p><p>He had imagined many possibilities. The youth might try to persuade him to let go of his resentment or be afraid of his ferocity, but he neither said nor asked anything, only quietly taking back the incense.</p><p>"Why?" Xue Fali asked.</p><p>"Your Excellency must have your reasons for hating her..." Jiang Juan replied dejectedly.</p><p>Xue Fali's thoughts and the waves caused by his words were all unknown to Jiang Juan; he had an almost blind faith in Xue Fali.</p><p>——Your Excellency is good. But whenever Your Excellency doesn't act like a good person but more like something bad, it must be that the other party has issues.</p><p>Jiang Juan added, "I trust only Your Excellency."</p><p>Saying this, Jiang Juan's eyes filled with tears as he looked down, feeling incredibly unlucky.</p><p>His foot injury hadn't fully healed, and on top of that, he was hurt. At the same time, acupuncture needles were being inserted into his back to unblock his meridians.</p><p>It hurt like hell; Jiang Juan gasped in pain. Xue Fali watched him for a long time before reaching out with clear fingers to wipe away his tears and embrace him.</p><p>Jiang Juan feared acupuncture, but the pain from his injury masked the pricks of the needles. He was still blowing on his injured finger when the abbot finished the acupuncture and asked softly, "Your Excellency, should I also treat the burn on Your Consort's hand?"</p><p>Xue Fali nodded and extended Jiang Juan's injured finger.</p><p>Jiang Juan was held up by him, and this time he dared not look. He obediently buried his face in Xue Fangli's arms, er... even if he didn't look, the pain still objectively existed.</p><p>Every time the pain came, zhe... fingers would zhe... want to clench onto something, completely a conscious action. Xue Fangli glanced at him ying, used some force, forcing Jiang Juan to relax his zhe... fingers.</p><p>Unable to clench zhe... fingers, he could only endure it. However, letting Jiang Juan endure the pain was really too difficult. Not a moment passed before he couldn't bear it anymore, and Jiang Juan bit down on his right zhe... knuckle.</p><p>Ying, a pale and slender finger pinched his ying cheek, Xue Fangli lowered his ying head, "Bite."</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him. Seeing this, Xue Fangli forced him to raise his head, and his zhe... fingers also probed into Jiang Juan's mouth.</p><p>He wanted to push out Jiang Juan's zhe... finger, but Jiang Juan felt uncomfortable, resisted fiercely, and his tongue was also trying to push him away. Wet marks appeared on Xue Fangli's fingertips.</p><p>He paused for a moment, and the subsequent actions almost bordered on dominance. Xue Fangli stirred continuously inside Jiang Juan's mouth, finally making him give up on biting his own knuckle.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help but feel miserable. He raised his head to look at Xue Fangli ying, his expression was simply one of grievance. He then ying bit down on Xue Fangli's zhe... finger.</p><p>This moment almost overlapped with a dream.</p><p>In the dream, the youth wasn't just bare-backed; he clung to Xue Fangli's chest, his skin soft and smooth, his brows filled with vibrant color, dazzling beyond compare.</p><p>At this moment, the youth was in his arms, looking up at Xue Fangli. His ying tail was blushing, water droplets still clinging to the tips of his eyelashes, his pained cries muffled and unclear.</p><p>"Pain... wu..."</p><p>It sounded like a sob, a cat-like voice.</p><p>The finger contained in his mouth nearly got soaked as Jiang Juan bit heavily. Xue Fangli only felt itchy.</p><p>The youth's hair spread out again, piled on his round shoulders, pressing against his fair neck. Xue Fangli used the other zhe... hand to tuck it to one side.</p><p>His black hair was slowly brushed away, revealing a red mole at the nape of his neck.</p><p>Colorless and boundless, captivating and soul-stealing.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at it for a long time, his finger almost touching it. The abbot finished treating Jiang Juan's injury and raised his head: "Alright."</p><p>He suddenly came back to his senses, still holding his finger out, but only picked up a lock of fallen black hair, brushing it to the other side.</p><p>The abbot said, "It's about time, I'll remove the needles for the Empress."</p><p>There was still some pain during the needle insertion, but removing them felt like nothing at all. The abbot quickly removed all the silver needles and instructed, "Empress, avoid using your left side for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He bitterly let out Xue Fangli's finger, nodded, and Xue Fangli placed his palm on Jiang Juan's nape, gently kneading a few times, suddenly stopping.</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, "What's wrong with his back?"</p><p>On the exposed part of Jiang Juan's back, it was smooth and white like porcelain covered in a thin layer resembling cicada wings, but now there were bruises near his protruding shoulder blades.</p><p>The abbot looked over, "It's fine, just that Empress has delicate flesh. If it doesn't disappear in a few days, heat therapy for a few days will do."</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed.</p><p>After the abbot finished needling and bandaging Jiang Juan, there was nothing more to be done. He packed away his medical kit, bid Xue Fangli farewell, and Xue Fangli nodded.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't see his back, so he had to touch it himself. It wasn't painful if he didn't touch it, but touching it caused him pain and made him stiffen.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Don't touch."</p><p>Jiang Juan was utterly despairing, "Why does everything hurt?"</p><p>"Yes, why does everything hurt," Xue Fangli looked at him, "how pitiful you are."</p><p>Jiang Juan lay dejectedly on Xue Fangli's shoulder, his gaze lowering to suddenly see Xue Fangli’s hand. He touched the bite marks on his own flesh and asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, does it hurt?"</p><p>It doesn't hurt; it just feels itchy.</p><p>Xue Fangli was about to answer but upon meeting Jiang Juan's concerned look, the words that came out were different, "Not really painful."</p><p>If not really painful, then it means it does hurt. Jiang Juan was very annoyed. He grabbed Xue Fangli’s hand and gently rubbed it for him, "...I’m sorry."</p><p>Xue Fangli let himself be rubbed, smiling to accept Jiang Juan's guilt.</p><p>But in his heart, a voice murmured softly.</p><p>—Not enough, far from enough. He wanted him to be softer.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, unsure how long passed before he asked Jiang Juan, "Do you want to know...how she...?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned but quickly realized that the "she" referred to by His Highness was Yu Mengxuan. He hesitated and asked, "Can I?"</p><p>"If you don't want to, it's fine."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with a casual smile, "There's nothing stopping you."</p><p>After all, it would make the youth more sympathetic towards him.</p><p>"It was her..."</p><p>On many nights in the past, during his excruciating headaches, and amidst those brief nightmares, Xue Fangli often revisited that day.</p><p>His hand had a dagger, one end embedded in his palm while the other pierced through the woman's chest.</p><p>The woman held Xue Fangli’s hand, pushing it forcefully into her body. The thin and sharp blade squeezed out drops of crimson blood. Her red lips curved slightly as she softly murmured with a voice that sent chills down the woman's spine.</p><p>"Li, after you leave, you will go to hell."</p><p>"You lie and break your promises. Your tongue will be pulled out; I cannot escape your clutches, so each of your fingers will be cut off one by one. You eat my flesh, drink my blood, kill me, and you will be thrown into a pool of blood to drown repeatedly."</p><p>"I want to watch you. Watch you leave, watch you go to hell, watch you never find salvation..."</p><p>Xue Li smelled that odor.</p><p>The mixture of the smell of blood and faint rose perfume was revolting, making one feel nauseous.</p><p>The line between the past and reality blurred gradually. His vision turned red, Xue Li's expression grew cold, and his pale back was covered in veins.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>Jiang Juan noticed something amiss and hurriedly came over, tugging on Xue Li's sleeves several times.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Juan was close enough to smell the herbal scent clearly. He didn't feel anything about it, but to Xue Li, it was extraordinary.</p><p>Amidst a dense stench of blood, he smelled a faint fragrance of herbs.</p><p>This odor was barely noticeable, yet it penetrated Xue Li's nostrils, surrounded him, and brought him back to his senses.</p><p>The boundary between hell and nausea was a mere breath apart.</p><p>Xue Li slowly lowered his eyes.</p><p>He suddenly changed his mind, not wanting to reveal the full truth to the young man.</p><p>It was easy to imagine how the young man would react.</p><p>——He would furrow his brow, look at him with pity-filled eyes, then sympathetically mutter, "Why is she like this?"</p><p>It only caused heartache.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not mention Yuwen Zhiruo holding his wrist and stabbing him with a dagger, merely calmly saying, "She had lived enough; she took her own life."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. "Then why blame the Prince?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Perhaps because she dismissed everyone and took her own life in front of the Wang."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, "Ah," quickly realizing something. He stared at Xue Fangli for a long time before suddenly hugging him.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, "What?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head without speaking and asked him after a while with a muffled voice, "Prince, were you afraid then?"</p><p>"Fear?"</p><p>Xue Fangli gave a light snort. He pinched Jiang Juan's chin, raised his face, and said regretfully, "I don't remember."</p><p>"You're lying."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, staring at Jiang Juan leisurely.</p><p>The youth's expression was extremely sad, his heart full of pain and pity that seemed almost unbearable. He stared intently at Xue Fangli, and this focus undoubtedly pleased Xue Fangli to no end.</p><p>He curled the corners of his mouth into a smile, gently touching Jiang Juan's face with tenderness. Deep within him was an extremely wicked thought.</p><p>——Something that could make the youth even more hurt.</p><p>But right then, the tips of his fingers touched a wet spot on Jiang Juan's face.</p><p>Warm, damp.</p><p>Xue Fangli was stunned and looked over. Jiang Juan's eyes were filled with tears, and as her eyelashes flickered, water droplets fell one by one.</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>"I think you're afraid."</p><p>Jiang Juan hugged Xue Fangli again. He wasn't good at comforting people verbally, so he kept repeating, "It doesn't matter, it's all over now."</p><p>The person in his arms hugged him tightly. Xue Fangli lowered the curtain slightly, looking at the finger marks soaked with water.</p><p>Was he afraid?</p><p>Xue Fangli asked himself.</p><p>Since birth, he had never been expected to succeed. He was just a pawn, expected to be a weakness, but that woman named him "Fangli" for him.</p><p>She insisted on it.</p><p>She had no weaknesses.</p><p>Perhaps he was afraid once, but he had forgotten.</p><p>Over the years, he had feared nothing. He was just a madman who cared about nothing and didn't fear losing anything because he had nothing to lose.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan for a long time before finally smiling lightly, "Why are you crying like this? Sadder than even King Wang?"</p><p>He raised one hand, placing it on Jiang Juan's waist, gradually tightening his grip.</p><p>The shoulder was soaked with wetness. The teenager hugged him tightly.</p><p>Warm and damp.</p><p>Xue Fangli was taken aback and looked over. Tears welled up in Jiang Juan's eyes, and as her eyelashes flickered, water droplets fell one by one.</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>"I think you're afraid."</p><p>Jiang Juan hugged Xue Fangli again. He wasn't skilled at verbal comfort, so he kept repeating, "It doesn't matter, it's all over now."</p><p>The person in his arms held him tightly. Xue Fangli lowered the curtain slightly, looking at the finger marks soaked with water.</p><p>Was he afraid?</p><p>Xue Fangli asked himself.</p><p>Since birth, he had never been expected to succeed.

The teenager hugged him tightly.</p><p>Warm and damp.</p><p>Xue Fangli was taken aback as he looked over. Tears welled up in Jiang Juan's eyes, and with each flicker of her eyelashes, water droplets fell one by one.</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>"I think you're afraid."</p><p>Jiang Juan hugged Xue Fangli again. He wasn't skilled at verbal comfort, so he kept repeating, "It doesn't matter; it's all over now."</p><p>The person in his arms held him tightly. Xue Fangli lowered the curtain slightly, gazing at the finger marks soaked with water.</p><p>Was he afraid?</p><p>Xue Fangli wondered.</p><p>Since birth, he had never been expected to succeed.

The teenager hugged him tightly.</p><p>Xue Fangli was both regretful that she hadn't made Jiang Juan more heartbroken and relieved that she hadn't done so.</p>
