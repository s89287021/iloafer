						<p>After much effort, Secretary Jiang and Jian Nian arrived at the villa and left their visiting cards. High Official Gu hurriedly invited them inside and personally poured tea for them before saying politely, "I have already sent someone to ask for Lady Wang's permission. Secretary Jiang and Young Master Jia, please wait a moment."</p><p>Secretary Jiang nodded gracefully and lifted his teacup without saying anything further. Jian Nian, on the other hand, knew High Official Gu's position. Seeing that he was still hosting guests, Jian Nian could hardly believe it but had no choice but to accept the reality.</p><p>——Li Wang has not been involved in an incident.</p><p>Seeing Jian Nian looking at him, High Official Gu smiled and asked, "Has Young Master Jia any instructions?"</p><p>Jian Nian first shook his head, thought for a moment, and then asked High Official Gu, "Sir, how did Lady Wang get injured?"</p><p>Jian Nian's eyes were filled with worry, and his expression did not seem to be fake. Seeing this, High Official Gu merely smiled and spoke vaguely, "There was an accident."</p><p>He had served Lord Wang for so many years and was quite skilled in reading people. This Young Master Jia seemed sincerely concerned on the surface, but there was not a trace of genuine worry.</p><p>However...</p><p>Wasn't this Second Son of the Secretary's House supposed to be the so-called number one beauty of the capital?</p><p>High Official Gu examined him silently for a moment. He did look handsome and fair, but compared to their Lady Wang, it was like an insult to humanity.</p><p>Isn't "heavenly beauty" and "beauty" an insult to "humanity"?</p><p>Though High Official Gu was somewhat wicked in nature, he did not show it on his face. After hearing his words, Jian Nian hesitated for a moment before asking, "...Could it be because my younger brother is naive and angered Lord Wang?"</p><p>What kind of temper Li Wang had, how could Jian Nian not know? The first thing that came to his mind when Secretary Jiang mentioned that Jiang Juan was injured was that Li Wang was responsible. Moreover, High Official Gu's reluctance to talk about the matter only confirmed it.</p><p>In a previous life, Li Wang had treated him the same way and almost killed him with this man.</p><p>Jian Nian paused for a moment before saying guiltily, "My younger brother has been living in the countryside since childhood, recovering from illness. He was only recently brought back to the capital, so he does not understand many things and did not mean to anger Lord Wang deliberately."</p><p>Eunuch Official: "?"</p><p>The Empress Dowager's injuries have nothing to do with the Prince.</p><p>Not to mention how indulgent the Prince has always been towards the Empress Dowager, this time it was she who saved his life. No matter how tyrannical the Prince may be, he would not repay kindness with enmity.</p><p>Eunuch Official helplessly said: "Second Young Master, you are overthinking."</p><p>Jiang Nian just smiled but remained convinced that Jiang Juan was injured by King Li.</p><p>Perhaps the outcome for King Li has changed, but a person's temperament cannot be altered. He is and always will be that kind of man.</p><p>Tyrannical, sinister, unpredictable in mood.</p><p>In his previous life, Jiang Nian suffered day and night, filled with fear and anxiety.</p><p>In this life, Jiang Juan suffers day and night, filled with fear and anxiety.</p><p>Jiang Nian lifted her teacup and took a sip of tea.</p><p>How pitiful.</p><p>The servant reporting the news did not return for a long time. Seeing that Secretary Jiang was starting to get impatient, Eunuch Official said: "Lord Jiang and Second Young Master, please stay a bit longer. I'll go check."</p><p>Secretary Jiang had other matters to attend to later and urged him: "Hurry up."</p><p>As a result, Eunuch Official did not return.</p><p>"What nonsense!"</p><p>About an hour later, Secretary Jiang could no longer hold it in. He slammed his teacup onto the table and said angrily, "How can a son make his father wait? Coming to see him with good intentions only to give us a rude welcome."</p><p>Jiang Nian also thought that Jiang Juan was being too excessive. He frowned but tried to calm Secretary Jiang down, saying, "Father, don't be angry. Perhaps he was held up by something."</p><p>Secretary Jiang snorted coldly, "I think his wings have grown hard!"</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan felt quite innocent; he really did not mean to make Secretary Jiang and Jiang Nian wait.</p><p>He had fallen asleep again only at dawn. When the servant first reported this, Jiang Juan didn't hear what was said clearly and mumbled, "I want to sleep."</p><p>The servant hesitated and looked towards Xue Fangli, who replied calmly, "Tell them to wait."</p><p>Being woken up once made it difficult for him to fall asleep again. Jiang Juan woke up several times before finally sitting up from the maiden's bed.</p><p>"Is there anything?"</p><p>Jiang Juan vaguely remembered someone telling him something earlier. Feeling extremely tired, he asked, having not slept well all night, his entire body lacked energy.</p><p>At this moment, the chief steward had returned and was waiting for Jiang Juan to wake up. Seeing that he was awake, he smiled and said, "Sir Jiang and Young Master Two are here to see you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... Who?"</p><p>The chief steward repeated, "Sir Jiang and Young Master Two are currently waiting for you."</p><p>So this was the moment when the main character was being treated unfairly?</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent for a while before hugging his thin blanket tightly in a pitiful and helpless manner. He asked the chief steward, "How long have they been waiting?"</p><p>"About an hour."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>A time period.</p><p>Did he offend the protagonist again after pushing someone into the lake?</p><p>Jiang Juan asked desperately, "Why wasn't I fully awakened?"</p><p>Gao Guoshi glanced at Xue Fangli. Seeing this, Jiang Juan turned his head curiously. He had taken up the bed, and the man leaned against it reading an ancient book without lifting his eyes, "There's no need."</p><p>Alright.</p><p>Jiang Juan could only reluctantly accept the reality.</p><p>Gao Guoshi asked him, "Your Highness, do you want to meet Lord Jiang and Second Young Master now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. He then went to fetch someone over, while Lan Ting hurriedly prepared Jiang Juan for the meeting.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan still felt it was improper.</p><p>He had been raised with strict etiquette and did not have the habit of receiving guests while sitting on a bed. Jiang Juan lowered his head and looked down, intending to put on his shoes so he could sit properly. Before his feet even touched the ground, someone held his shoulder firmly.</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around, Xue Fangli frowned at him and asked, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "Just sitting up."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "You can't get out of bed."</p><p>Jiang Juan argued, "I'm just sitting up; it doesn't count as getting out of bed, right?"</p><p>How could that not be? The moment his feet touched the ground, he would have to exert force. Xue Fangli asked him, "Don't you fear pain?"</p><p>"...Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan woke up a little, but he really felt it was impolite. He struggled with this in his mind. Xue Fangli looked at him for a few moments and suddenly asked, "Just want to sit up?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "This King knows."</p><p>Knew what?</p><p>What did the Prince know?</p><p>Jiang Juan was still puzzled when Xue Fangli reached out to wrap his waist. In the next moment, Xue Fangli sat down, and Jiang Juan was pulled into his lap.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>He looked up in shock.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze, his expression unchanged as he said, "You are sitting up."</p><p>Jiang Juan said blankly, "...But I wanted to sit up myself."</p><p>Holding him like this must be even more impolite than when he was lying on the couch and seeing people!</p><p>"Feeling pain if you put your feet down," Xue Fangli lowered his head; the other person's breath tickled his nose. He closed his eyes and said lazily, "Would have to comfort you if you cried, troublesome."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I didn't..."</p><p>Before he could finish saying the words "to comfort," Jiang Juan held back. He remembered when Xue Fangli consoled him last night while treating his wound because he was in too much pain.</p><p>Jiang Juan could only change the subject: "This is really troublesome, you don't have to take care of me."</p><p>Xue Fangli opened his eyes and looked at him with a smile, saying leisurely, "No trouble. The Princess Consort saved this King's life; this King will repay your kindness."</p><p>Jiang Juan stirred slightly but found it impolite to do so. He wrestled with the dilemma in his mind. Xue Fangli glanced at him a few times and then suddenly asked, "Just want to sit up?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "This King understands."</p><p>Understood what?</p><p>What did the Prince understand?</p><p>While Jiang Juan was still puzzled, Xue Fangli reached out to wrap his waist. In an instant, Xue Fangli sat down, and Jiang Juan was lifted into his lap.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??" </p><p>He looked up in shock.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze with a calm expression and said, "You are sitting up."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded blankly, "...But I wanted to sit up on my own."</p><p>Holding him like this was even more impolite than lying on the couch and greeting people!</p><p>"Putting your feet down will hurt," Xue Fangli lowered his head, inhaling Jiang Juan's breath. He closed his eyes and said casually, "I'd have to comfort you if you cried; it would be troublesome."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I didn't..."</p><p>Before he could finish saying "to comfort," Jiang Juan stopped speaking. He recalled how Xue Fangli had consoled him last night when treating his painful wound.</p><p>Jiang Juan changed the subject, "This is really troublesome; you don't have to take care of me."</p><p>Xue Fangli opened his eyes and looked at Jiang Juan with a smile, saying leisurely, "No trouble. The Princess Consort saved this King's life; I will repay your kindness."</p><p>Jiang Juan stirred slightly but felt it was impolite to do so, creating an internal struggle. Xue Fangli glanced at him a few times and then suddenly asked, "Just want to sit up?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yeah."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded in acknowledgment, "This King understands."</p><p>Understood what?</p><p>What did the Prince understand?</p><p>While Jiang Juan was still puzzled, Xue Fangli reached out and wrapped his waist. In an instant, Xue Fangli sat down, pulling Jiang Juan into his lap.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??" </p><p>He looked up in shock.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze with a composed expression and said, "You are sitting up."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded blankly, "...But I wanted to sit up on my own."</p><p>Holding him like this was even more impolite than lying on the couch and greeting people!</p><p>"Landing your feet will hurt," Xue Fangli lowered his head, inhaling Jiang Juan's breath. He closed his eyes and said casually, "I'd have to comfort you if you cried; it would be troublesome."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I didn't..."</p><p>Before he could finish saying "to comfort," Jiang Juan stopped speaking. He recalled how Xue Fangli had consoled him last night when treating his painful wound.</p><p>Jiang Juan changed the subject, "This is really troublesome; you don't have to take care of me."</p><p>Xue Fangli opened his eyes and looked at Jiang Juan with a smile, saying leisurely, "No trouble. The Princess Consort saved this King's life; I will repay your kindness."</p><p>Jiang Juan said earnestly, "I am so heavy; sitting for a long time will make you uncomfortable."</p><p>"Not at all," Xue Fangli smiled gently, looking as clear and bright as the moon after rain, "It's fine."</p><p>In fact, it was still too light.</p><p>He should be taken good care of in the future.</p><p>Xue Fangli thought absentmindedly.</p><p>However, holding the young man in his arms felt quite nice.</p><p>People are soft, and their scent is sweet.</p><p>After listening to this, Jiang Juan was at a loss for words for a moment. He stared blankly for some time before he suddenly realized and pushed Xue Fangli away.</p><p>In the flurry of movement, Jiang Juan's elbow accidentally hit something, causing Xue Fangli to cough lightly. Jiang Juan jumped in fright and immediately stopped moving.</p><p>"Are you alright?" Jiang Juan asked cautiously.</p><p>Xue Fangli was about to say he was fine, but his gaze met Jiang Juan's worried eyes.</p><p>The young man had been resisting sitting in his arms at first, but now he submitted completely, no longer struggling.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids. After a moment, he said casually, "It's nothing major."</p><p>Since it's not major, then there must be something wrong, thought Jiang Juan. He grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve anxiously and asked, "Did you cough up blood again?"</p><p>Xue Fangli was taken aback. He hadn't expected Jiang Juan to remember about him coughing up blood; he had just mentioned it casually back then. Nonetheless, Xue Fangli replied vaguely, "It's fine."</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan really dared not move anymore. He decided that if he was going to be held, he might as well go along with it.</p><p>However...</p><p>The Prince's health was truly poor, coughing up blood at the slightest provocation.</p><p>And since it had come to coughing up blood, it must be quite severe. No wonder he said his days were numbered.</p><p>Jiang Juan pondered for a few seconds and decided to be nicer to the Prince in the future.</p><p>End-of-life care was something he excelled at.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time with a careless smile.</p><p>Little Bodhisattva is truly Little Bodhisattva, with such a soft heart and so easy to manipulate.</p><p>When Jiang Shushan and Jiang Nian entered the pavilion, they saw this scene.</p><p>The young man was being held in his arms. Xue Fangli's posture was relaxed, one hand loosely around the young man's waist, looking down at him as he said something. The young man, with his head lowered, was looking at the fruit platter in front of him.</p><p>Jiang Nian's footsteps halted, and his eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>This is Li Wang?</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>Why would he hold someone in his arms? Why would he treat people with such kindness?</p><p>He was clearly an evil spirit, with a cold heart that found joy in trampling on others' sincerity.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Nian's breathing became unstable.</p><p>In his previous life, he had feared Li Wang, but he also deeply admired him.</p><p>At the time of the arranged marriage, Jiang Nian's heart was filled with joy. He firmly believed that no matter how tyrannical and cruel King Li was, he could soften him and gain a place by his side.</p><p>However, it didn't work out. Reality slapped him hard in the face.</p><p>Before the wedding, regardless of what he did, this man wouldn't even give him a glance. Even during the wedding ceremony, the man merely lifted his crimson lips to sneer faintly.</p><p>"This is the First Beauty of the Capital? Merely so."</p><p>He hated King Li.</p><p>He had refused Duke Pingan for him, but his dignity was trampled underfoot by the king. In the end, it all came to nothing, and he could only watch helplessly as Duke Pingan ascended to the throne as emperor.</p><p>Jiang Nian fiercely pinched his palm, the pain pulling him away from the hatred of his previous life. He struggled to regain some semblance of reason and examined the person in Xue Fangli's arms expressionlessly.</p><p>The man had quite a talent; he even managed to capture King Li's heart.</p><p>The other man lowered his head, making it impossible to see his face. Jiang Nian had an inexplicable guess, but immediately dismissed it as unlikely. His younger brother was timid and cowardly, completely different from this man's demeanor.</p><p>So, where was Jiang Juan?</p><p>Weren't they here to meet Jiang Juan?</p><p>While he thought about it, Jiang Nian regained his composure and said to the high official, "Your Highness, Prince Consort, Lord Jiang and Second Young Master have arrived."</p><p>As soon as the words were out, the young man heard the voice and lifted his head, meeting Jiang Nian's gaze directly. Jiang Nian was stunned once more.</p><p>He was Jiang Juan!?</p>
