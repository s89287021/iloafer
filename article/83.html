						<p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>A hoarse voice sounded beside him. Jiang Juan came to his senses and asked softly, "Your Highness, are you injured?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Is it because of this bite?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "No."</p><p>"The smell on your body seems like blood too."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow and leisurely asked Jiang Juan, "Didn't I raise a cat? How did it become a dog?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was bewildered, "A dog?"</p><p>Xue Fangli slightly smiled. In the next moment, Jiang Juan was held in his arms, lying on top of him. His slender and tanned fingers slowly stroked the naked back of the young man. Xue Fangli's voice was sultry, "I've been smelling this ever since you came back."</p><p>"What? Are you afraid I'm hugging someone else?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... Not at all."</p><p>It was because Your Highness insisted on hugging him that Jiang Juan smelled an unusual odor. He was familiar with the breath of Your Highness, and suddenly there was a strange smell added to it. Of course, he had to be cautious.</p><p>"You're the dog."</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered angrily. Xue Fangli just smiled, wrapped his arms around Jiang Juan's shoulders, and probed toward his heart area again. Jiang Juan immediately pressed down on this mischievous hand, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You keep complaining about pain in your heart and asking me to rub it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I'm not in pain now, don't touch it."</p><p>He finally realized the situation and stopped giving Your Highness an opportunity to take advantage of him. However, Jiang Juan was distracted again; he remembered that he didn't need Your Highness to massage his heart but forgot to investigate where that bloody smell came from.</p><p>"Do not move."</p><p>Grabbing the hand that was placed on his chest, Jiang Juan playfully tugged at Xue Fangli's fingers. He slowly said, "I want to get my bargain back."</p><p>How to get it back, Jiang Juan thought for a moment, raised his head, and asked for a kiss, "Your Highness, kiss me again."</p><p>He really did get his bargain back. Xue Fangli lowered his head to kiss him, but Jiang Juan quickly used his palm to block him, "I still have something to say."</p><p>"You must not touch me randomly or take off my clothes."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a "hum" and casually grabbed his chin. Whether he touched him randomly or took off his clothes, Jiang Juan was unaware of it as they kissed on and on. However, when he was held in his arms, he was nearly naked.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Losing his sight seemed to make his senses even more acute.</p><p>First, the hand was put down, then he left the familiar embrace. A short while later, Jiang Juan woke up.</p><p>"… Your Highness?"</p><p>"Somebody from the palace has arrived. His Excellency is going to see him."</p><p>Gao Zongguan stood beside him and answered respectfully. Then, Lanting walked over and pulled back the curtains, "Young Master, you're awake?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly nodded. Lanting asked if he wanted some food.</p><p>Jiang Juan actually still wanted to sleep, but since His Excellency was not there, with someone holding him, Jiang Juan felt a bit scared. He thought for a moment and decided to wait until His Excellency returned before continuing to sleep. He said, "Okay."</p><p>Lanting immediately went to prepare the breakfast. Gao Zhengshi stood beside him; Xue Fangli had instructed him to look after the person. Seeing Jiang Juan slowly sit up, Gao Zhengshi couldn't help but remark, "Your Highness—Princess Consort, thank heavens you are unharmed. These few days, everyone in the mansion has been living in fear."</p><p>He suddenly spoke, and Jiang Juan was startled, "Gao Zhengshi, is it you?"</p><p>Eunuch: "Servant."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Oh," and then asked him, "Why were you trembling in fear?"</p><p>The investiture of the Crown Prince was supposed to be a good thing. Who knew that within a few hours, when the Duke returned, he had become the Crown Prince, but he carried back an injured Crown Princess.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into a three-day coma, during which Xue Fangli also guarded him for three days. During these three days, everyone in the mansion was on edge because Xue Fangli radiated coldness and his eyes were red, as if he had returned to the time of his manic episodes. However, this time it was an enduring madness.</p><p>—As long as Jiang Juan did not wake up, he would remain mad for another day.</p><p>After some time, the main culprit was brought into the mansion.</p><p>The eunuch said with a bitter smile, "His Highness's anger has finally been vented."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan realized belatedly and asked, "Who pushed me?"</p><p>The eunuch replied, "Criminal Minister Shilang Li Shilang."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "That Li person?"</p><p>He was not entirely sure how to match the position with the person. The eunuch thought for a moment and said to Jiang Juan, "Does the Crown Princess remember when you went to a brothel with His Highness in the past and encountered a man named Li Ming who committed an act of violence there?"</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered this incident. "Yeah, I remember him."</p><p>The eunuch: "Li Shilang is his father. When Li Ming committed an act of violence at the brothel and spoke disrespectfully to you, the Emperor ordered his execution. Li Shilang then harbored resentment towards you and His Highness."</p><p>"This time, when that Li person was being invested as Crown Prince, he said your origins and conduct were unsuitable for a Crown Princess. After the Emperor cleared you, he privately summoned that Li person and asked him to resign from his position. That Li person..."</p><p>"Followed you all the way and pushed you."</p><p>Actually, this matter goes beyond that.</p><p>Pushing Jiang Juan was indeed Li Shilang's extreme hatred, but the words spoken during his title conferral were prompted by someone. After all, even Xiangdu had been tampered with, and the chief official heard that many people were implicated, including some influential figures—such as Crown Prince, Princess Mei, Vice Chancellor Li, etc.</p><p>However, regardless of their status, he was certain that none of them would be spared.</p><p>To say the least, this was the first time the chief official felt relieved that His Highness had ruthless methods. After all, the Empress Dowager Consort had suffered greatly, and the chief official comforted Jiang Juan, "Empress Dowager Consort, rest assured. The grievances you have endured will be avenged one by one by His Highness."</p><p>Setting aside the others, Li Shilang, who initiated this, was truly tormented beyond human or ghostly recognition.</p><p>"That man Li—"</p><p>Li Shilang's teeth were pulled out, his hands amputated, and he desperately pleaded for mercy, but His Highness refused. Day by day, his life hung in the balance as he watched himself being tortured piece by piece until mutilated beyond recognition, with not a single inch of flesh left unscathed.</p><p>The chief official was about to mention Jiang Juan when Jiang turned her head, her young eyes dull yet pure, as if any further human filth would be profane.</p><p>Jiang pressed, "What happened to him?"</p><p>The chief official paused, coming back to his senses. He wouldn't dare speak recklessly; although His Highness interrogated Li for the sake of the Empress Dowager Consort, the methods were too brutal for her to hear.</p><p>"His Highness interrogated him," the chief official vaguely replied.</p><p>Jiang exclaimed, "So Your Excellency spent all day yesterday interrogating him?"</p><p>The chief official said, "Presumably."</p><p>Jiang furrowed her brow in confusion.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>Why would the Prince interrogate Li and then deceive Jiang into his quarters?</p><p>The stench of blood on the Prince's body, did he get it during the interrogation?</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't make sense of it. He pursed his lips and said, "Prince… why didn’t you tell me?"</p><p>The High Steward said something, but he only chuckled a bit, "Princess Consort is recuperating, His Highness doesn’t want to worry you."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn’t comforted at all; instead, he became even more preoccupied with the matter.</p><p>He felt that the Prince was afraid of his soft heart.</p><p>The Prince always joked about Jiang Juan's compassionate nature. Jiang Juan suspected that it was because if he found out, the Prince wouldn't allow further interrogations anymore.</p><p>But he wasn’t like that. Jiang Juan decided to clear his name and next time the Prince mentioned having something to do, he would insist on going along.</p><p>Just as he made this decision, Lanting had someone bring a meal. Before Jiang Juan could even sit down, a maid ran over, "Princess Consort… The Sixth Prince, Mr. Jiang, and Mr. Gu have arrived."</p><p>How did they come?</p><p>The High Steward asked Jiang Juan, "Do you wish to see them?"</p><p>Since he was idle anyway, Jiang Juan said, "Sure."</p><p>In the past, when Jiang Juan had meals, Xue Fangli would feed him if she were present; if not, Jiang Juan would rarely call on Lanting. But now that wasn’t possible since he couldn’t see a thing, so he had to trouble Lanting.</p><p>When Xue Congjun and the others were brought over, they just happened to see Jiang Juan being fed. The young man sat quietly there, his clean fingers gripping the armrest of the soft bed. For every spoonful Lanting offered, he took one bite; the whole person was incredibly obedient.</p><p>"Brother Juan."</p><p>Xue Congjun called out. Jiang Qingliang was more direct and ran to Jiang Juan's side, waving his hand around. But Jiang Juan didn’t react at all. Seeing this, Jiang Qingliang said in surprise, "You really can't see anything, huh?"</p><p>"Yeah, I can't see anything."</p><p>Jiang Juan said calmly, "But it should be fine in a few days; it's just temporary."</p><p>"That's good to hear."</p><p>Meng Qingliang said as he glanced at Lanting. His hand was itching to help, but he tried to restrain himself.</p><p>How long could he hold back? Jiang Juan's lips touched the porridge, and Lanting got up to fetch a napkin. By the time she put down the bowl, Meng Qingliang had already reached out with both hands.</p><p>Meng Qingliang wasn't the only one itching to help; Xue Congjun was eager as well.</p><p>——Brother Juan eats so obediently, I really want to try feeding him.</p><p>The two of them each grabbed one side of the bowl. Xue Congjun tugged forcefully toward himself and spoke first, "What are you doing grabbing Brother Juan's bowl? Are you crazy?"</p><p>Meng Qingliang rolled his eyes, "You're the one who's crazy. His maid isn't around to help, so I thought I'd lend a hand to prevent the porridge from getting cold."</p><p>Xue Congjun glared at him, "You always meddle in other people's business. Does Brother Juan need your help?"</p><p>Meng Qingliang saw through his act immediately, "If he doesn't want my help, does that mean he wants yours?"</p><p>Xue Congjun said, "I don't know if he needs help or not, but even if the porridge gets cold, he won't need you to feed him a mouthful!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "……"</p><p>They ended up arguing over something so trivial; it was really hard to understand. Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "Spare my porridge; it's innocent."</p><p>Meng Qingliang glared at Xue Congjun, "Did you hear that? Brother Juan told you to let go."</p><p>Xue Congjun said angrily, "Why aren't you letting go?"</p><p>Meng Qingliang replied, "Brother Juan can't see, and he's the one who called me 'daddy.' What's wrong with showing a little filial piety toward my father?"</p><p>Xue Congjun stared in disbelief, "You bitch—can't you have some decency?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had no choice but to use his trump card: "...If you don't let go, I'll tell the Prince."</p><p>With a bang, the bowl was put down. Whether it was Xue Congjun or Jiang Qingliang, they all released their grip and dared not be too unruly anymore. Jiang Juan felt for the bowl and muttered, "The Prince is really useful."</p><p>Xue Congjun turned pale upon hearing this. Jiang Qingliang dared to be angry but did not dare to speak; after all, they had both been persecuted before.</p><p>Lan Ting hadn't returned yet, and the porridge was indeed getting cold. So Jiang Juan decided to eat it himself, though he had to try several times before he could successfully place the spoon in the bowl.</p><p>They were off again, with the spoon clanging against the bowl rim. Seeing how the two were having trouble, Gu Puwang reached out to help Jiang Juan put the spoon back in the bowl and said, "Eat."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit embarrassed, "Thank you."</p><p>Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang exchanged glances, realizing something was amiss. Sure enough, after helping Jiang Juan a few times with the spoon, Gu Puwang calmly stated, "I'll help you."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment. After taking over, Gu Puwang did indeed feed him one spoonful at a time—though in his heart, he thought that Jiang Juan eating on his own was quite cute. However, he still maintained some distance, lifting the porridge bowl and letting Jiang Juan drink it himself.</p><p>This worked much better. Jiang Juan happily accepted his help and showed his gratitude, "Thank you."</p><p>Gu Puwang smiled, "You don't need to thank me."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>What is this?</p><p>The bickering clams benefit the cunning gull.</p><p>Xue Congjun and Jiang Qingliang glared at Gu Puwang and silently cursed him, "Gu Puwang, you really are—"</p><p>"Too cunning!"</p><p>Though Gu Puwang was not pleased, he leisurely chatted with Jiang Juan about his recent well-being. "In a few days, I will be entering the service of the court."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, "So soon?"</p><p>Gu Puwang replied, "Fortunately, my father registered me for the imperial sacrifice at the beginning of the year."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Qingliang was not to be outdone and said, "Brother Juan, I am also heading to the military camp."</p><p>He truly could not pronounce that name properly, so it was better to directly go to the military camp for training. After some time, his father finally agreed.</p><p>The plot had indeed reached its latter stages.</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered from the novel that the Princess and her husband disapproved of the main character and thus had reservations about Duke Ping of An as well. As for General Jiang and Chancellor Gu, their attitudes toward the main character and Duke Ping of An were lukewarm at best. However, after Gu Puwang entered service and Jiang Qingliang joined the military, with their help, the main character and Duke Ping of An were ultimately accepted by General Jiang and Chancellor Gu.</p><p>They went into service, he into the military, Xue Congjun pondered for a moment and felt that she could not lag behind. Reluctantly, she said, "Brother Juan, do you lack any treasures to play with? I see that Mother Empress has obtained some good items. Perhaps I can steal them for you one day."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Thank you, but it's unnecessary."</p><p>As they were speaking, Lan Ting finally returned. Xue Congjun had visited a few times before, so Lan Ting remembered him. Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang were first-timers, however, and Lan Ting took this opportunity to look them over. When her gaze fell on Gu Puwang’s face, she exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"You...”</p><p>Gu Puwang looked at her, and Lan Ting muttered, "Sir, you are very kind."</p><p>"Were you here around Luofeng Mountain five years ago?"</p><p>Gu Puwang was startled and nodded: "Correct."</p><p>Lan Ting said uncertainly, "Then did you encounter bandits who held you hostage and were later rescued by our master—the local villagers?"</p><p>Gu Puwang was indeed kidnapped, but he had a high fever at the time and his memory was foggy. The only thing he remembered clearly was waking up in an abandoned temple, with a friendly-looking teenager using the back of his hand to check Gu's temperature and gently saying, "You're awake?"</p><p>"I'm Jiang Nian. It seems you were kidnapped. I had someone rescue you."</p>
