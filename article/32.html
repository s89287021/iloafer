						<p>This string of sandalwood Buddha beads, having been venerated in Zhaoan Temple for many years, is lustrous and translucent, imbued with the scent of incense. It symbolizes the removal of karmic obstacles.</p><p>Jiang Juan is usually pristine. His body resembles a bodhi tree, his mind like a clear mirror, as if he might ascend at any moment without a second thought.</p><p>But now, Jiang Juan lies on a soft couch, writhing in pain due to some injury, his entire body covered in damp vapor and emitting an inexplicably sweet and sticky odor.</p><p>And the sandalwood bracelet on his ankle—representing sanctity and tranquility—clings to his fair skin and curled toes, inexplicably exuding a hint of decadence.</p><p>At this moment, the youth is no longer that dust-free little Bodhisattva. He is himself in peril, being dragged into the mire of worldly desires by the Buddha beads, a karmic obstacle.</p><p>He was born to be a karmic obstacle.</p><p>Not wishing to cross the sea of suffering, he insists on leading others into the sea of desire.</p><p>"Prince, are you done?"</p><p>Xue Fangli had been motionless for a long time, and Jiang Juan could not help but ask. Xue Fangli stared at his ankle, his fingertips touching his empty wrist as if feeling something.</p><p>—He held onto this section of the ankle.</p><p>Slim and fragile, it would leave finger marks even without any force applied to it.</p><p>What if he squeezed tightly?</p><p>In Meiling Temple, all his myriad desires finally became clear at this moment.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>No one responded. Jiang Juan turned around and locked eyes with Xue Fangli, whose dark gaze was inscrutable.</p><p>There were many things Jiang Juan did not understand about him, but he was certain that the Prince had no ill intentions towards him, so he did not feel afraid, merely continuing to speak on his own: "Are you done?"</p><p>He sat up slowly, meticulously arranging his clothes. He gently played with the small leaf sandalwood bracelet on his ankle.</p><p>His dark hair tumbled over his shoulders as Jiang Juan lightly complained, "No wonder my ankles are sore, they got pinched. Your Highness, you..."</p><p>He pulled the bracelet upwards; the beads pressed against the tender skin, leaving smooth red marks.</p><p>Why did everything leave marks on him?</p><p>Xue Fangli extended a hand toward him and stroked Jiang Juan's ankle. The sensation matched his memory. He lowered his eyes, almost involuntarily wanting to press harder—</p><p>"It tickles."</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly pulled back his foot, looking innocent at Xue Fangli. It was he who had pinched his ankles, and it was he who didn't want to be touched much.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked into his eyes; Jiang Juan's pain subsided, and the damp feeling around him lessened. His gaze was clean, and his demeanor pure.</p><p>No karmic debts, no desires—nothing clouded his mind.</p><p>He was meant to save others but ended up entangling them in karmic debts, yet he remained unaware and indifferent.</p><p>How hateful.</p><p>Better if he made him cry in pain.</p><p>Even if he didn't care anymore, he could only seek comfort in his embrace, with tear-stained eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, suppressing the madness and agitation deep within his soul, and restrained himself from saying, "Rest well. Call for food when you're hungry."</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "Your Highness, what about you?"</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>He sat up slowly, carefully arranging his clothes and gently fiddling with the small leaf sandalwood bracelet on his ankle.</p><p>His dark hair cascaded over his shoulders as Jiang Juan softly complained, “No wonder my ankles are sore; they got pinched. Your Highness, you...”</p><p>He pulled the bracelet upward, causing the beads to press against his tender skin and leave smooth red marks.</p><p>Why did everything leave marks on him?</p><p>Xue Fangli reached out a hand and stroked Jiang Juan's ankle. The sensation was familiar. He lowered his eyes, almost involuntarily wanting to press harder—</p><p>“It tickles.”</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly pulled back his foot, looking innocent at Xue Fangli. It was he who had pinched his ankles, and it was he who didn't want to be touched much.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze; Jiang Juan's pain subsided, and the damp feeling around him lessened. His gaze was pure, and his demeanor spotless.</p><p>No karmic debts, no desires—nothing clouded his mind.</p><p>He was meant to save others but ended up entangling them in karmic debts, yet he remained unaware and indifferent.</p><p>How hateful.</p><p>Better if he made him cry in pain.</p><p>Even if he didn't care anymore, he could only seek comfort in his embrace, with tear-stained eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, suppressing the madness and agitation deep within his soul, and restrained himself from saying, “Rest well. Call for food when you're hungry.”</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, “Your Highness, what about you?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>He sat up slowly, carefully arranging his clothes and gently fiddling with the small leaf sandalwood bracelet on his ankle.</p><p>His dark hair cascaded over his shoulders as Jiang Juan softly complained, "No wonder my ankles are sore; they got pinched. Your Highness, you..."</p><p>He pulled the bracelet upward, causing the beads to press against his tender skin and leave smooth red marks.</p><p>Why did everything leave marks on him?</p><p>Xue Fangli reached out a hand and stroked Jiang Juan's ankle. The sensation was familiar. He lowered his eyes, almost involuntarily wanting to press harder—</p><p>"It tickles."</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly pulled back his foot, looking innocent at Xue Fangli. It was he who had pinched his ankles, and it was he who didn't want to be touched much.</p><p>Xue Fangli met his gaze; Jiang Juan's pain subsided, and the damp feeling around him lessened.

Call for food when you're hungry."</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "Your Highness, what about you?"</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>Xue Fangli said lightly, "Two words." He was about to leave but suddenly spoke again, "Your foot injury is no longer a problem; you can resume the medicinal bath."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed, "Ah," as taking a medicinal bath took a long time, he just wanted to take his bath and go to sleep early. "Resume it tomorrow."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "When you returned, you were still being playful with this Wang, saying that you were very sick and couldn't lift anything."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He hadn't been playing at the time; he had just been explaining.</p><p>But did the Prince misunderstand something again?</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated to speak. What could he say? But it was something that happened before he entered this world, so there was no way to clarify. Jiang Juan could only admit it.</p><p>First a medicinal bath, then a bath, after all this tossing and turning, Jiang Juan was already drowsy. When he lay back on the bed, Lanting rushed over from another estate.</p><p>She hurriedly dried his hair for him, but Jiang Juan shook his head, "Forget it, it takes too long to dry completely; just wipe me down."</p><p>Lanting refused, "No, Young Master, you'll catch a cold if you're not properly dried."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only hug the pillow and let her dry his hair.</p><p>He had slept on this bed for one night; it was very hard. Now there were plenty of soft silks on top, making it much softer to touch. However, after sleeping in Xue Fangli's arms several times, no matter how soft it was, it didn't compare to the Prince's comfort.</p><p>Maintaining a constant temperature and a sense of security inside his arms; he was forced to be a pillow every day but could take the opportunity to snuggle back.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help asking, "Where is the Prince?"</p><p>Lanting replied, "The Prince is resting in the Cool Breeze Pavilion."</p><p>Alright then, without the Prince there's no Prince. Jiang Juan felt a bit disappointed for a moment before lying down again, after all, the bed was soft enough for him to sleep well.</p><p>Xue Fanglei, however, could not sleep well, and even failed to fall asleep.</p><p>In the Cool Breeze Courtyard, the singer softly hummed a light melody.</p><p>Amidst the layers of gauze curtains, Xue Fanglei leaned on a soft bed. He had just taken a bath, his black hair still wet, with dark stains on his shoulders. However, he did not care at all and merely picked up the golden cup to drink wine.</p><p>He had not used any fragrances for a long time. The scent filled the room, but the effect was negligible. Like countless nights before, Xue Fanglei spent his sleepless nights in boredom.</p><p>He could only truly fall asleep for a few nights, all of which were with Jiang Juan, breathing in the sweet fragrance emanating from him and sleeping peacefully.</p><p>The young man had a well-proportioned body; it was particularly comfortable to hold him.</p><p>If he were here, he could pull him into his arms. Just by lowering his head, he could savor the scent at the base of his neck.</p><p>However—</p><p>"Lust towards people is like holding a torch against the wind; one must inevitably burn their hands and suffer."</p><p>Xue Fanglei slowly opened his mouth, his expression filled with annoyance.</p><p>He did not fear burning his hands.</p><p>What he feared was losing Jiang Juan. Ultimately ending up with the same fate as Emperor Hongxing.</p><p>Because of attachment, because of obsession, because of barriers, because of demons.</p><p>Pitiful and laughable.</p><p>His mind agitated, both irritability and hidden pain surged over him. Xue Fanglei drowsily pressed his Guanyan point, and a "creak" sounded—his chief eunuch was back.</p><p>"Your Highness, the Emperor said that although there are several summer retreats, it is not as refreshing as staying in the palace pavilion. When the weather gets hot, you should stay in the pavilion with Princess Consort."</p><p>Xue Fali bowed his head, seemingly not feeling that staying in the imperial palace was an honor or privilege, but rather a matter of utmost ordinary routine.</p><p>High Erics hesitated for a few seconds before whispering, "Your Majesty seems quite pleased to see you. He mentioned this is your first time asking him for something."</p><p>Xue Fali did not respond further. High Erics observed him closely and continued, "Prince Wang, Your Majesty also instructed you to visit the palace again tomorrow."</p><p>After a brief pause, High Erics added, "When I left, I saw Mr. Li from the Ministry of Punishments kneeling outside the Yanchixin Palace. Perhaps he is here regarding today's incident."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Xue Fali responded indifferently, taking out a sachet from his sleeve.</p><p>High Erics glanced at it; he had a strong impression of this sachet. After all, while it was clearly in Prince Wang's possession, he had still made him pretend to lose the sachet and request another one from the princess consort.</p><p>"They are all fragrances. How can I like just one person's scent? It is simply that I enjoy it."</p><p>Xue Fali lowered his eyes, as if asking High Erics or perhaps himself.</p><p>Flattery was something High Erics excelled at. He had two eyes, not just for show; previously, he thought Prince Wang showed considerable indulgence toward the princess consort, but now he felt otherwise.</p><p>Our Prince Wang has fallen hard.</p><p>This is not a princess consort; she is clearly a demon consort.</p><p>"This indicates that the prince consort and Prince Wang are a pair made for each other," High Erics stated. "The princess consort has pure intentions and treats Prince Wang extremely well. Prince Wang enjoys her scent, and doesn't the princess consort also like Prince Wang?"</p><p>Xue Fali asked with mild interest, "According to you, what does the princess consort like about this prince?"</p><p>High Erics paused for a few seconds before responding calmly, "...The princess consort likes that Prince Wang is a good person."</p><p>Xue Fangli gave a light sneer, looking at Guo Geshi with ridicule. When Guo Geshi met his cold gaze, he hurriedly lowered his head.</p><p>The Empress Dowager could say the Prince was a good man three times in a day, but every time the Prince heard it, he didn't look like this; instead, he would even act as if everything was perfect to please the Empress Dowager.</p><p>Guo Geshi was still slandering when Xue Fangli said, "Has the Empress Dowager gone to sleep yet?"</p><p>Guo Geshi replied, "Yes."</p><p>Not long after, Guo Geshi returned again and said, "My Prince, the Empress Dowager has already slept for several hours."</p><p>Pausing slightly, sensing that the Prince would be pleased, Guo Geshi added, "Before she went to sleep, the Empress Dowager asked where you were, My Prince."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and, feeling weary, lowered his eyelids. "Get out."</p><p>Guo Geshi got the order and hurriedly ran out. Xue Fangli thought about Guo Geshi's words and chuckled softly.</p><p>Yes, he was a “good man.”</p><p>The young boy let him hold and hug him, willing to sleep in his arms, never putting up any defenses against him.</p><p>What was he restraining?</p><p>After hearing so much praise, did he truly think of himself as such a good person?</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Before dawn, Jiang Juan was awakened by someone shouting.</p><p>"Young Master, Young Master—"</p><p>In response to the call from Lan Ting, Jiang Juan reluctantly opened his eyes. The canopy was pulled aside by a pale hand, and Xue Fangli looked down at him and said, "Come with this Prince into the palace."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>It was still dark outside. Ever since he started working, Jiang Juan had slept until mid-morning each day, without the nurse's rounds to wake him up. At this hour, it was impossible for him to move.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I don't want to."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You do."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke slowly: "But I want to sleep more."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly: "Sleep in the carriage."</p><p>Could a carriage be as comfortable as a bed?</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, turned over, and strongly resisted waking up. Xue Fangli glanced at him a few times, pulled back the thin blanket, and directly lifted Jiang Juan into a sitting position, then said to Lanting, "Get him ready."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Even though the Prince was a bit pitiful, making him start work so early seemed a bit too much.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I don't——"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "You can sleep."</p><p>How could he sleep now? Jiang Juan lifted his head and gazed at Xue Fangli with an enigmatic expression.</p><p>But Xue Fangli ignored this, lowering his head instead to inhale the scent emanating from Jiang Juan's body. The anger and hostility accumulated over the night were pacified in that moment.</p><p>It was simply because the young man sat in his arms, because he was infatuated with the fragrance of the young man.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not happily wash or change into his clothes; even the whole salty fish seemed to wilt from having to start work too early.</p><p>Xue Fali gazed at him, and not long after, he casually opened his mouth: "If you don't want to enter the palace anymore, then forget it."</p><p>Jiang Juan's spirit lifted, and he immediately said: "Then I..."</p><p>"You remember that this king reported to the authorities yesterday," Xue Fali, "but the Duke of Anping insisted that it was this king who committed the crime."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, hmm, hmm, huh, "Mm-hmm."</p><p>Xue Fali lowered his eyes, "The father of the person accused of committing the crime entered the palace last night to demand an explanation from His Majesty and also believed it was this king's fault."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan exclaimed "Ah," and his heart softened again.</p><p>"It's too much," Jiang Juan frowned, "Your Highness clearly had good intentions; why did they all misunderstand you?"</p><p>Xue Fali calmly said: "This king is already used to it."</p><p>Hearing him say that, Jiang Juan felt even more pitiful for him. He sighed and affectionately said: "Forget it, Your Highness, I'll accompany you into the palace."</p><p>Xue Fali asked: "Aren't you going to sleep?"</p><p>Even the saltiest fish couldn't lie flat now, Jiang Juan said: "I can sleep on the way."</p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p>Xue Fali had a smile playing at the corners of his lips and gently said: "Since it's such a long journey, you can sleep in this king's arms."</p>
