						<p>After asking, Jiang Juan's fingers clenched the spread brocade quilt, pulling out a crease. He felt somewhat nervous in his heart.</p><p>He lowered his head; perhaps he had rubbed it against the railing, half-parting and half-binding his hair. His fair neck was also partially covered. Under the dim firelight, everything seemed hazy, like a beauty painted on gossamer, soft enough to wrinkle at a touch and melt away with a pinch.</p><p>"Do you really want to play or not?"</p><p>Xue Fangli had been silent for a long time. Jiang Juan's heart pounded violently. This kind of 'play' was different from his usual pranks. He felt quite embarrassed, but without an answer, he also became slightly furious and ashamed.</p><p>"If you don't want to—"</p><p>Before the words "calculated" could be spoken, dizziness hit him, and Jiang Juan suddenly found himself pinned to the bed. Clear joints held his chin firmly in place. Xue Fangli's gaze was lowered, with a dangerous smile, "Do you want to play with your fingers?"</p><p>"Where do I play?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched several times. "Last time... where you played."</p><p>Xue Fangli pretended ignorance: "Huh? Where did you play last time?"</p><p>"There were too many places we played; I can't remember."</p><p>Jiang Juan's gaze wandered everywhere, knowing he was feigning innocence. He tried to push Xue Fangli's hand away. "You don't even know where to play. You're useless."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan with a smile that was neither approving nor disapproving for a few moments before leaning towards him as if about to kiss him, but not quite managing it.</p><p>His fingers gently brushed the black hair piled on Jiang Juan's shoulder and rubbed the red mole on his neck. His voice was seductive: "Here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent. His hand moved down again, seemingly aiming to massage Jiang Juan's chest, but his fingertip touched something else instead. "Here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's fine eyelashes flickered, his eyes moist, but he still did not speak.</p><p>Soon, his waist was grabbed. That slender and supple section of waist was always Xue Fangli's favorite.</p><p>"Here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was buried in the brocade quilt, shaking his head randomly. His dark hair spread out, completely covering his face with a rosy hue.</p><p>Seeing his denial, this hand began to cause more trouble than before.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Juan's eyes widened, and Xue Fangli lowered his gaze, smiling carelessly, "Is it here?"</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli moved his fingers slightly, "Or is it here?"</p><p>"Not..."</p><p>He asked Jiang Juan, who naturally had to give a polite refusal.</p><p>"Not?"</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him, saying with a hint of disappointment, "In that case, forget it."</p><p>As he spoke, it seemed as if he was about to retract his hand. Jiang Juan felt extremely uncomfortable and didn't want him to leave, almost instinctively clenching his legs together.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's attempt to retain Xue Fangli made the latter quite pleased, but he remained calm and asked, "What's wrong? Didn't you say you couldn't play here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wouldn't admit it, "...I didn't."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a few moments before finally kissing Jiang Juan, but it was only a light, teasing kiss, "You said so."</p><p>This annoying guy was clearly being intentional.</p><p>Jiang Juan licked his lips, feeling quite annoyed inside.</p><p>"Here, you play. Hurry up and play. I'll give you anything to play with."</p><p>Jiang Juan opened her mouth, her voice soft to the point of tenderness.</p><p>Xue Fangli would bully Jiang Juan, and Jiang Juan knew his weakness. Looking at him, she softly called out, "Husband..."</p><p>A mewling sound, sticky and thick, made Xue Fangli pause. Jiang Juan slowly asked him, "Husband, am I not fun enough? Why won't you play?"</p><p>Having asked that, he naturally needed no more pleasantries. Xue Fangli's eyes turned a little vicious.</p><p>...</p><p>Those few calls of "Husband" did allow Jiang Juan to gain an upper hand, but it also caused her to cry for a long time.</p><p>What was supposed to be once turned out not to be just once.</p><p>Xue Fangli even became more demanding.</p><p>After an unknown period, Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched. She shook her head fiercely, resolutely saying, "I don't want this. I don't want it..."</p><p>Xue Fangli kissed her in a comforting manner, his voice hoarse, "I won't touch you."</p><p>Jiang Juan had cried for too long; her eyes and nose were red, with tears hanging on her lashes. She angrily asked, "Is this what you call not touching?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, his lips, a bright crimson, lifting slightly, "This is rubbing."</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The previous emperor passed away, and the new emperor returned to the capital bearing his spirit.</p><p>News of this had long reached the capital. The festive decorations were no longer in sight, replaced by white mourning clothes and spirit flags, creating a sea of white as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Gu Yunzhi and Jiang Sen Tao returned to Beijing first, leading the civil and military officials to wait for a long time.</p><p>"Long live His Majesty——!"</p><p>Seeing this young new emperor, all the officials knelt down and greeted him in unison, their voices like thunder.</p><p>Having jolted around in the carriage all night and slept through much of it, Jiang Juan was awakened. He lifted his curtain and glanced outside to see Xue Fanglei receiving homage.</p><p>The man rode ahead on horseback, his robe billowing in the wind, rustling loudly. The golden-threaded phoenix on his robe spread its wings as if about to take flight, shimmering with light. Despite his rosy lips and white teeth, he exuded an oddly cold demeanor, making him seem eerily beautiful.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>Jiang Juan cursed him in his heart.</p><p>He had hardly slept last night, not daring to sleep too deeply, after all, "ceng yī ceng" was a notorious scam. Jiang Juan naturally had to stay alert and cautious, fearing that if he dozed off, he might be deceived into giving in, which would indeed be terrifying.</p><p>It’s way too big; it must hurt a lot.</p><p>Despite his strong resistance, they didn’t reach the final step, but Jiang Juan was still held in his arms for a long time. The inside of his thighs had even been rubbed raw, making him walk awkwardly that morning.</p><p>Fortunately, Xue Fanglei often carried him around, so when he picked up Jiang Juan and put him into the carriage in the morning, no one thought much of it.</p><p>"Rise."</p><p>Xue Fanglei yawned lazily. He glanced sideways but then slowly said, "Prime Minister Li, I didn’t order you to rise. Stay kneeling."</p><p>A shiver ran down Prime Minister Li’s spine.</p><p>His eyelids had been twitching uncontrollably since he arrived to escort the emperor that morning.</p><p>More accurately, for these past few days, Prime Minister Li had felt quite fearful. After all, on the day of the prince's enthronement, he had instructed Li Shilang to speak out in opposition and use the prince's consort’s background as an argument. Not only did his plan fail, but Li Shilang acted on his own initiative and pushed the prince's consort down the stairs!</p><p>If Emperor Xinghong were still alive, his daughter—Mei Fei—might have been able to say a few words. But now that Emperor Xinghong has passed away, not only he but even she relies on this new emperor.</p><p>If he investigates this matter, none of them—not Mei Fei nor the Crown Prince—will be able to escape!</p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xiang's heart turned cold. His forehead was pressed tightly against the ground, and cold sweat dripped down in droplets. The hands supporting him trembled slightly as he waited anxiously for what came next.</p><p>"I heard that you are not very satisfied with my queen?" asked Schue Fangli casually, as if it were just an off-the-cuff remark. But since he mentioned it deliberately, it was certainly more than a casual question.</p><p>"No, no such thing," Li Xiang replied with a forced smile. "It is the old subject's lack of discernment; I did not know that Her Majesty... was..."</p><p>At this point, Li Xiang realized that the new emperor referred to her as "queen." Not every concubine could become queen, after all, the sovereign's intentions were unpredictable. But since the new emperor mentioned it, then this concubine must indeed be the empress!</p><p>This proved how highly Jiang Juan was regarded in his heart!</p><p>Being singled out already made Li Xiang feel extremely panicked, and now with this revelation, cold sweat poured down from his forehead like rain. "It is the old subject's lack of discernment; I did not know that Her Majesty was none other than Mister Bai's daughter. The old subject is truly foolish."</p><p>Li Xiang stammered, "There is no one in the world who can match Her Majesty to Your Majesty, indeed they are a perfect pair made by heaven!"</p><p>He held back his breath and tried his best to flatter her. After hearing this, Schue Fangli seemed pleased and said with interest, "Continue."</p><p>Li Xiang was bewildered and could only grit his teeth and continue, "Her Majesty has an inherently kind nature, while Your Majesty acts decisively. Together, they complement each other perfectly in both character and temperament, bringing great fortune to the state and happiness to the people!"</p><p>Schue Fangli smiled. "Go on."</p><p>Li Xiang: "..."</p><p>"Her Majesty and Your Majesty, you two... you two are truly a perfect match..."</p><p>After much consideration, Li Xiang guessed that the new Emperor probably enjoyed hearing some flattery about his compatibility with the Empress. However, Li Xiang was truly at a loss for words and didn't know how to continue. Xue Fangli waited for a moment before lightly tsking in impatience. Li Xiang shuddered, feeling as though something bad was about to happen.</p><p>With these casual words, he temporarily sent Li Xiang back to his residence, leaving no doubt about his dissatisfaction.</p><p>Li Xiang was stunned. With so many matters to attend to after the new Emperor's ascension, he had been made to stay at home during this time, which clearly meant that he would not be used again in the future. The difficulties of his official career from then on could only be imagined.</p><p>Li Xiang felt immense regret but had no choice but to agree. He said bitterly, "Yes, Your Majesty, I will do my best to write it out."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and finally looked away without glancing at him again, "Depart."</p><p>The procession began moving once more, with the officials who came to pay respects following at the end of the queue. Li Xiang, however, remained kneeling on the ground even after everyone else had left, as Xue Fangli did not allow him to rise and he dared not do so on his own.</p><p>This scene seemed like a mere cleanup by the new Emperor upon returning to the capital, targeting those who had shown disrespect to the Empress. But those with discerning eyes understood that this was also a warning.</p><p>—The Empress is not to be trifled with!</p><p>She is someone he holds close to his heart!</p><p>Only the Empress herself, Jiang Juan, seemed a little bewildered.</p><p>How could she already be the Empress?</p><p>Hadn't she just become the Imperial Consort a short while ago?</p><p>This promotion was too quick, wasn't it?</p><p>With the new Emperor's ascension, he moved into the palace, and so did Jiang Juan.</p><p>However, Xue Fangli had many things to handle and went to the Imperial Library. Jiang Juan went to Xue Fangli's palace from his youth.</p><p>——The Lingguang Palace.</p><p>Jiang Juan had stayed in the palace once before and had wanted to come take a look, but he didn't manage to do so. This time he did come over, but Jiang Juan was too tired to care about exploring Xue Fangli's youth; he flopped onto the bed and almost fell asleep.</p><p>"Good grandson."</p><p>Dazedly, Jiang Juan heard Bai Xuechao calling him. He struggled to open his eyes and found that it was indeed Bai Xuechao who had come.</p><p>"Grandfather."</p><p>Jiang Juan was extremely tired, but Bai Xuechao misunderstood. With a fond expression, he asked, "Didn't you get scared yesterday?"</p><p>He had only gone to Qiulu Mountain for a trip and spent the night there. Who knew that when he returned to the capital, it truly felt like the sky had flipped over. Worried about Jiang Juan, Bai Xuechao immediately rushed over without stopping.</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't really too scared, but he couldn't say he was in good spirits either; he had been played by Xue Fangli. Thus, Jiang Juan could only reply, "... It's still okay."</p><p>Bai Xuechao forced a smile and said, "Sorry, grandfather."</p><p>After learning the entire process of this palace coup, Bai Xuechao really felt guilty.</p><p>Qi Xiuran was someone he had saved, and Princess Chang's conspiracy wasn't entirely without signs either.</p><p>Previously, Qi Xiuran—or rather, Princess Chang—had sent people to Fengqiji Mountain with a letter. While apologizing for the engagement, she also mentioned a few things about Peach Blossom Land and asked Bai Xuechao how he viewed it, even stating her desire to create such a land and hoping for his assistance.</p><p>Bai Xuechao ignored this.</p><p>Later in the capital, Qi Xiuran visited under the guise of Su Feiyue, but Bai Xuechao did not see him, assuming they would understand his intentions.</p><p>Peach Blossom Land was beautiful and joyful, but it was ultimately just a fantasy. Princess Chang wrote about Peach Blossom Land word by word, but Bai Xuechao only saw her hatred, knowing that she simply wanted to seek revenge for Su Feiyue.</p><p>Baixue Chao was already in his seventies or eighties, with one foot already in the coffin. He had experienced too much in his life, but none more painful than when his favorite disciple passed away prematurely.</p><p>His departure was filled with agony and regret.</p><p>He took away all of Baixue Chao's sincerity and passion.</p><p>Not long after, Baixue Chao resigned from his official position in despair and retired to the mountains.</p><p>People called him "Snow Saint," praising him for his noble character and icy soul. Yet, in the end, he was just an ordinary man. When his favorite disciple died, Baixue Chao left in a huff, never to concern himself with worldly matters again.</p><p>Baixue Chao went to Qiu Lu Mountain to visit Su Feiyue.</p><p>He originally intended to go down the mountain and advise Xue Fangli on paying attention to the Princess. However, events unfolded suddenly, and he did not anticipate that the Princess had secretly recruited troops for years.</p><p>Ultimately, it all stemmed from that year when Su Feiyue left, and Baixue Chao accidentally rescued a man who was riddled with arrows from the river.</p><p>Su Feiyue wanted to live, but he died. The man Baixue Chao saved also wished to live, but his fate was sealed due to his identity.</p><p>—Emperor Hongxing wanted him dead, so he had to die.</p><p>At that time, Baixue Chao thought, this is a pitiful soul.</p><p>Following the Princess's suggestion, Baixue Chao entrusted his friend—a famous doctor in Jiangnan—to make him a human face mask.</p><p>From then on, Qi Xiuran was no more, and Su Feiyue fell into despair due to an old case, eventually changing his temperament drastically, living only for pleasure each day.</p><p>That young man full of vigor vanished from the world in another form that year.</p><p>Baixue Chao sighed deeply, "If I had warned him sooner, none of this would have happened..."</p><p>"The Princess, she is truly foolish!"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head, "Even my grandfather didn't think of that."</p><p>Bai Xue Chao gave a bitter smile. The elderly man who had appeared full of energy yesterday now looked somewhat aged, "Good grandson, if anything happens to you, my grandfather..."</p><p>Having experienced the loss of a child, Bai Xue Chao truly did not want to go through it again. Just thinking about it made him break down in tears.</p><p>"My grandfather will never forgive me!"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him and suddenly felt very heartbroken.</p><p>At the beginning of the story, another character with the same name as his had already committed suicide by biting his tongue. Bai Xue Chao did not appear throughout the narrative, except for this single scene.</p><p>—Duke Ping's Consort repeatedly asked to meet Bai Xue Chao, but he never met her.</p><p>How painful must that have been for this old man at the time?</p><p>Jiang Juan hugged him, "Grandfather, I'm fine."</p><p>Bai Xue Chao patted his back and murmured, "It's good you're fine, it's good you're fine."</p><p>He had intended to say something amusing to cheer up the elderly man, but before Jiang Juan could utter a few words, a maid hurried over to report urgently.</p><p>"Consort, Lady Mei Tai Fei and Crown Prince are here to see you. They've set up a feast and invited you to dine with them."</p><p>No sooner had these words fallen from her mouth than another maid arrived.</p><p>"Consort Consort, Lady Ning Tai Fei and the Sixth Prince have also come. They say the lotus flowers in the palace are in bloom and invite you to take a stroll."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>What is Xue Congjun doing?</p><p>This is far from over.</p><p>Before long, a servant girl brought in several cards of visitation, "Empress Empress——! Lord Zhang, Lord Yu, Lord Song, Lord Jiang... are here to request an audience with you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ?? ?"</p><p>He said dazedly, "Why do they want to see me?"</p><p>Although Jiang Juan was unaware of these matters, Baichao Xue understood perfectly. He chuckled, "You have some sense. You know which one between the new emperor and the new empress holds the real power; it’s time you start ingratiating yourself with them."</p>
