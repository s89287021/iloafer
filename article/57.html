						<p>"My husband."</p><p>His heart seemed to skip a beat.</p><p>Why was he shouting 'my husband'? What was there to shout?</p><p>How strange, he didn't want to shout it at all.</p><p>However—</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended to be calm and asked, "Ah? Shout what?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him lazily and muttered two words, "Madame."</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately responded, "Eh... ah?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>His eyes widened suddenly. He had intended to play a trick on the Prince, but instead was tricked by him. Jiang Juan was stunned, staring blankly.</p><p>Xue Fangli parted his red lips and smiled silently again.</p><p>"...You're so annoying."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan turned around and walked away.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, not getting annoyed even as a face full of petals was thrown at him. He simply stretched out his hand to leisurely wipe them away with a look of extreme pleasure on his face, smiling softly.</p><p>Jiang Juan saw him again, and he stopped walking with his back to Xue Fangli, even if he didn't see her, he would still have to manage it, "You're not allowed to laugh."</p><p>"What's so funny?"</p><p>He complained loudly as Xue Fangli slowly approached him, her voice low and resonant, "The closer you get, the bolder you become. You've even dared to interfere with this king's affairs."</p><p>"Who this king sees is none of your business. Whether this king laughs or not is also none of your concern."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to justify himself, "...I was just casually asking, who cares about you?"</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "If you want to know, telling you isn't a problem. But you said it was just a casual question, it seems like you're not really curious anyway, so forget it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>He seemed at a loss for words, even feeling some regret, trying to change his mind. However, the moment Jiang Juan raised his head, he met with the man's amused gaze. He pursed his lips and still held back.</p><p>No way.</p><p>He had been laughed at like this, so he had to hold it in.</p><p>He also cared about his dignity.</p><p>"If you don't want to say, then don't. Anyway, I'm not really curious either."</p><p>This time, there were no petals for Jiang Juan to grab, and he couldn't throw petals at Xue Fangli's face again. Jiang Juan could only lower his head and step on Xue Fangli's shadow one by one.</p><p>Let you laugh.</p><p>Let you not say anything.</p><p>Let me call you Husband.</p><p>Let you shout... Wife.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes trembled, and she also stopped walking for a moment.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli turned around to look at him. Jiang Juan then shook her head as if waking from a dream. He rubbed his burning ears and got into the carriage himself.</p><p>The Prince was really annoying.</p><p>He was truly annoyed.</p><p>Jiang Juan found the atmosphere very strange, strange throughout, but he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong.</p><p>He seriously thought about it for quite some time, and only confirmed one thing.</p><p>Between them, whether something happened or not, it was always the Prince's fault, never his own.</p><p>It was right to blame the Prince.</p><p>The Prince was just annoying.</p><p>When they returned to the Wangfu, it was already late. Lan Ting helped Jiang Juan get ready for bed.</p><p>Indeed, curiosity killed the cat and also caused the salted fish to lose sleep.</p><p>Jiang Juan, who had fallen asleep the moment he laid down, couldn't fall asleep at all. He tossed and turned on the bed but didn't last long before being pulled into someone's arms and held tightly.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"I can't sleep."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>He started to stammer again.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very regretful, really regretful.</p><p>He wanted to know when Your Highness saw the main character receiving a punishment.</p><p>He really wanted to know.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Juan lowered his head in frustration, beginning to reflect on himself.</p><p>This shouldn't be happening.</p><p>He was a mature salted fish; how could he be so childish and petty.</p><p>Be more magnanimous.</p><p>Your Highness seeing the main character receive a punishment behind his back wasn't that big of a deal.</p><p>Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan close, inhaling the scent of the youth. Despite being aware of Jiang Juan's unusual behavior, Xue Fangli still said languidly, "Could it be you're still wondering when this king saw the second son?"</p><p>"Aren't you not supposed to know?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn it, I'm blocked again.</p><p>Jiang Juan was desperate to know but he also cared about his dignity, so he could only say gloomily, "It's... not."</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly, "If not, then just sleep."</p><p>How could he possibly fall asleep? Jiang Juan buried his head in Xue Fangli's embrace, only to lift it after a moment and ask slowly, "Your Excellency, are you asleep?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond but reached out gently to pinch Jiang Juan's face, "What do you really want to say?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>In the darkness, Xue Fangli lowered his eyes at him for a moment, lips curling into an evil smile. However, his tone remained indifferent.</p><p>"You only ate some crab meat at the banquet, yet you're hungry again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't actually hungry, but what could he do? He nodded slightly and admitted hopelessly, "Yes, I'm hungry."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and released Jiang Juan from his embrace, lighting the candle.</p><p>As soon as Liangfeng Manor was lit up, the maid waiting outside knocked on the door. Xue Fangli ordered, "Prepare the meal."</p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p>It was so late; Jiang Juan had no appetite, and even if they brought the food, he wouldn't eat it. Reluctantly, Jiang Juan changed his mind and said, "Your Excellency, I'm not hungry anymore."</p><p>Xue Fangli turned to look at him, eyelids slightly lowered, showing no displeasure on his face. His tone seemed confused as he asked, "What's wrong with you tonight?"</p><p>"I've been unhappy since the banquet started."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn it, I'm blocked again.</p><p>Jiang Juan was desperate to know but also cared about his dignity, so he could only say gloomily, "It’s... not."</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly, "If not, then just sleep."</p><p>How could he possibly fall asleep? Jiang Juan buried his head in Xue Fangli's embrace, only to lift it after a moment and ask slowly, "Your Excellency, are you asleep?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond but reached out gently to pinch Jiang Juan's face, "What do you really want to say?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>In the darkness, Xue Fangli lowered his eyes at him for a moment, lips curling into an evil smile.

His tone seemed confused as he asked, "What’s wrong with you tonight?"</p><p>"I’ve been unhappy since the banquet started."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn it, I’m blocked again.</p><p>Desperate to know but also clinging to his dignity, Jiang Juan could only say gloomily, "It's... not."</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly, "If not, then just sleep."</p><p>How could he possibly fall asleep? Jiang Juan buried his head in Xue Fangli's embrace, only to lift it after a moment and ask slowly, "Your Excellency, are you asleep?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond but reached out gently to pinch Jiang Juan’s cheek, "What do you really want to say?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>In the darkness, Xue Fangli lowered his eyes at him for a moment, lips curling into an evil smile. However, his tone remained indifferent.</p><p>"You only ate some crab meat at the banquet, yet you're hungry again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't actually hungry, but what could he do?

His tone seemed confused as he asked, "What’s wrong with you tonight?"</p><p>"I’ve been unhappy since the banquet started."</p><p>Jiang Juan recalled for a moment, "You weren't too unhappy about it, were you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him instead, "Why aren't you unhappy?"</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli said thoughtfully, "If this had not happened at Princess Chang's residence and you had merely mentioned it casually, I might have misunderstood that you were upset about this meeting with the Second Prince."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>There he went shutting him up again.</p><p>Jiang Juan lay back on the bed calmly, reaching out to pull the beadstring.</p><p>The curtains swayed, producing a clear sound. Jiang Juan sighed and turned his head, lightly bumping into the armrest.</p><p>He did have pride after all.</p><p>But he was sleepless.</p><p>Jiang Juan thought hard, but he didn't control his strength well, banging his head rather forcefully. He cried out in pain and held his forehead as he sat up. Jiang Juan frowned and said, "Ouch, that hurts."</p><p>In the next moment, the hand covering Jiang Juan's forehead was removed, and someone lifted his face. Xue Fangli lowered his head to examine him for a while. His forehead wasn't injured, but it had turned red.</p><p>Xue Fangli gently touched Jiang Juan's forehead and finally gave up teasing him, sighing nearly aloud, "Why do you keep lying?"</p><p>"Little liar."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke slowly, "Didn't you want to know when I met the Second Prince?"</p><p>"How many times did you lie this evening?"</p><p>After a brief pause, Jiang Juan reacted to something incredulously and asked him, "Your Highness, you know, right?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Yes, this Lord knows."</p><p>"This Lord wants to know, just how stubborn your mouth is."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He had agonized for so long.</p><p>Was the King laughing at his joke from start to finish?</p><p>"Why are you like this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was starting to feel embarrassed and angry, "What about me lying to you? You've been deliberately asking questions despite knowing everything."</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled softly but did not respond. He only asked him again, "This Lord will ask you once more: Do you want to know?"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him; a hint of dignity compelled him to respond vaguely, "What do you say?"</p><p>"Should this Lord say it?" Xue Fangli said slowly, "This Lord thinks you don't want to know."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>"I want to know what you want to know," Jiang Juan stopped pretending and laid his cards on the table, "When did you secretly meet my brother?"</p><p>He emphasized, "I don't mind; I'm just curious."</p><p>Still trying to defend himself.</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly, still not answering immediately. He asked Jiang Juan, "Do you still remember what this king said to you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said with interest, "Call me husband."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and replied firmly, "... You say it first. I'll do some mental preparation."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Huh? Really?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes, really, more genuine than pearls. Hurry up and say it."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, looking at him with a smile that was almost not a smile. Jiang Juan could no longer bear it and pretended to shake him, "Hurry up and admit the truth. If you don't, I'll treat you as if you're guilty and won't be friends with you anymore."</p><p>Not wanting to have nothing to do with each other, Xue Fangli couldn't continue teasing Jiang Juan. He said lightly, "I took you to the Hundred Flowers Garden for a day. You were sleeping, and he accidentally entered the Plum Blossom Courtyard. This king said a few words."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Just that???"</p><p>"Not yet?" Xue Fangli looked at him and smiled, saying, "Since my wife is so strict, how dare this king go out to flirt? Moreover—"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??:"</p><p>Thank goodness, thank goodness.</p><p>Jiang Juan lost her dreams again and slowly laid down flat.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "Didn't you say husband?"</p><p>Jiang Juan acted petulantly, saying, "I said I would call you, but I didn't say it would be today. Let's talk about this tomorrow."</p><p>Xue Fangli had anticipated his petulance and was not surprised, only snorting in response.</p><p>He merely called him 'husband' today, but would refuse to do so tomorrow.</p><p>After lying down for a short while, Jiang Juan sat up again, speaking slowly to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, is it my turn to settle accounts with you now?"</p><p>"You stole an evening of laughter from me."</p><p>The lanterns in the Liangfeng Courtyard had been lit for too long. Gao Guanshi suspected that something might be wrong and hurriedly dressed, rushing over. Just as he raised his hand to knock on the door, he saw their Wangfei open it unhappily.</p><p>"Get out of here. You're not allowed to sleep here tonight."</p><p>Gao Guanshi: "?"</p><p>He was taken aback, momentarily stunned.</p><p>In the next second, the door was pushed open, and a man with a sinister expression walked out. He glanced at Gao Guanshi and asked coldly, "Anything?"</p><p>Gao Guanshi: "... N-nothing."</p><p>Oh heavens.</p><p>It seemed he had run into their Wangfei chasing their Wangye out of the room.</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>Wasn't this the Liangfeng Courtyard belonging to Wangye?</p><p>Their Wangfei chased their Wangye out of his own Liangfeng Courtyard.</p><p>The senior executive fell into silence.</p><p>Have they officially changed the name from Li Wangfu to Li Wangfeifu now?</p>
