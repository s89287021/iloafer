						<p>Jiang Juan frowned, asking very seriously.</p><p>He said on his lips, "Can you carry me?" "Can you hold up?" "Are you capable?", but in fact, Jiang Juan really felt that Sch Fanli could not answer any of the above questions.</p><p>Sch Fanli: "..."</p><p>His eyelids lifted; he was too lazy to talk and only stretched out his hand to pinch the young man's face, preventing him from speaking further.</p><p>"You always used sweet words before," said Sch Fanli, "but now you say whatever angers me."</p><p>"You are so annoying."</p><p>Jiang Juan could not speak clearly due to being pinched, so he reached out to pinch his hand instead. "I am concerned about your health. Whatever angers you, I am clearly doing this out of concern that you will get tired later."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Sch Fanli laughed bitterly in anger. His red lips curled up, and his expression was especially dangerous. "If I were really so useless, what should be done?"</p><p>"What else can be done," Jiang Juan said, "Even if you are not capable, we still have to make do somehow."</p><p>Not catching the sarcasm in Sch Fanli's words, Jiang Juan paused for a moment before comforting him again: "It's fine. You just have a weak body recently."</p><p>Waiting for his grandfather's friend - that renowned physician - to come and examine him, he might be able to recover.</p><p>However, these thoughts were not expressed by Jiang Juan because he was afraid the physician would also be unable to help, so he did not plan on telling Sch Fanli about this physician or his plans. Otherwise, if his emotions fluctuated too much, the condition could worsen.</p><p>Sch Fanli glanced at Jiang Juan with a half-smile and said, "One day you will know whether I am capable."</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed, still feeling that Sch Fanli was being stubborn. He nodded slightly, giving Sch Fanli some face reluctantly and said insincerely, "Yes, yes, what you say is right. You are capable, you really are capable."</p><p>"Would you like to eat ice cream?"</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his hand and brought the ice cream to his lips, harshly changing the subject. "Try a bite, it's delicious."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at the youth a few times, only feeling that he was reckless with his life. But ultimately, it was not him who had spoiled the person into this state.</p><p>No matter how annoying he might be, there was nothing much he could do about it.</p><p>Now all he could do was record everything in detail and wait for the youth to recover his health before slowly teaching him a lesson, making him understand just how vengeful he could be.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head and absentmindedly ate the ice cream Jiang Juan had brought to him.</p><p>Tasty?</p><p>The taste of the youth should be sweeter and softer than this ice cream.</p><p>He was the one who tasted good.</p><p>When they returned to the palace, the carriage stopped in front of Lingguang Pavilion. Before Jiang Juan could step out, she heard a burst of crying and pleading.</p><p>"Empress, Your Excellency is magnanimous, please forgive me."</p><p>"Empress, Empress—!"</p><p>The woman's voice was sharp and tinged with tears. Jiang Juan was stunned and hurriedly lifted the curtain, only to see Gangaoguan drenched in sweat as he pulled up Meifei, repeatedly bowing and smiling apologetically: "Madame Meifei, please do not kneel here. Later, your servant will report to the Empress. Please do not act like this."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked bewildered, unsure what she was begging her for forgiveness for, and turned to look at Xue Fangli, "What happened?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled faintly, "Nothing much really."</p><p>On the day of his coronation ceremony, because Jiang Juan had fainted, the ceremony was forced to be suspended. However, many things were prepared in advance, such as the edicts for bestowing titles on princes and how to settle the consorts.</p><p>Meifei's visit this time was simply due to Xue Fangli sending her to Chang'an Temple to accompany Empress Dowager by the side of the ancient lamps and Buddha statues. However, she did not want to leave the palace.</p><p>As for the Crown Prince Xue Chaohua, Xue Fangli had given him his title as usual but exiled him far away, only allowing him to return to the capital upon summons.</p><p>Mei Fei was well aware that her father had already been dealt with; it would inevitably be her and Xue Chaohua's turn—back when the prince was being enfeoffed, it was they who had instructed Li Shilang to speak ill of Jiang Juan.</p><p>But Mei Fei was unwilling to accept this fate.</p><p>They were both concubines, so why could Ning Fei enjoy a peaceful life as a Grand Consort and bask in luxury in the palace, with her status rising dramatically, while she was forced to eat vegetarian food and recite scriptures in a temple?</p><p>And there was that sixth prince. Although they shared the same title, not only was Xue Chaohua's fiefdom far away, it was also very poor; whereas Xue Congjun had been granted an extremely prosperous region without having to leave immediately.</p><p>It truly was comparison that made one bitter.</p><p>Mei Fei tossed and turned for several nights over this, regretting her actions deeply, and could only watch helplessly as Ning Fei and Xue Congjun took advantage of Jiang Juan's influence.</p><p>The next day, Xue Chaohua was to depart for his fiefdom, and Mei Fei had to leave the palace to go to Zhao'an Temple.</p><p>Mei Fei was extremely reluctant, so when she heard that Jiang Juan had regained consciousness, she gritted her teeth and came to visit him.</p><p>In the end, it was she who had offended Jiang Juan, becoming a thorn in the new emperor's side. Mei Fei could only come to apologize to Jiang Juan; if he softened his heart, perhaps the new emperor would reconsider his decision.</p><p>"Why is she crying like this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't stupid, and since he now knew Xue Fangli's true nature, it was clear that she had cried like this because of something he had done behind her back.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "I just sent her to Zhao'an Temple to accompany Empress Dowager."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't have a good relationship with the empress dowager; there was no way he would be so kind as to send someone specifically to accompany her. Jiang Juan said unhappily, "If you lie again today, you'll sleep somewhere else."</p><p>Seeing that he was about to get angry, Xue Fangli sighed lightly and spoke again, "When the prince was being enfeoffed, she, my brother, and Li Xiang didn't dare say anything bad about me; instead, they sent people to speak ill of you. Of course, I had to settle accounts with them."</p><p>"Taking her life would definitely not be something you'd agree to. Since she gets along well with the empress dowager, she should go to Zhao'an Temple to serve her."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes, "Ah, so that's how it is."</p><p>Mei Fei was acutely aware that her father had already been dealt with; it was now her and Xue Chaohua's turn—back when the prince was being enfeoffed, they had manipulated Li Shilang to speak ill of Jiang Juan.</p><p>But Mei Fei was far from resigned.</p><p>Both were concubines, yet why could Ning Fei live a peaceful life as Grand Consort, enjoying opulence and high status in the palace, while Mei Fei was destined for vegetarian meals and monastic chanting?</p><p>And there was the sixth prince. Despite sharing the same title, Xue Chaohua's fiefdom was both distant and impoverished; Xue Congjun, on the other hand, had been granted a prosperous region without having to leave immediately.</p><p>It truly was a bitter reminder of how comparisons could sting.</p><p>Mei Fei lay awake for several nights, filled with regret over her actions, and could only watch helplessly as Ning Fei and Xue Congjun benefited from Jiang Juan's influence.</p><p>The next day, Xue Chaohua was to depart for his fiefdom, and Mei Fei had to leave the palace to take up residence at Zhao'an Temple.</p><p>Reluctant though she was, Mei Fei visited Jiang Juan after hearing that he had regained consciousness, determined to apologize despite her reluctance. Having offended Jiang Juan and become a thorn in the new emperor's side, Mei Fei could only hope that his softened heart might prompt the new emperor to reconsider his decision.</p><p>"Why is she crying like this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't stupid; knowing Xue Fangli's true nature, he understood that her tears were the result of something he had done behind her back.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "I simply sent her to Zhao'an Temple to accompany Empress Dowager."</p><p>Given his strained relationship with the empress dowager, it was unlikely that Xue Fangli would be so kind as to send someone specifically to accompany her. Jiang Juan said unhappily, "If you lie again today, you'll sleep somewhere else."</p><p>Seeing that he was about to get angry, Xue Fangli sighed lightly and continued, "When the prince was being enfeoffed, she, my brother, and Li Xiang dared not speak ill of me but instead sent people to defame you. Naturally, I had to settle accounts with them."</p><p>"Taking her life would never be something you'd agree to. Since she has a good relationship with the empress dowager, she should go to Zhao'an Temple to serve her."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes in surprise, "Ah, so that's how it is."</p><p>Mei Fei was acutely aware that her father had already been punished; it would now be her and Xue Chaohua's turn. When the prince was being enfeoffed, she had manipulated Li Shilang to speak ill of Jiang Juan.</p><p>Yet Mei Fei could not accept her fate without regret.</p><p>Both were concubines, yet why could Ning Fei lead a life of peace as Grand Consort, enjoying opulence and high status in the palace, while Mei Fei was destined for a life of vegetarian meals and monastic chanting?</p><p>And there was the sixth prince. Despite sharing the same title, Xue Chaohua's fiefdom was both distant and impoverished; Xue Congjun, on the other hand, had been granted a prosperous region without having to leave immediately.</p><p>It truly was a bitter reminder of how comparisons could sting.</p><p>Mei Fei lay awake for several nights, filled with remorse over her actions, and could only watch helplessly as Ning Fei and Xue Congjun benefited from Jiang Juan's influence.</p><p>The next day, Xue Chaohua was to depart for his fiefdom, and Mei Fei had to leave the palace to take up residence at Zhao'an Temple.</p><p>Reluctant though she was, Mei Fei visited Jiang Juan after hearing that he had regained consciousness, determined to apologize despite her reluctance. Having offended Jiang Juan and become a thorn in the new emperor's side, Mei Fei could only hope that his softened heart might prompt the new emperor to reconsider his decision.</p><p>"Why is she crying like this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was no fool; knowing Xue Fangli's true nature, he understood that her tears were the result of something he had done behind her back.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "I simply sent her to Zhao'an Temple to accompany Empress Dowager."</p><p>Given his strained relationship with the empress dowager, it was unlikely that Xue Fangli would be so kind as to send someone specifically to accompany her. Jiang Juan said unhappily, "If you lie again today, you'll sleep somewhere else."</p><p>Seeing that he was about to get angry, Xue Fangli sighed lightly and continued, "When the prince was being enfeoffed, she, my brother, and Li Xiang dared not speak ill of me but instead sent people to defame you. Naturally, I had to settle accounts with them."</p><p>"Taking her life would never be something you'd agree to. Since she has a good relationship with the empress dowager, she should go to Zhao'an Temple to serve her."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes in surprise, "Ah, so that's how it is."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, "You heartless little one."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained, "Why am I the heartless one?"</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly, "You want me to take care of the people who bullied you, yet you ask me to leave and sleep elsewhere."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt guilty and said, "But how was I supposed to know that it was for you?"</p><p>No matter what he said, Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and leisurely replied, "I troubled her so much, yet I did not take her life and even allowed her to leave the palace safely. Don't you have anything to say to me about this?"</p><p>These words sounded reasonable at first, even making Mei Fei feel grateful towards Xue Fangli.</p><p>In reality, however, not taking her life was a mere formality. Mei Fei's indulgent lifestyle and sending her to a temple almost cost her half of her life. After all, life in the temple was hard, and they did not support idlers. If Mei Fei wanted food, she had to work.</p><p>Furthermore, when Xue Chaohua went to his fiefdom, mother and son were separated. In the future, their meetings would be rare, and Mei Fei could only think of her son every day.</p><p>But Jiang Juan was unaware of these circumstances; he was truly deceived and sincerely apologized with guilt, "…I'm sorry."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, "Is that all you have to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>He felt guilty. Jiang Juan sighed and resignedly straddled Xue Fangli's lap before naively kissing him.</p><p>But Xue Fangli turned his head away, not allowing Jiang Juan to kiss him, merely saying casually, "Just a kiss to dismiss me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan innocently asked, "…Is that not allowed?"</p><p>"Not enough."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only ask, "Then what do you want from me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli stretched out his hand, gripping Jiang Juan's waist. His gaze was dark, with desire stirring within it. Xue Fangli leaned close to Jiang Juan's ear, his voice sultry.</p><p>"The next time, let me kiss you."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes flickered, and her fingertips began to turn red.</p><p>When Xue Fangli said he wanted to kiss, it naturally meant more than just a simple kiss. Before Jiang Juan was about to cry due to his actions, Xue Fangli's kisses had already shown a downward trend, but Jiang Juan was simply too shy to allow him to kiss her recklessly.</p><p>If he wants me to kiss him, I'll kiss him all over.</p><p>"But..."</p><p>"I intended to spare her life with kindness, yet you nearly chased me out."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What else could he do? He had no choice but to glance elsewhere, saying in a wet-eyed voice, "Alright then."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled nonchalantly. While he did gain a significant advantage, he was still greedy enough not to let go of even one of Jiang Juan's kisses.</p><p>The boy had already sat into his arms and offered him a kiss proactively. There was no reason for him not to accept it.</p><p>Xue Fangli pressed Jiang Juan's nape and leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>Outside the carriage, Mei Fei was still wailing.</p><p>"Empress, I made mistakes in the past. As you are kind-hearted, please forgive me."</p><p>"Empress, these few days, while you were unconscious, I have been praying for your recovery. I realize my mistake now; truly, I do."</p><p>Mei Fei's words were sincere, almost genuinely heartfelt, yet her strategy to save her country through manipulation was bound to fail.</p><p>The two nobles inside the carriage remained silent throughout. Director Wang's face turned ashen, assuming they were too annoyed to alight from the vehicle, he hastily gave a signal with his eyes.</p><p>Unable to persuade them, he had no choice but to call on the guards.</p><p>The guards approached and said, "Excuse us," before hoisting Mei Fei like a sack of hemp, and then marched out in large strides.</p><p>"Let me go! Let me go!"</p><p>Receiving no response, Mei Fei refused to move and began to fiercely pound the guards. Whether it was due to her intense struggle or because she hit a sensitive spot, the guards' grip slipped, resulting in a "thud" as Mei Fei fell to the ground solidly.</p><p>The impact caused her face to contort with pain.</p><p>Since they had already thrown her outside, the guards did not bother with her further and turned back, walking away into the palace hall. The palace gates slowly began to close.</p><p>Mei Fei stared blankly for a while, intending to stand up but unable to do so due to the severity of the fall. She could only crawl along the ground.</p><p>"Empress! Empress——!"</p><p>"Bang——!"</p><p>The palace gate finally closed completely.</p><p>Mei Fei's carefully laid plans had utterly fallen through.</p><p>Staring blankly at the door, her strength drained away entirely. She nearly collapsed on the spot, filled with regret.</p><p>Why didn't she leave a way out initially?</p><p>Even if she regretted it now, there was no use.</p><p>From this day forth, she would have to remain in Zhaoguan Temple, constantly by the light of lanterns, observing her vegetarian vows and chanting sutras.</p><p>Jiang JianSu woke up, everything should get back on track.</p><p>After letting Jiang Jian rest for a few days, this day, Xue FangLi went to handle the official matters again and didn't intend to let Jiang Jian off; he also wanted him to go with.</p><p>Jiang Jian was very reluctant, "But I want to sleep."</p><p>As it turned out, Jiang Jian sleeping a lot might have something to do with his unstable spirit, but not that much, because now his spirit was very stable, yet Jiang Jian still slept a lot.</p><p>"It won't take long."</p><p>Jiang Jian sat on the bed shaking his head, his eyebrows furrowed tightly, he really didn't want to go.</p><p>"I'll read the memorial, I have nothing else to do, it's better to sleep."</p><p>Xue FangLi said in a calm tone, "Sleeping in my arms is the same."</p><p>Jiang Jian said, "But why would I choose not to sleep on a good bed and instead sleep in your arms?"</p><p>"You need to accompany me."</p><p>"I don't want to."</p><p>Jiang Jian shook his head repeatedly, still refusing. Seeing this, Xue FangLi glanced at him thoughtfully and stood up.</p><p>"Then forget it."</p><p>So easy?</p><p>Jiang Jian sneaked a look at him, feeling relieved inside. He was just about to lie back down when he hadn't even touched the pillow when he heard several light coughs.</p><p>"Cough, cough."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, covered his mouth with his hand, and couldn't stop coughing.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up in surprise and almost jumped off the bed. He ran over while still wearing his slippers, "Are you okay? Did you cough up blood?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and said calmly, "I'm fine."</p><p>Hearing Xue Fangli cough, Jiang Juan's heart tightened. Although he said he was fine, Jiang Juan still grabbed Xue Fangli's hand to check; fortunately, there was no blood, a stroke of luck.</p><p>"Thank goodness."</p><p>Even though he said that, Jiang Juan couldn't let it go. He didn't want to accompany Xue Fangli in reading the imperial edicts anymore but reluctantly said, "Forget it, I'll come with you anyway so at least I can see you."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "There's no need. You didn't cough up blood, and eunuch Wang is here. If anything happens, he will summon a physician."</p><p>Jiang Juan insisted, "Eunuch Wang is just an eunuch. Anyway, you said it won't take long, so I'll stay with you for a while."</p><p>"Anyway, now... I can't sleep either."</p><p>Xue Fangli said gently, "If you don't want to go, you don't have to."</p><p>Jiang Juan found him nagging and said, "I want to go. Wait a moment, I'll ask someone to boil—"</p><p>Before he could finish saying "boil medicine," Jiang Juan was picked up by Xue Fangli. Xue Fangli smiled and said happily, "You can drink it later."</p><p>Thinking that he had said it wouldn't take long, Jiang Juan gave up, "Okay."</p><p>"Don't carry me."</p><p>Xue Fangli had just finished coughing, and although there was no blood, Jiang Juan still worried about exhausting him too much, so he said, "Put me down."</p><p>Jiang Juan's thoughts were clear to Xue Fangli, "I can carry you."</p><p>Jiang Juan comforted him, "Mm, I of course know that you can hold me. You put me down first, and after we get there, when you sit down, I will carry you again, okay? That way, I won't press on you."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>He slowly lowered his head and looked into Jiang Juan's eyes. Jiang Juan said sincerely, "Don't be too hard on yourself."</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Xue Fangli did not let go. He held Jiang Juan expressionlessly and walked away in big strides.</p><p>But to Jiang Juan, this only proved one thing.</p><p>——Your Highness, ah no, the Emperor's sense of self-respect is really strong.</p><p>Why does he love showing off so much?</p>
