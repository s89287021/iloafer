						<p>Jiang Juan let go of his hand, and the curtains followed suit, falling down. The beads clinked as he idly played with the crystal beads.</p><p>Xue Fangli thought he would ask for something, but Jiang Juan did not; in fact, he was unusually quiet. Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan without any expression on his face.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked over, sensing something, and asked doubtfully, "Prince Wang, what's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli continued to stare at him without saying a word, only lowering his eyelids.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli finally spoke, but he did not address Jiang Juan directly.</p><p>"Go to the other estate."</p><p>At this, Jiang Juan inadvertently tugged on the beads, causing them to clink loudly.</p><p>Ah, the other estate.</p><p>The plot seemed about to unfold.</p><p>The coachman heard and began to turn around. The narrow street was almost fully occupied, and passersby quickly moved out of the way. Everyone knew that it was a carriage from Li Manor—gilded and adorned with jade, decorated with crystal, extravagantly luxurious.</p><p>"Whoa!" </p><p>At the same time, another carriage came racing towards them. Its coachman tightened the reins in time to avoid a collision. The young man inside asked softly, "Why did we stop?"</p><p>"In reply, my lord, there is a carriage from Li Manor ahead."</p><p>"Li Manor…"</p><p>The youth's face turned pale, as if recalling something terribly horrifying. His fingers trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>The maid Dian Cui noticed his unusual behavior and asked him with concern, "Second Young Master, are you alright? Could it be that you haven't fully recovered from falling into the water recently...?"</p><p>Second Young Master.</p><p>Yes, he was still the Second Young Master of the Shangshu Mansion, not Lady Li's ex-husband.</p><p>The young man, Jiang Nian, slowly breathed out and finally calmed down. He shook his head and forced a smile, "I'm fine."</p><p>Dian Cui was still somewhat uneasy and kept staring at him, but she soon got distracted.</p><p>Before entering the mansion, Dian Cui had heard that Second Young Master was the most beautiful man in the capital. However, upon meeting him for the first time, she didn't find him particularly handsome. Later, after secretly asking a few of her sisters, she realized it was her own lack of sophistication.</p><p>—Beauty lies in one's essence rather than appearance. Our young master may not be breathtakingly handsome, but he is captivating and has excellent demeanor; Little Immortal Xue is no joke.</p><p>Dian Cui couldn't read a single character and hadn't yet grasped Second Young Master's beauty, but the entire capital praised him for his good looks, so she believed he was beautiful, attributing it to her ignorance.</p><p>Noticing her gaze, Jiang Nian asked with amusement, "Why are you looking at me like that again?"</p><p>Dian Cui replied, "Young Master is handsome; after all, he's the most beautiful man in the capital."</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled and gently stopped her, "Don't say such things; people would laugh if they heard."</p><p>Dian Cui stuck out her tongue, "Everyone says so."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Nian felt helpless but was in a good mood.</p><p>Yes, in his previous life.</p><p>Heaven have mercy, after Jiang Nian died of depression, he had been given a second chance to live again.</p><p>This time, he relied on his memories from his previous life and would never leave any regrets for himself.</p><p>For example, befriending his classmates and several princes.</p><p>For example, accepting the love of Duke Pingan.</p><p>In his previous life, contrary to everyone's expectations, the throne ultimately fell to Duke Pingan. He would become the most revered person in the world.</p><p>As long as the Emperor approves, it is just a matter of waiting for the palace to grant the marriage.</p><p>He would also become an incomparably noble person.</p><p>The villa was located on the outskirts of the capital.</p><p>Below, it was already late spring with flowers wilting, but up on the mountain, there was still a sea of wisteria blossoms.</p><p>Upon arrival, Jiang Juan was isolated in a separate courtyard. Once everything was prepared, the Chief Steward also came to visit.</p><p>Learning that the Prince was staying at the villa, he hurriedly brought a box of spices uphill, of course, the Chief Steward conveniently carried the wolf pup that Jiang Juan had saved.</p><p>"The doctor examined it and said there's nothing serious; it just needs some time to recover," the Chief Steward said.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and squatted in front of the cage. The young wolf seemed to recognize him, pressing its head against the cage and quietly shedding tears.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed, "So pitiful."</p><p>He asked Lanting for a handkerchief and carefully wiped the tears from the young wolf's eyes. Lanting found it inappropriate and whispered, "Young Master, let me do it."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, "No need."</p><p>The wolf pup might have been in severe pain, its tears flowing so heavily that they could not be wiped away completely. Jiang Juan patted its head, which the Chief Steward watched with much confusion.</p><p>It was just a beast, after all. Why should he bother handling it himself?</p><p>Third Young Master was truly an extraordinary person.</p><p>Although he thought about it, High Executive Minister did not reveal anything on the surface. He smiled and said, "Lady Wang, if there are no other instructions, this servant will take my leave."</p><p>"Alright," Jiang Juan responded, suddenly remembering something and calling him back, "Wait a moment."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Is Young Master well?"</p><p>High Executive Minister was taken aback and tried to evade the question, saying, "… He's fine."</p><p>In reality, he was not doing well.</p><p>High Executive Minister had been staying in the mansion for several years and knew that Young Master would rarely visit this villa unless his condition was at its worst.</p><p>— Continuous aching pain, excruciating pain during episodes, and an inability to rest for long periods; even a Great Golden Immortal could not withstand it.</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh," then proceeded to wipe the tears from the young wolf's eyes. High Executive Minister then left.</p><p>Lan Ting watched quietly and whispered, "Actually, this little wolf pup isn't that pitiful either. At least, it met Young Master."</p><p>Just as she finished speaking, Lan Ting suddenly remembered something and exclaimed, "Ah!" She said in frustration, "Young Master, you should take a medicinal bath tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback: "Medicinal bath?"</p><p>Before crossing over to this world, he had regularly stayed in the hospital and used medicinal baths to nourish his body.</p><p>However, after recalling the settings, Jiang Juan understood.</p><p>In this role, his heart disease was feigned, but his congenital insufficiency was real. It made sense that he would use medicinal baths.</p><p>But now we are on the mountain, where would there be any medicinal herbs? Jiang Juan said uncertainly, "Why not another day?"</p><p>"That's not possible," Lan Ting shook her head, not daring to joke about it. She thought for a moment and said, "I will ask Manager Gao."</p><p>After saying that, Lan Ting hurriedly got up and went to catch up with Manager Gao.</p><p>Manager Gao was quite quick-footed. In just a short while, he had disappeared from sight. Lan Ting could only continue forward. She ran at a steady pace but did not get far when someone turned onto the stone bridge beside her, causing them to collide.</p><p>"Ouch—!"</p><p>The person stumbled and dropped the wooden box they were holding. Lan Ting was about to apologize when she looked up and saw it was Manager Gao.</p><p>"Manager, our master needs regular medicinal baths. Is there any... "</p><p>"Do you know what you've done?"</p><p>Manager Gao interrupted her with a pale face.</p><p>Lan Ting was frightened by his reaction. "I... I..."</p><p>Manager Gao's lips moved but fear prevented him from uttering a word. After a long while, he stammered, "These are the spices His Highness needs! You're going to kill all of us!"</p><p>"I didn't mean to..." Lan Ting said anxiously, "It wasn't intentional. I didn't know."</p><p>Manager Gao's face was grim. "His Highness doesn't care about these things; he only wants the spices."</p><p>Unfortunately, the spices had been soaked and were now unusable.</p><p>And right now was when His Highness' condition was at its worst. Without the soothing effect of the spices, he would only become more violent and deranged!</p><p>When he thought of this, the high official's hair stood on end; he had no idea what to do. In the midst of the standoff, a voice rang out. "What is it?" It was Jiang Juan who had arrived. After waiting for quite some time and still not seeing Lanting return, Jiang Juan came looking for her only to find the high official looking dejected and tears in Lanting's eyes. Jiang Juan asked her, "Why are you crying?" "The Prince's spices..." Lanting lowered her head in self-reproach, explaining everything that had happened. The high official added, "The Prince has a discerning palate; he is accustomed to the scent of this spice. Now—" "Ah!" The high official sighed heavily. Upon hearing this, Lanting knew she was in deep trouble and lowered her head with tears welling up in her eyes. Jiang Juan, who hated seeing girls cry, quickly comforted her, "Don't cry, let's think of a solution together." The high official: "...". What other solutions were there? The high official was at his wits' end. Meanwhile, after soothing Lanting, Jiang Juan suddenly remembered something and hurriedly asked, "Lanting, is the sachet you gave me this morning still around?" "It is," although Lanting was confused, she took out a sachet from her pocket, "Here." Relieved, Jiang Juan said to the high official, "Perhaps we should take the sachet to the Prince first?" The high official seemed hesitant. It wasn't that any scent would do; the Prince only wanted this particular spice and was accustomed to its fragrance. Furthermore, its calming effect was such that a bit more could even put the Prince to sleep, although the side effects were significant.</p><p>He slept, thus becoming completely unaware of his surroundings. The next day, he would feel drowsy and disoriented.</p><p>Of course, the high official would not mention these effects to Jiang Juan.</p><p>The high official said with great difficulty, "It might not work."</p><p>Jiang Juan insisted, "Let's try it anyway."</p><p>In the morning when entering the palace, Xue Fangli had asked him about the smell on his body and had said it was acceptable. That meant he should not dislike the scent of the sachet.</p><p>The high official was quite hesitant; having already committed a major mistake, taking that damn sachet would be too much for him to handle.</p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Juan simply said, "I'll go ask the Prince myself."</p><p>The high official looked at him in surprise and thought it might be better if someone else took responsibility. He quickly said, "Please trouble Your Highness—this way, please."</p><p>The high official led the way; before long, they arrived at a pavilion.</p><p>"Prince…"</p><p>"The perfume."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the high official stammered for a long time without forming a complete sentence. Jiang Juan, unable to bear it, answered for him, "Prince, your perfumes are no longer usable."</p><p>"They all fell into the lake…"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered this and quickly added, "But regarding the sachet you asked me about in the morning, I managed to get one. Would you like to use it temporarily?"</p><p>The high official: "……"</p><p>He was filled with regret. To be honest, the Prince might have spared him a full body, but now he probably wouldn’t even have his ashes left.</p><p>The Executive Affairs Secretary almost laughed out loud.</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent.</p><p>Silence, complete silence.</p><p>No one knew how long it had been when two maids standing on the side moved the screen. A man got up from the bed, his long hair blending with the intricate black and golden robe.</p><p>"Perfume pouch?"</p><p>He spoke slowly, his voice soft and languid.</p><p>Jiang Juan took a few steps forward and extended her hand, on which was a perfume pouch. "This one, you said the smell was acceptable this morning."</p><p>Xue Fangli took it with weary expression. In the dim light, his pale and slender fingers threaded through the fine red string, then lifted it to sniff lightly.</p><p>It smelled of white peonies, autumn orchids, and senna seeds.</p><p>Apart from that, there was a faint trace of another scent.</p><p>Very subtle, yet unbearably sweet.</p><p>"It’s not its smell."</p><p>He pinched the pouch with his fingers and let go. The perfume pouch fell to the ground as he raised his eyelid to stare at Jiang Juan, his bloodshot eyes full of emotion.</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled nonchalantly, "It probably won’t do."</p><p>—Li Wang did not get into any trouble.</p><p>High Official Shi saw Jiang Nian looking at him and asked with a smile, "Second Young Master, do you have any instructions?"</p><p>Jiang Nian first shook his head, then thought for a moment before asking High Official Shi, "Esteemed Sir, how did the Princess Consort get injured?"</p><p>Jiang Nian was clearly worried, and his expression did not seem fake. Seeing this, High Official Shi only smiled and vaguely replied, "Some unexpected incidents occurred."</p><p>Having served Prince Wang for so many years, he had developed a keen sense of reading people's expressions. This Second Young Master seemed genuinely concerned on the surface, but there was not an ounce of genuine worry.</p><p>However...</p><p>Wasn't this Second Young Master of the Ministry of Personnel considered the first beauty in the capital?</p><p>High Official Shi silently observed him for a moment again. The young man had indeed handsome features, but compared to their Princess Consort, he seemed like a bully.</p><p>Didn't celestial beings and beauties bully "people"?</p><p>High Official Shi was morally corrupt, yet his expression did not change. Hearing what he said, Jiang Nian hesitated for a while before asking, "... Could it be because my younger brother is inexperienced and offended Prince Wang?"</p><p>What kind of temper Li Wang had, how could Jiang Nian not know? The moment Secretary Jiang mentioned that Jiang Juan was injured, his first reaction was that Li Wang was the one who acted. Furthermore, High Official Shi avoided mentioning this matter directly.</p><p>In a previous life, Li Wang had treated him in the same way; he nearly got killed by this man.</p><p>Jiang Nian paused and said with guilt, "My younger brother has been sick in the countryside since childhood and was only recently brought back to the capital. He is inexperienced with many things and did not offend Prince Wang intentionally."</p><p>High Official Shi: "?"</p><p>What does this have to do with their Prince Wang?</p><p>The Princess Consort's injury had nothing to do with Prince Wang.</p><p>Not to mention how the Prince often indulged his Consort, this time the Consort had saved his life. No matter how tyrannical the Prince was, he would not repay a favor with enmity.</p><p>Jiang Nian just smiled, still convinced that Jiang Juan had been injured by King Li.</p><p>Perhaps the outcome of King Li had changed, but a person's temperament could not be altered. King Li was simply such a person—tyrannical, cruel, and unpredictable in his moods.</p><p>In his previous life, Jiang Nian suffered day and night, living in constant fear.</p><p>In this life, Jiang Juan suffered day and night, living in constant fear.</p><p>Jiang Nian lifted the tea cup to her lips and took a sip of tea.</p><p>How pitiful.</p><p>Secretary Jiang had matters to attend to later and urged him, "Hurry up."</p>
