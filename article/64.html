						<p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, barely swiping away Jiang Juan's hand, and paused.</p><p>This term of address was too awkward to say, so Jiang Juan stretched out the sound of 'ben' very long, with unclear enunciation, a muddled mess like a cat's cry, seeming to call his husband but not quite clear.</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was flat. "I don't understand what you're meowing about."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He said blankly, "What meow? There isn't any, I'm just talking to you."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, "What do you call me?"</p><p>This was like public execution. Jiang Juan looked down at his hand and slowly repeated, "...husband."</p><p>It seemed Xue Fangli still didn't hear clearly. He asked Jiang Juan again, "Meowing what now?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>He suspected the prince was doing this on purpose. This time he didn't repeat honestly but said softly, "Bastard, I'm calling you bastard."</p><p>Xue Fangli finally turned around and looked down at Jiang Juan. Though he had been cursed, his expression showed no displeasure; even the earlier sharpness and malice had faded significantly.</p><p>"Not get away with it?" Jiang Juan blinked. "What if I call you 'husband' many more times?"</p><p>"Husband, husband, husband."</p><p>It was easier after the first time, but Jiang Juan still felt a little embarrassed. He tried hard to control himself, though his eyes kept darting around.</p><p>The young man's voice was light and soft, truly like a cat meowing endlessly by one's ear, so cute. But Jiang Juan was completely unaware of it, with innocent, clean eyes.</p><p>He was irritated to the point where he realized it was actually himself who had been trying to console. Why bother?</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze, pinching Jiang Juan's chin and said calmly, "Remember this, there won't be a next time."</p><p>"If you dare to put yourself in danger again and recklessly save people, His Majesty will have no choice but..."</p><p>"to lock you up."</p><p>He was unwilling to see the teenager cry; if the youth remained obstinate and refused to repent, his pitiful cries would not soften his heart.</p><p>In a tone close to warning, Jiang Juan did not take it to heart. He sensed that the Prince was not holding a grudge against him. Since the Prince had conceded, he should properly apologize.</p><p>"I was too hasty," Jiang Juan said, "it won't happen again."</p><p>After saying this, Jiang Juan raised his head and asked expectantly, "Then... Your Majesty, does that mean we're reconciled?"</p><p>He had nodded in agreement, but upon hearing the term "Your Majesty," Xue Fangli merely smiled slightly, "Who knows, let's see."</p><p>Let's see.</p><p>What more was there to say?</p><p>Jiang Juan did not like this answer. He complained, "Your Majesty, you still say I'm hard to console. Clearly, you are harder to console and more troublesome."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow at him and asked, "When have you ever consoled His Majesty?"</p><p>Jiang Juan scratched his head and said openly, "Your Majesty, if I don't walk, you carry me."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him. The youth had always been spoiled, and riding horses had injured his leg. He was likely in unbearable pain, which prompted him to ask for a carry. Xue Fangli carried him as requested, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Didn't I fool you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked with a hint of a smile, "Why does holding you make it seem like you're fooling this king?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied confidently, "Isn't it because you always want to hold &#59114;? You even say you can't let go. So isn't holding you the same as fooling you?"</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan added, "Your Highness, will you give medicine to &#59114; later?"</p><p>In fact, though the king was angry, Jiang Juan felt wronged.</p><p>It wasn't his fault that they had fallen into the water. Why was the king so furious and unwilling to speak to him?</p><p>Couldn't the king just talk to him properly?</p><p>He wasn't unresponsive; he was reasonable.</p><p>Even though they were supposedly reconciled—Jiang Juan believed it unilaterally, while the king hadn't conceded—Jiang Juan still felt aggrieved about telling him to go back for medicine earlier.</p><p>Usually, it was the king who gave him the medicine.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't bear this injustice.</p><p>Thinking here, Jiang Juan decided on his own, "Alright, Your Highness, you do it. You give medicine to &#59114;."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before slowly asking, "Are you sure you want this king to give you the medicine?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't say anything else and simply asked Jiang Juan, "Shall we go back now?"</p><p>But Jiang Juan persisted, "Will you, Your Highness?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said, “Didn’t I fool you?”</p><p>Xue Fangli asked with a hint of a smile, “Why does holding you make it seem like you’re fooling this king?”</p><p>Jiang Juan replied confidently, “Isn’t it because you always want to hold &#59114;? You even say you can't let go. So isn't holding you the same as fooling you?”</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan added, “Your Highness, will you give medicine to &#59114; later?”</p><p>In fact, though the king was angry, Jiang Juan felt wronged.</p><p>It wasn’t his fault that they had fallen into the water. Why was the king so furious and unwilling to speak to him?</p><p>Couldn't the king just talk to him properly?</p><p>He wasn’t unresponsive; he was reasonable.</p><p>Even though they were supposedly reconciled—Jiang Juan believed it unilaterally, while the king hadn’t conceded—Jiang Juan still felt aggrieved about telling him to go back for medicine earlier.</p><p>Usually, it was the king who gave him the medicine.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't bear this injustice.</p><p>Thinking here, Jiang Juan decided on his own, “Alright, Your Highness, you do it. You give medicine to &#59114;.”</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before slowly asking, “Are you sure you want this king to give you the medicine?”</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, “Yes.”</p><p>Xue Fangli didn’t say anything else and simply asked Jiang Juan, “Shall we go back now?”</p><p>But Jiang Juan persisted, “Will you, Your Highness?”</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Didn't I already fool you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a wry smile, "Then why does holding you make it seem like you're the one fooling this king?"</p><p>Jiang Juan retorted firmly, "Isn't it because you always want to hold &#59114;? You even say you can't let go. So isn't that considered fooling me?"</p><p>After a moment, Jiang Juan added, "Your Highness, will you please give medicine to &#59114; later?"</p><p>In reality, though the king was furious, Jiang Juan felt deeply wronged.</p><p>It wasn't his fault they had fallen into the water. Why was the king so angry and refusing to speak with him?</p><p>Couldn't the king just communicate properly?</p><p>He wasn't unresponsive; he was reasonable.</p><p>Even though they were supposedly reconciled—Jiang Juan believed it unilaterally, while the king hadn’t conceded—he still felt resentful about telling him to go back for medicine earlier.</p><p>Usually, it was the king who administered the medicine.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't bear this injustice any longer.</p><p>At this point, Jiang Juan made his decision, "Alright, Your Highness, you do it. You give medicine to &#59114;."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before slowly inquiring, "Are you sure you want me, the king, to give you the medicine?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded firmly, "Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli said nothing further and simply asked, "Shall we go back now?"</p><p>But Jiang Juan persisted, "Will you do it, Your Highness?"</p><p>"It was the horse you brought to ride that got injured. Shouldn't you be responsible for it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli still didn't respond. Jiang Juan wrapped her arms around his neck and noticed that the Prince seemed to enjoy being called husband, so she did so again, "Husband, say something."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>The cat he raised started meowing.</p><p>"You have no regrets," Xue Fangli said with a forced smile, "crying and complaining later that this Wang didn't touch it."</p><p>Jiang Juan swore sincerely, "I wouldn't do that."</p><p>Xue Fangli snorted, "Better not."</p><p>Seeing the Prince's agreement as assent, Jiang Juan happily laid her head on his shoulder and said, "Prince, let's go back quickly."</p><p>When she needed something from him, he was called husband; when there was nothing to ask for, he reverted to being Prince. Xue Fangli tightened his grip on Jiang Juan's waist in a punitive manner, but his lips curled up.</p><p>"Take the cat with you too."</p><p>After walking a few steps, Xue Fangli turned and ordered the servant girl without looking back.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, unsure as she asked him, "Prince, why take the cat?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Didn't you raise it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Just raising it?"</p><p>Shaking his head, Jiang Juan said considerately, "If you don't like cats, Prince, that's fine. You don't have to keep one; it's no big deal. There are other things to play with."</p><p>"Not unlikable," Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Would this Wang not love his own cat?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him, and Xue Fanglei's expression remained unchanged as he said: "Well, if you must take care of it, just know that you have a heart condition and shouldn't be too overexerted. As for the cat, someone in the manor will take care of it. You can play with it occasionally, but don't hold it, and definitely don't let it onto the bed."</p><p>What's so tiring about taking care of a cat?</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't quite understand, but since the Prince asked him to take care of the cat, whatever the Prince said was what he would do.</p><p>As for not holding it or letting it onto the bed, Jiang Juan guessed that the Prince still didn't like cats and disliked cat hair. If he held it or if the cat climbed onto the bed, he would be covered in cat hair.</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately agreed, "Okay, I won't hold it, and I won't let it on the bed."</p><p>It seemed that Xue Fanglei's refusal for him to hold the cat and not allowing it on the bed was purely because Jiang Juan shouldn't be distracted too much.</p><p>The cat was something Xue Congjun had won from someone, and before this, he said Xue Congjun would take care of it and bring it to play with him when the Prince wasn't around. Now that the Prince had changed his mind, Jiang Juan told Xue Congjun, "Can I take the cat back to the manor?"</p><p>Xue Congjun generously waved his hand, "Of course."</p><p>Jiang Juan thanked him and then said goodbye to him before curling up again in Xue Fanglei's arms, signaling that he should leave. Just as he was leaving, Xue Fanglei glanced at Xue Congjun with a calm expression and left him with a casual remark.</p><p>"You don't need to pull out the fur from the rug anymore."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "???"</p><p>He enjoyed his punishment immensely, and not being punished also made him feel good.</p><p>Did his fifth brother have no sense of propriety at all?</p><p>Xue Congjun's head was filled with question marks. He dared not ask Xue Fanglei, so he held it in until he left before turning to the other two and asking, "What's going on with my fifth brother? He acts strangely—just now he punished me for pulling out the fur from the rug, and a moment later, he stopped punishing me. What is he up to?"</p><p>Gu Puwang calmly said, "You should thank the Princess Consort. If not for him, saying anything about the rug would have cost you your life today."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "???"</p><p>What the heck? Why did she protect Xie Juan?</p><p>Xue Congyun couldn't understand, "What did Xie Juan do? How did he save her life? What are you talking about?"</p><p>He started with a string of whys. Jiang Qingliang couldn't take it anymore and reminded him, "Just now, you put your hand on his shoulder. Didn't you see the look in your fifth brother's eyes? Everyone thought he would order someone to chop off both of your hands."</p><p>Mentioning this, Xue Congyun also got angry. He said doubtfully, "It was just putting a hand on his shoulder. Why did my fifth brother glare at him? It was just putting a hand on his shoulder. Was it worth that much?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said helplessly, "Didn't you see how much your fifth brother dotes on Xie Juan? Forget about how he made Mei Fei angry. He didn't even want Xie Juan to walk the road alone and even got jealous of him even with a cat, not allowing him to hug her or sleep with her."</p><p>Xue Congyun was shocked, "What are you talking about? Doesn't my fifth brother always bully Xie Juan?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang replied, "Your fifth brother should be willing to bully others."</p><p>Xue Congyun said, "No, listen to me. Every time he sees Xie Juan, it's either handprints from his fifth brother squeezing him or a foot injury that makes him unable to walk. He's constantly injured everywhere. Isn't this torture by my fifth brother?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Gu Puwang: "..."</p><p>"You—"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang struggled to say, "Just calm down. What kind of person would your fifth brother torture without bloodshed? How could he just leave handprints unless... "</p><p>Xue Congyun was struck by lightning upon hearing this.</p><p>Yes, his fifth brother really didn't like Xie Juan. He had long chased him away and wouldn't keep him under his nose to torture him.</p><p>Moreover, in a normal situation, if his fifth brother really tortured someone, the force wouldn't be so light that it only left handprints; he could have just severed his hands.</p><p>Therefore, there was only one truth.</p><p>He was fighting on the bed.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "..."</p><p>Xue Congyun: "???"</p><p>He suddenly realized it, then froze like a wooden chicken, finally his mindset collapsed, "Why does Five Brother always come up with different ways to torment Juan Brother every time I go to look for him?"</p><p>"He is still being tormented even when he's out—how could Juan Brother not know what kind of torture he's been subjected to. I've been worrying all day that he can't take it anymore, and whenever I have the chance, I'll run over to give him his favorite toys."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Congyun choked up once, "The fool is actually... himself."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang not only had no sympathy but also burst into laughter right away, "Hahahaha, you don't know how Juan Brother has been tortured—entering and leaving are carried by the Prince, meals are fed to him by the Prince. Juan Brother must have been tormented terribly! He can't take it anymore!"</p><p>Xue Congyun let out a sobbing cry, "How foolish, why is he so foolish..."</p><p>The next day when his Five Brother was not around, he rushed to Li Wangfu and viciously—</p><p>Threw another favorite toy at Juan Brother and forced him to be his top friend.</p><p>Wuuuuh.</p><p>He really got hurt.</p><p>What could ease his worries? Only being Juan Brother's top friend.</p><p>Otherwise, he would definitely cause a big fuss!</p><p>Returning to the tent, Jiang Juan was placed on the bed. He sat up, slowly rolling up his pants, "Prince, apply medicine."</p><p>He bent down to take a look and gently touched the wound. A patch of his inner thigh was rubbed raw and it hurt quite a bit.</p><p>Xue Fangli fetched some ointment, glancing at Jiang Juan. His originally snow-white skin now had a flush of redness, and the injury was rather shocking to see.</p><p>"Put your leg up."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke slowly. Jiang Juan hesitated but didn’t move. Xue Fangli then gripped Jiang Juan’s ankle, placing one of his legs on the armrest so he could apply the ointment.</p><p>Jiang Juan said sheepishly, “Zhěnme … perhaps you should just … treat yourself?”</p><p>Xue Fangli replied without any expression, "Forgot what you said earlier?"</p><p>Jiang Juan clenched the soft cushion on the bed and nervously said, “Shì zhè hé bèibù 、shǒujiao shòujiàng bù yīyàng.”</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly asked him, "How is it different?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was suddenly caught off guard. He blinked but didn’t answer. Xue Fangli waited for a moment, his fingers dipped in the ointment, and began to apply it.</p><p>His fingertips touched the wound, and Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>He bent down to inspect the wound and gently touched the damaged area. A patch of his inner thigh was rubbed raw, causing considerable pain.</p><p>Xue Fangli fetched some ointment and glanced at Jiang Juan. His originally flawless skin now had a red flush, making the injury look rather shocking.</p><p>"Put your leg up," Xue Fangli said slowly. Jiang Juan hesitated but didn't move. Xue Fangli then grabbed Jiang Juan’s ankle, lifting one of his legs onto the armrest to apply the ointment.</p><p>Realizing this, Jiang Juan lowered his leg, but Xue Fangli’s hand still gripped his ankle tightly. Jiang Juan could only wiggle slightly. Xue Fangli raised his eyes and asked calmly, "What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said sheepishly, “Maybe you should just … treat yourself?”</p><p>Xue Fangli replied expressionlessly, "Forgot what you said earlier?"</p><p>Jiang Juan clutched the soft cushion on the bed and nervously said, “This is different from injuries to your back or limbs.”</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly asked him, "How is it different?"</p><p>Caught off guard, Jiang Juan blinked but didn’t answer. Xue Fangli waited for a moment, dipped his fingers in the ointment, and began to apply it.</p><p>His fingertips touched the wound, causing Jiang Juan’s eyelashes to twitch.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>He bent down to examine the wound and gently touched the damaged area. A patch of his inner thigh was rubbed raw, causing considerable pain.</p><p>Xue Fangli fetched some ointment and glanced at Jiang Juan. His originally flawless skin now had a red flush, making the injury look rather shocking.</p><p>"Put your leg up," Xue Fangli said slowly. Jiang Juan hesitated but didn't move. Xue Fangli then grabbed Jiang Juan’s ankle, lifting one of his legs onto the armrest to apply the ointment.</p><p>This position was truly awkward. Initially, Jiang Juan hadn’t regretted letting the prince treat him, but now he suddenly realized he might have been too hasty. After all, the injury was quite exposed.</p><p>Realizing this, Jiang Juan lowered his leg, but Xue Fangli’s hand still gripped his ankle tightly. Jiang Juan could only wiggle slightly. Xue Fangli raised his eyes and asked calmly, "What is it?"</p><p>His tone was calm, yet there was a deep darkness in his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Juan said sheepishly, “Maybe you should just treat yourself?”</p><p>Xue Fangli replied expressionlessly, "Forgot what you said earlier?"</p><p>Jiang Juan clutched the soft cushion on the bed and nervously said, “This is different from injuries to your back or limbs.”</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly asked him, "How is it different?"</p><p>Caught off guard, Jiang Juan blinked but didn’t answer. Xue Fangli waited for a moment, dipped his fingers in the ointment, and began to apply it.</p><p>His fingertips touched the wound, causing Jiang Juan’s eyelashes to twitch.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>Xue Fangli moved gently and tenderly, yet even so, the broken skin was unbearable for Jiang Juan. He lightly inhaled, "Prince, it hurts, really hurts. Be gentler."</p><p>Xue Fangli lightened his touch, almost caressing his skin, but Jiang Juan still couldn’t handle it. He shook his head fiercely, "Prince, it still hurts, really hurts."</p><p>He kept shouting in pain, and Xue Fangli could no longer apply medicine to him. Lowering his eyelids for a moment, Xue Fangli applied a lot of ointment to Jiang Juan's wound and then slowly lowered his head.</p><p>The next moment, he felt moisture approaching.</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched. Initially clenched in pain around the soft cushion, they now clenched tightly due to itching. Suddenly realizing something, his body stiffened.</p><p>It was his tongue.</p><p>The Prince was using his tongue to spread the ointment.</p><p>A barely perceptible sensation, the tip of his tongue brushed past lightly as if a feather; this time there was no pain—it was intense itching.</p><p>Jiang Juan gently pushed him, "Prince, you don't need to do this. Using your hand would be fine; the pain—"</p><p>This push caused Xue Fangli to lose some strength, and Jiang Juan nearly cried out in pain, "Really, really."</p><p>Ordinarily indifferent, Xue Fangli knew all too well how delicate and afraid of pain the young man was. He couldn't bear pain, but perhaps he sensed something. Xue Fangli suddenly raised his lips slightly and looked up thoughtfully.</p><p>"Pain can be endured?"</p><p>He repeated this, then nodded to Jiang Juan and spread the ointment on the wounded area as requested.</p><p>Perhaps due to comparison, no matter what, every push of the ointment made Jiang Juan feel even more pain than before. He endured it repeatedly, his eyes watering profusely; he could barely bear it anymore and took a deep breath lightly.</p><p>"Pain?"</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped the motion, asking Jiang Juan with a smile.</p><p>Having bravely said that pain can be endured, Jiang Juan slowly nodded. Xue Fangli asked calmly, "If it hurts, shall we switch back?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was hesitant. Seeing this, Xue Fangli continued applying the medicine, using some force with his fingertips on the soft skin like snow. Immediately, Jiang Juan felt his scalp numb in pain. He couldn't bear it anymore and said softly, "It really hurts, Prince, switch back, please switch back."</p><p>This time, Xue Fangli did not indulge his desire.</p><p>"Change also."</p><p>His tongue gently touched the side of his cheek, still faintly retaining the sweet scent of the young man's skin. Xue Fangli savored it for a long moment, smiling carelessly, "I went through all the trouble to medicate you; shouldn't I at least ask for some compensation?"</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly at him, "What kind of compensation?"</p><p>Xue Fangli pinched his jaw, lowering his gaze. He met Jiang Juan's eyes and gently touched the young man's lips with his clean fingers, "What do you say?"</p>
