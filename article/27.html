						<p>His hand was still in Xue Fangli's. Upon hearing this, Xue Fangli suddenly clenched tightly.</p><p>Jiang Juan lightly drew a breath and slowly said, "Your Highness, aren't we fine? You can pinch, just be gentle."</p><p>He winced from the pain but didn't complain much, only softly reminding Xue Fangli, "You used too much strength again."</p><p>Too much strength?</p><p>It was just that he was too afraid of pain and too delicate.</p><p>Xue Fangli said nothing, only staring at Jiang Juan. After a long while, he spoke in an exceptionally gentle tone, "I'm sorry, Your Highness forgot."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a single "Mn." He acted like a dead fish, not bothering to argue with the Young Master, then added, "Your Highness, I'll take care of you too."</p><p>Previously, it had been him, this dead fish, lying flat while the Young Master supported him. Today, he helped the Young Master teach a lesson to those who were being loudmouthed and obnoxious. Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli with sparkling eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli was momentarily stunned, his lips curling into a light smile. "Thank you."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli slowly continued, "Don't do it yourself next time. Since you're afraid of pain, there are guards in the manor who aren't just decorations."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He found it hard to describe his feelings right now.</p><p>Was the Young Master very good?</p><p>He didn't care what you thought.</p><p>But...</p><p>It seemed that Jiang Juan was quite attentive as a queen consort.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang thought to himself. If he were also trusted wholeheartedly by such a little beauty, how could he not believe her? Damn it, he was even afraid that she would hurt his hand.</p><p>No way, this is a dangerous idea.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang shook his head dazedly; he had been staring at Jiang Juan for quite some time. Just then, Xue Fangli's half-smiling eyes seemed about to break into laughter, causing Jiang Qingliang to shudder.</p><p>He dared not think if the Prince was okay or not, but he knew that if he kept looking, the Prince would definitely tear him apart.</p><p>With a splash, Jiang Qingliang dove into the water and sadly searched for the nonexistent bracelet.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli, "Prince, how did you come?"</p><p>"To find you," Xue Fangli replied with a half-smile, "I didn't want to wake you up earlier. I wanted to wait until you woke up before asking the abbot to come over, but since this prince wasn't here, you came out."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Seeing his intentions exposed, Jiang Juan blinked and earnestly defended himself, "The ceremony hasn't ended yet; I just wanted to take a look."</p><p>"Go in and take a look then."</p><p>With that said, Xue Fangli stepped into the temple. Jiang Juan was taken aback and asked, "Prince, didn't you not want to come?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied calmly, "This prince doesn't want to, but since you've come so many times, it's okay for you to come."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh" and followed him inside the ceremony.</p><p>Inside the temple, many monks were sitting on the ground, reciting scriptures in low voices. Jiang Juan listened for a while but couldn't understand much. Thinking he might as well see what was going on since he was already there, he decided to pick up a few incense sticks and pay his respects.</p><p>Jiang Juan had only a vague idea of what happened at the Garden of the Beautiful Lady, but no matter what, she was unfortunate. He held the incense, closed his eyes,</p><p>Xue Fangli did not obstruct or join him in incense burning, but only watched from afar.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head. His brow was slightly furrowed, and his face seemed to be shrouded in the blue smoke, yet his expression of sympathy and compassion was not concealed at all. He focused and devoutly prayed for beauty Yumei.</p><p>Watching on, Xue Fangli's expression turned cold.</p><p>How could he forget, this was his Little Bodhisattva, not just his own Little Bodhisattva.</p><p>His compassion did not belong to him alone. As long as there was suffering, anything could make him sympathize and soften his heart.</p><p>It was true for wolves, even more so for peacocks, and even for people he had never met.</p><p>Xue Fangli loved how soft Jiang Juan's heart was and how adept he was at using his softness to manipulate him. At this moment, Xue Fangli detested Jiang Juan's softness the most.</p><p>Because this softness and focus were not unique to him; he could not possess them alone.</p><p>The boy had a pure heart and a bodhisattva-like nature, something Xue Fangli had already known.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes slightly, suppressing some of his displeasure and dissatisfaction, and smiled as he gazed at Jiang Juan.</p><p>Perhaps that woman was right.</p><p>To keep someone, to make them fear and rely on him alone for survival, becoming a parasite.</p><p>But he wanted to keep a Little Bodhisattva. The Little Bodhisattva did not know his true nature, fearless and unafraid, he might be timid and spoiled, but he would never be a parasite; his heart held too many things.</p><p>Too many, too many.</p><p>He loved too much, he sympathized too much.</p><p>The brutality deep in his soul raged fiercely, Xue Fangli barely managed to restrain it.</p><p>"Your Highness, nǐ hǎo."</p><p>After completing the incense ritual, Jiāng Juàn moved to Xue Fànglí's side and asked, "Are you leaving now?"</p><p>Xue Fànglí looked at him, who was just a short distance away, and suddenly asked, "She… my mother, don't you want to ask anything?"</p><p>Jiāng Juàn hesitated and said, "I wanted to ask, but..."</p><p>He had so many questions, but he was afraid that asking would make Your Highness unhappy, so he held back and planned to wait until he knew how to approach it.</p><p>The previous time, he directly went on the anniversary of her death, and Your Highness didn't appear for several days. Jiāng Juàn felt he needed to be more cautious.</p><p>Xue Fànglí glanced at him a few times and said calmly, "Jiǎng Qīngliáng, what do you know?"</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he laughed mockingly, his eyes cold and bitter, "Whether she comes or goes, it's either me killing her or wanting to burn her alive."</p><p>Jiāng Juàn was stunned and nodded slightly before hurriedly adding, "But I know it won't be Your Highness."</p><p>"What if it were me?"</p><p>Xue Fànglí raised his eyelids. His voice was low and carried a coldly vicious tone, "Do you know how much I hate her?"</p><p>"I wish to eat her flesh raw and drink her blood raw."</p><p>In Jiāng Juàn's eyes, Your Highness was usually gentle, only occasionally indifferent when in a bad mood. However, this moment of savagery was the first time he had ever seen.</p><p>He was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say, looking at Xue Fànglí blankly.</p><p>His gaze remained clear as before; his entire soul seemed clean to an extreme, free from any dust.</p><p>Xue Fànglí looked away from Jiāng Juàn. His rage almost solidified into something real. He suddenly felt tired of this game of pretending to be good.</p><p>He should make him fear himself.</p><p>He should turn him into a canary.</p><p>No matter how much he had inside his heart, if you broke his wings and locked him in a beautiful cage, all he could do was watch him alone, pitying him alone.</p><p>"Prince... "</p><p>"Go. "</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, suddenly not wanting to hear anything more from him, nor did he want to see him—no matter what kind of gaze Jiang Juan cast, it would never be the one he wanted.</p><p>Xue Fangli indifferently raised his foot, and Jiang Juan instinctively grabbed his sleeve. "Prince, wait a moment."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not lift his head to look at him, but his steps paused. Jiang Juan returned to the brazier, lowered his head, and reached out his hand.</p><p>Jiang Juan quickly retracted it, saying, "Prince, let's go."</p><p>His tone was as usual, yet for some reason, Xue Fangli still glanced over at him.</p><p>Jiang Juan was pursing his lips, with his eyelashes gently drooping, wetting a small cluster of hair as if dew were clinging to it.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked for a long time before finally lowering his eyelids and asked, "Did you get scared just now?"</p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Juan shook his head. "No... just..."</p><p>Just what? He did not finish his sentence, Xue Fangli waited for a moment, and frustration surged again. Without any expression, he said, "Let's go."</p><p>They walked one in front of the other out of the cottage.</p><p>The abbot had already been called over, and the high attendant was serving him tea. Seeing them arrive, the high attendant hurriedly said, "Prince, Princess."</p><p>Xue Fali did not respond, but Jiang Juan gave a faint response with low spirits. Gao Jishu looked at him and smiled: "Princess, this is the abbot of Miaolin Temple."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned to look, and the abbot put down his tea cup, smiling, "May I take your pulse, Princess?"</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a "hum" and gave him one hand. The abbot placed his hand on it, and after a moment, he softly said, "From the pulse reading, Princess, your vitality is waning and you seem to have innate deficiencies. You must be well-cared for and not slack off."</p><p>The abbot was quite skilled in traditional medicine, but noticing Jiang Juan's poor mood, he added, "Besides proper care, Princess, it's also important to maintain a clear state of mind."</p><p>Pausing for a moment, the abbot continued, "His Highness mentioned that Princess has frequent chest pains and even fainted once today. May I help you with some acupuncture to unblock your meridians?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>He felt he didn't need any acupressure.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at Xue Fali, but Xue Fali simply sat quietly with his eyes lowered, not looking at him. Jiang Juan was forced into the situation.</p><p>"The Great Yang point has effects of calming the mind and spirit and regulating qi in the chest. Princess, I will perform acupuncture on you at this point today."</p><p>The Great Yang point is located on the back; to administer acupuncture here, he would need to strip his clothes down to the shoulder blades. Jiang Juan slowly untied his clothing, then slowly pulled it down.</p><p>Just as his fair and round shoulders were about to be revealed, a hand forcefully held him back, preventing him from pulling it further. Xue Fali calmly said, "Gao De, go out."</p><p>Gao Jishu, who had been lowering his head not daring to look around, breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, "Yes, His Highness."</p><p>"Lie on the bed first."</p><p>Xue Fali spoke coldly again. Jiang Juan gave him a wary glance and lay down nervously. Xue Fali then pulled off his clothes.</p><p>His bare back was snow-white and radiant, with a scattering of black hair, making it look even more lustrous.</p><p>Xue Fali paused in his actions.</p><p>"Your Highness, do you really not feel any pain?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was extremely afraid. He placed both hands on the pillow and looked up at Xue Fangli. Because of his movement, his hair fell from the back of his head, revealing a beautiful and slender neck.</p><p>Xue Fangli did not say anything; he just stared at Jiang Juan.</p><p>"...Your Highness?"</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent. Jiang Juan became even more afraid and could not help but call out to him. After some time, Xue Fangli said, "Mm, it doesn't hurt."</p><p>Jiang Juan believed him.</p><p>However, the next second, as the abbot began acupuncture, the pain in his back made Jiang Juan take a sharp breath. His fingers unconsciously clenched the pillow.</p><p>It was better that he did not clench; doing so caused Jiang Juan's eyelashes to tremble and water droplets to form.</p><p>"...It hurts."</p><p>Jiang Juan involuntarily curled up his left hand, enduring all along but finally unable to hold it in as tears fell one by one.</p><p>No matter how much pain he feared, acupuncture should not be this painful. Xue Fangli looked down at him and suddenly seemed to see something, grabbing Jiang Juan's left wrist.</p><p>There were several blisters on the fingertips of this hand, which he accidentally pressed and broke.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"Just now... Your Highness you hated Yu Mei, so you took all the incense off her."</p><p>Jiang Juan was in extreme pain, his eyelashes trembling fiercely as tears fell non-stop. He stuttered, "But I accidentally burned myself..."</p><p>"Your Highness, I'm sorry. I didn't know you disliked her."</p>
