						<p>It seemed like a long time had passed, yet it felt like just an instant.</p><p>The long night gradually brightened as consciousness began to return. Jiang Juan faced the glaring lights, everything bathed in brightness akin to daylight.</p><p>"Beep, beep, beep—"</p><p>Instruments emitted urgent and sharp sounds. Jiang Juan heard several voices.</p><p>"Teacher, he’s bleeding again! The bleeding won’t stop, it simply can’t be stopped!"</p><p>"Heart rate is irregular, the patient's heart rate is too low!"</p><p>"Teacher—he has stopped beating!"</p><p>Jiang Juan struggled to open his eyes, but he had no strength at all. He clearly felt life force draining away. Jiang Juan felt tired and cold.</p><p>It’s better to keep sleeping.</p><p>When asleep, I won’t feel tired, and I won’t feel cold.</p><p>Thinking this way, Jiang Juan gave up resistance.</p><p>Those sounds—the beeping of instruments, anxious cries, and hurried footsteps—faded from his ears, and Jiang Juan once again fell into darkness.</p><p>Consciousness scattered in the silence.</p><p>Floating.</p><p>"You have an extremely good life force; you can be called a prosperous soul. It’s just that your destiny is fated with three calamities."</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched slightly.</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>It seems like he has heard this sentence before.</p><p>"In the first calamity, you were hanging by a thread, but then fortune turned in your favor. In the second calamity, you bore grudges and grievances, yet your life was spared. The third calamity..."</p><p>What happened with the third calamity?</p><p>Scattered consciousness reconverged, and Jiang Juan could not help but be drawn into these words, struggling to think.</p><p>Calamities.</p><p>His calamities.</p><p>Was it his heart disease?</p><p>No.</p><p>That's not right.</p><p>Since he was born, there has been a problem with his heart. He received so many critical condition notices that they could be bound into a book. If it were his heart disease, there would have been more than three times.</p><p>Then what could it be?</p><p>Jiang Juan strained to think hard.</p><p>He felt like he had forgotten something important, but whatever he had forgotten was crucial; he shouldn't forget and must not forget.</p><p>What did he forget?</p><p>What exactly was it?</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>It seems he has heard this sentence before.</p><p>"In the first calamity, you were hanging by a thread, but fortune turned in your favor. In the second calamity, you bore grudges and grievances, yet your life was spared. The third calamity..."</p><p>What happened in the third calamity?</p><p>Scattered consciousness reconverged, and Jiang Juan could not help but be drawn into these words, struggling to think.</p><p>Calamities.</p><p>His calamities.</p><p>Was it his heart disease?</p><p>No.</p><p>That's not right.</p><p>Since birth, he has had heart problems. He received so many critical condition notices they could fill a book. If it were his heart disease, there would have been more than three episodes.</p><p>What then was it?</p><p>Jiang Juan strained to think hard.</p><p>He felt like he had forgotten something important, but whatever he had remembered was crucial; he shouldn't forget and must not forget.</p><p>What did he forget?</p><p>What exactly was it?</p><p>Who is this person?</p><p>It seems he has heard this sentence before.</p><p>"In the first trial, you hung by a thread, but fortune turned in your favor. In the second trial, you bore grudges and grievances, yet your life was spared. The third trial..."</p><p>What happened in the third trial?</p><p>His scattered consciousness reconverged, and Jiang Juan could not help but be drawn into these words, struggling to think.</p><p>Trials.</p><p>His trials.</p><p>Was it his heart disease?</p><p>No.</p><p>That's not right.</p><p>Since birth, he has had heart issues. He received so many critical condition notices they could fill a book. If it were his heart disease, there would have been more than three episodes.</p><p>What then was the third trial about?</p><p>Jiang Juan strained to think hard.</p><p>He felt like he had forgotten something important, but whatever he had remembered was crucial; he shouldn't forget and must not forget.</p><p>What did he forget?</p><p>What exactly was it?</p><p>Jiang Juan was very anxious.</p><p>He was exhausted, his entire body devoid of strength. Hypothermia made him feel cold, and he could not stop shivering. He felt like a leaf swept into the ocean by the wind, tossed by waves and crashing tides, being carried away to distant, unknown places.</p><p>Think quickly.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>The sound of hurried footsteps and the rapid beeping of instruments echoed in his ears again. Jiang Juan heard many people speaking to him.</p><p>"Don't sleep."</p><p>"Hang on a bit longer, just a bit more."</p><p>"You were saved during your first attempt, you can do it this time too. Your future is long ahead, and your family is waiting for you. Don't give up."</p><p>Don't sleep.</p><p>He still couldn't remember anything; nothing came back to him.</p><p>He couldn't afford to sleep.</p><p>He had to recall what he had forgotten, because the things he forgot were truly important.</p><p>Jiang Juan repeatedly told himself this and struggled desperately.</p><p>After an unknown duration of time, in the endless darkness, faint glimmers began to appear. They danced continuously until they coalesced into a single beam, and Jiang Juan saw light once more.</p><p>A trembling, bright light.</p><p>At that very moment, Jiang Juan finally remembered what he had forgotten.</p><p>He promised someone he would not leave him.</p><p>He promised Xue Fangli that he would not leave him.</p><p>"The surgery was successful."</p><p>This was the last thing Jiang Juan heard before she lost consciousness.</p><p>When she woke up again, it was ten days later.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat up dazedly. She tried to recognize her surroundings, confirming that this was a completely unfamiliar place. She touched her heart, finding no trace of any surgical incision.</p><p>Was it all just a dream?</p><p>She returned to the operating table. The situation was still critical, but the surgery was successful in the end.</p><p>"You're awake."</p><p>With a creak, someone opened the door. An old man wearing tattered robes walked in with his hands behind his back, swaying slightly. Jiang Juan looked up and immediately recognized him.</p><p>"Master Ananda..."</p><p>Ananda waved her hand and asked Jiang Juan, "How do you feel?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated, "Alright."</p><p>Ananda nodded, "That's good then."</p><p>Jiang Juan had many questions for him but didn't know where to start, so she fell silent.</p><p>Ananda gazed at Jiang Juan. There was no longer the shrewdness of a fraudster who asked her to pay money to avoid disaster on his face last time. Instead, his eyes were filled with all-seeing wisdom. Ananda smiled and said, "Is this monk a liar? Your physical condition is weak, and your spirit is unsteady."</p><p>He had promised someone he would not abandon him.</p><p>He had promised Xue Fangli that he would not leave him.</p><p>“The surgery was successful.”</p><p>These were the last words Jiang Juan heard before she lost consciousness.</p><p>When she woke up again, it was ten days later.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat up dazedly.

An old man wearing tattered robes walked in with his hands behind his back, swaying slightly. Jiang Juan looked up and immediately recognized him.</p><p>“Master Ananda…”</p><p>Ananda waved her hand and asked Jiang Juan, “How do you feel?”</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated, “Alright.”</p><p>Ananda nodded, “That’s good then.”</p><p>Jiang Juan had many questions for him but didn’t know where to start, so she fell silent.</p><p>Ananda gazed at Jiang Juan.

She realized this was an entirely unfamiliar place. Touching her heart, she found no sign of any surgical incision.</p><p>Was it all just a dream?</p><p>She imagined herself back on the operating table. The situation had been critical, but in the end, the surgery had succeeded.</p><p>“You’re awake,” someone said.</p><p>With a creak, the door opened. An old man wearing tattered robes entered, his hands clasped behind his back, swaying slightly. Jiang Juan looked up and immediately recognized him.</p><p>“Master Ananda…”</p><p>Ananda waved her hand and asked, “How do you feel?”</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated, “Alright.”</p><p>Ananda nodded, “That’s good then.”</p><p>Jiang Juan had many questions for him but didn’t know where to start, so she fell silent.</p><p>Ananda gazed at Jiang Juan. Gone was the shrewdness of a fraudster who asked her to pay money to avoid disaster as he did last time. His eyes now held an all-seeing wisdom. Ananda smiled and said, “Is this monk a liar? Your physical condition is weak, and your spirit is unsteady.”</p><p>"... It seems so."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Did you save me?"</p><p>Anan replied, "You saved yourself."</p><p>"On the Mirror Flower Tower, if it were not for the benefactor's mercy on our lonely and helpless old man and young boy, the second calamity would have been unresolvable. If it were not for the benefactor's pity on my disciple's small and frail frame, giving him a piece of broken silver, he would not have guided others."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. Anan continued, "The benefactor must not be from around here. You should return. The poor monk did not wish to see you and did not want to take action, but..."</p><p>His voice paused, and Anan's expression was rather strange as if he recalled an unhappy memory.</p><p>That day, the man came to his thatch-roofed cottage, his eyes red with blood, his expression ferocious beyond measure. He stared at Anan, like a demon crawled out from a den of ghosts, terrifying to behold.</p><p>"Make him wake up."</p><p>The man casually spoke, each word carrying a whiff of blood, the warning obvious without needing to be stated.</p><p>A knife was pressed against Anan's neck; if Anan refused, it would be immediately slit. What could Anan say? He could only sigh, "Forget it, the good causes he sowed will naturally bear good fruit."</p><p>Thinking of this, Anan slowly said, "The benefactor and His Majesty have a deep love, moved to my heart, I thus offered assistance."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "My spirit was unstable. Did you help me stabilize it?"</p><p>Anan did not immediately answer but looked at Jiang Juan's wrist. Jiang Juan lowered his head and only then noticed that he was wearing a red string with an irregular bead strung on it.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>"It's a good thing. You will have to return it one day."</p><p>Jiang Juan fiddled with it, Anan said with a pained face, "Be gentle, be gentle."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Can't we play?"</p><p>Anan: "..."</p><p>Without any context, Anan said, "I just fear that he might come to visit, tease him a bit, and in the end, Shenshou turned into Ganshen, he actually destroyed the shrine and took the patriarch's sarira to use."</p><p>Sarira?</p><p>Jiang Juan understood. He looked at what was on his wrist and suddenly didn't want to touch it anymore.</p><p>Anan continued mumbling, "People can still reason, what is this thing? Reason doesn't work with him, he kills at a whim, just like a ghost, even Buddha would be worried seeing him."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Just mentioning the thing that makes even Buddha worry made Anan's face turn green. He seriously said to Jiang Juan, "Keep him in check. In the future, you must properly suppress evil and don't let him cause trouble everywhere again."</p><p>Jiang Juan could only respond, "I'll try my best."</p><p>Since all that needed to be said was said, Anan waved his sleeves like shooing away flies and said, "Get up and leave quickly when you wake up. If you delay any longer, he might think you're still asleep and destroy my humble abode again."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit embarrassed, "I'm sorry..."</p><p>Knowing that what Anan said was right, if he delayed further, Xue Fangli might really cause trouble for someone else, Jiang Juan got out of bed.</p><p>He supported himself against the wall and took a few steps. Suddenly, Jiang Juan remembered something and asked Anan, "Since I stayed here, where is my home?"</p><p>Anan replied, "When this humble monk retrieves the sarira, that will be your day to return home."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. He had one last question.</p><p>"I read a book, then I ended up in this world. Is all of this just a dream of mine? Or is it... something that really exists?"</p><p>Actually, Jiang Juan didn't know what to say. He seemed to have had a dream that transported him into the world of the book, yet it also felt like a dream that brought him back to what he considered his real world, back to the operating table, even facing a life-threatening situation. "Does Zhou dream of being a butterfly? Or does the butterfly dream of being Zhou?" Ananda smiled. "What is reality? What is illusion?" "Everything is an illusion. All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows; they appear like dew or lightning." And yet, everything is real. Every flower, every leaf, every blade of grass, every tree—what you can touch and perceive exists right here." Jiang Juan was bewildered by what Ananda said. Then Ananda added, "One flower one world, one leaf one Bodhimanda. In the three thousand worlds, wherever your soul is, there lies reality." Jiang Juan seemed to have understood something. "Then...what about the original Jiang Juan?" Ananda smiled mysteriously. "You are always you." After saying that, Ananda told Jiang Juan, "Go, someone is here to pick you up." Jiang Juan nodded and thanked and bid farewell to Ananda before leaving the thatched cottage. Not far away, a tall man with pale and gaunt features had been staring at Jiang Juan intently ever since he came out, his jaw set and lines sharp. "I slept well," Jiang Juan whispered to himself. To him, it was just a nap, but during that time, he lost track of time. However, Xue Fali did not. It had been ten days. During these ten days, Xue Fali had not closed his eyes once, and each night, he suffered from excruciating headaches. The loss tormented him, making him irritable with nowhere to vent his anger except by waiting, and waiting again. Opening his eyelids slightly, Xue Fali looked at Jiang Juan and said calmly, "Come over." "Okay." Jiang Juan smiled and took a few steps forward. Overwhelmed with joy, he suddenly leaped into Xue Fali's arms, hugging him around the waist. "My divine soul is secured."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Have you been waiting long?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Not too long."</p><p>Jiang Juan said again, "I haven't forgotten."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually asked, "What?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly answered, "I won't leave you behind."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes.</p><p>His abnormal behavior was evident; he didn't greet Jiang Juan by pulling her into his embrace as usual. He even refrained from putting an arm around Jiang Juan's waist and simply stared at her.</p><p>Jiang Juan touched his face and earnestly comforted him, "Don't be afraid, I'll stay with you, always."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Are you going anywhere?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "No, except staying by your side, I won't go anywhere else."</p><p>Thinking for a moment, Jiang Juan softly said, "Don't let me go, and I don't want to be left alone either."</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond. Beneath his calm expression, his entire body was shaking, and the emotions hidden in his dark gaze surged fiercely, reaching their peak. A metallic taste spread across his mouth, and Xue Fangli coughed once.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to comfort him again but suddenly got frightened.</p><p>Blood actually dripped from Xue Fangli's lips, bright red and blinding to look at.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Have you been waiting long?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Not too long."</p><p>Jiang Juan added, "I haven't forgotten."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually asked, "What?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly replied, "I won't leave you behind."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes.</p><p>His unusual behavior was clear; he didn't greet Jiang Juan by pulling her into his embrace as usual. He even refrained from putting an arm around Jiang Juan's waist and simply stared at her.</p><p>Jiang Juan touched his face and earnestly comforted him, "Don't be afraid, I'll stay with you, always."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Are you going anywhere?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "No, except staying by your side, I won't go anywhere else."</p><p>After a moment of thought, Jiang Juan softly said, "Don't let me go, and I don't want to be left alone either."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent. Beneath his calm expression, his entire body was trembling, and the emotions hidden in his dark gaze surged fiercely, reaching their peak. A metallic taste spread across his mouth, and Xue Fangli coughed once.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to comfort him again but suddenly got frightened.</p><p>Blood actually dripped from Xue Fangli's lips, bright red and blinding to look at.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Jiang Juan inquired, "Have you been waiting long?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Not too long."</p><p>Jiang Juan continued, "I haven't forgotten."</p><p>Xue Fangli casually asked, "What?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly answered, "I won't leave you behind."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes.</p><p>His unusual behavior was clear; he didn't greet Jiang Juan by pulling her into his embrace as usual. He even refrained from putting an arm around Jiang Juan's waist and simply stared at her.</p><p>Jiang Juan tenderly touched his face, "Don't be afraid, I'll stay with you, always."</p><p>Xue Fangli inquired, "Are you going anywhere?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "No, except staying by your side, I won't go anywhere else."</p><p>After a moment of thought, Jiang Juan softly added, "Don't let me go, and I don't want to be left alone either."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent.

Xue Fangli held his wrist tightly.</p><p>"It was you who said so."</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was hoarse, but his tone was vicious, "Stay by my side; don't go anywhere."</p><p>"This life, next life, the life after that... as long as I have you, I will never let you go."</p>
