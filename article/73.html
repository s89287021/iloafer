						<p>At midnight, the carriage headed toward the palace.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never seen the capital city at dawn and curiously lifted the curtain. It was pitch black outside, with only the imperial guards patrolling in formation.</p><p>As she watched, Jiang Juan's thoughts drifted away again.</p><p>According to the plot, after Emperor Xinghong fell into a coma, he became critically ill. With no one else to choose from, he appointed Crown Prince as regent.</p><p>The Crown Prince then became overly close with Duke Pingan. Due to his talent and loyalty, Duke Pingan was highly favored under him. Later, during the disaster, the Crown Prince sent Duke Pingan southward, which helped establish Duke Pingan's reputation among the common folk.</p><p>However—</p><p>The Crown Prince seemed to have offended the Prince.</p><p>Duke Pingan had also offended the Prince again recently.</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered to herself, "Prince, where is your fiefdom? Why have you never mentioned it before? Otherwise... let's visit your fiefdom tomorrow."</p><p>"No, not tomorrow. After seeing the Emperor, why don't we leave the capital immediately?"</p><p>It seemed like he was making things up on the spot, but his furrowed brow betrayed a hint of worry. Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and asked, "Why do you want to leave the capital so urgently?"</p><p>"What are you afraid of?"</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't explain the rest of the plot to him and could only nervously say, "The Emperor is ill."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Huh? So what if he's ill?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... We've offended many people. Shouldn't we flee now?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, gently pinched Jiang Juan's cheek, and lazily said, "You worry about things that don't matter while neglecting those that do."</p><p>"Even if the Heavenly Father is ill, or even if the sky collapses, I will take the blame for you. What do you have to fear?"</p><p>Jiang Juan's face twisted into a ball. She looked at Xue Fangli but was not reassured, still feeling very worried.</p><p>The Prince refused to leave. What should she do?</p><p>Should she... just slip away herself?</p><p>Ah, that wouldn't do.</p><p>She had to think of a way to persuade the Prince to leave as well.</p><p>With an impossibly heavy heart, Jiang Juan fell into deep thought, but Xue Fangli kept watching her silently.</p><p>To offend many people, and flee quickly.</p><p>Flee from what?</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered silently.</p><p>Until today, he finally understood what the other person was always worried about. No wonder he had never let anyone treat him unfairly; the other person was always terribly afraid.</p><p>Afraid of offending those people.</p><p>Afraid that Emperor Hongxing would be harmed, and they would have no one to rely on, becoming victims of treachery.</p><p>Adorably foolish.</p><p>"I am your true pillar."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled. "Even if you offend many more people, what can they do? As long as I'm here, even if they hate you deeply, they will bow respectfully before you whenever they see you."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Jiang Juan still looked worried, biting her lip. She didn't say what was really on her mind. Seeing her like this, Xue Fangli's expression showed some concern.</p><p>She had to think of a way to completely ease the emperor's worries.</p><p>There was nothing to worry about; there was nothing worth worrying about at all.</p><p>In no time, Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli rushed to the Yangxin Palace.</p><p>They arrived late; there were already many people outside the palace.</p><p>The eldest prince, Xue Chaohua, knelt on the ground, crying and wailing, "Father! Father! Please don't have anything happen to you, Father——!"</p><p>His tears seemed genuine, but Jiang Juan couldn't help asking Xue Fangli softly, "Didn't the emperor just faint? Why does he seem to be crying so badly?"</p><p>She originally wanted to say "crying bitterly," but Jiang Juan felt it wasn't appropriate and changed her words. Xue Fangli teased lightly, "Afraid that if you cry too softly, the emperor won't hear your earnest heart."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke in a low voice, but Xue Fangli didn't deliberately lower his own. Seeing this, Xue Chaohua felt embarrassed and could only reluctantly shut up, cursing inwardly.</p><p>Every time they encountered these two, there was no good news.</p><p>They had too much nonsense to say.</p><p>With a creak, the door of the Yangxin Palace opened, and Director Wang walked out, saying with great relief, "The emperor has awakened, Your Highnesses, there is no major problem, so you ladies and princes need not worry."</p><p>No sooner had he finished speaking than singing could be heard outside the palace.</p><p>"Her Majesty the Empress Dowager has arrived——!"</p><p>"Royal Son, my Royal Son!"</p><p>The palace attendant supported the Empress Dowager as she hurried in. The Empress Dowager was unlike the concubines and princes; they had to wait for an invitation if they were concerned about Emperor Hongxing, but not the Empress Dowager.</p><p>Just as she was about to walk straight in, Governor Wang hesitated and said, "Your Excellency, the Emperor has instructed that if you come, you should rest. After all, it is quite late, and there is no need for concern."</p><p>The Empress Dowager was taken aback and asked sorrowfully, "Royal Son, are you still unwilling to see me?"</p><p>There was no response. The Emperor's intentions were clear enough; Governor Wang smiled and tried to console her, "Your Excellency, do not overthink it. The Emperor is just feeling unwell and fears that he might give you his illness. You..."</p><p>"It's my fault," the Empress Dowager said, "You've put me in this situation. I bore and raised you, only for a woman to cause such resentment towards me!"</p><p>"Wang—cough cough."</p><p>Inside the hall, Emperor Hongxing finally spoke. Governor Wang apologized with a smile and hurried inside.</p><p>A moment later, Governor Wang came out again. The Empress Dowager looked at him eagerly, but he turned to Xue Fangli and said, "Your Highness, the Emperor wishes to see you."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and looked at Jiang Juan, signaling her not to run away. Jiang Juan nodded, and Xue Fangli then left.</p><p>With a creak, the door of Yangxin Hall closed again. The Empress Dowager looked gloomily for a long time before finally hating him deep in her heart, gritting her teeth, "Royal Son, you prefer seeing this bastard over me."</p><p>"Bringing bad luck, if I had not lived, it would have been better. Truly, a bringer of bad luck!"</p><p>The Empress Dowager's voice was mournful as she swayed slightly. Mei Fei rushed forward to support her. The Empress Dowager's eyes were filled with tears as she said, "Everything I did was for the Royal Son, only for the Royal Son. How can you resent me?"</p><p>Mei Fei consoled her along those lines, "Your Excellency, do not be angry; the Emperor will come to his senses eventually."</p><p>The Empress Dowager shook her head, still gritting her teeth and saying, "This bringer of bad luck killed my mother, and now he is coming for my Royal Son too. Why does it have to be like this—"</p><p>"a persistent ghost?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was once detained by the Empress Dowager and knew that her nemesis was Wang Ye, the Prince. She had a rough idea of what the Empress Dowager had done.</p><p>— The fire in Chun Shen Hall seemed to be related to the Empress Dowager, and later she used the pretext of resolving astrological conflicts to associate Wang Ye's body with Yu Mei’s corpse.</p><p>Was this for Emperor Hong Xing?</p><p>Jiang Juan did not think so.</p><p>But that was not important. What mattered was that Emperor Hong Xing did not see her, while the Empress Dowager continued to blame Wang Ye without reason. Originally, Jiang Juan had been panicking about offending too many people during her journey to the palace, but she eventually found it pointless.</p><p>After all, she had already offended many people, and the Empress Dowager was no exception. Offending one more person would not make a difference.</p><p>"Empress Dowager..."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "You believe in Buddhism, which has three karmic actions—body, speech, and mind. Insulting Wang Ye is committing verbal karma, evil speech, which might lead to the Three Evil Paths."</p><p>The Three Evil Paths refer to hell, and the Empress Dowager's face turned red with anger. "What are you saying?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pretended not to understand and repeated her words word for word. The Empress Dowager asked coldly, "Are you cursing this humble one to go to hell after death?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said seriously, "It is not a curse. Since you believe in Buddhism, I am merely reminding you not to commit verbal karma, which is very serious."</p><p>"You—!"</p><p>Then Jiang Juan remembered something and asked her, "Empress Dowager, you say Yu Mei was killed by Wang Ye. Do you have evidence? If so, it's fine; if not, that would be slander, one form of verbal karma."</p><p>The Empress Dowager laughed sarcastically in anger, "Such a slanderous word, you know quite a bit."</p><p>"Empress Dowager, please don't take it to heart," said Mei Fei with a smile. "Madame Wang does indeed know a lot. You mentioned how Jing Ning Palace is quiet, but last time I saw an earless cat and wanted to bring it to you. Madame Wang said that since you believe in Buddhism, you cannot keep pets as they easily create evil karma. In the end, she took it back to raise herself."</p><p>She seemed to be advising the Empress Dowager, but in fact, she had ulterior motives. What she said sounded like Jiang Juan wanted to keep the earless cat and thus used the belief that one should not keep pets when believing in Buddhism as an excuse.</p><p>Indeed, the Empress Dowager's face darkened further.</p><p>Seeing this, Mei Fei's lips curled into a light smile.</p><p>The pendant always made Mei Fei think of her hate so strongly that she would grind her teeth in anger. That Xue Fangli had truly acted too shamelessly, forcefully taking it from her and giving it to some brute. Today, this Wangfei had walked right into the trap, and Mei Fei was determined to make good use of the situation.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Mei Fei then said to Jiang Juan, "You there, why did you dare to rebuke Empress Dowager? Quickly apologize to her; after all, she is your senior, how could you dare to speak back to her?"</p><p>Mei Fei seemed to be mediating, but in reality, she was deliberately stirring up trouble.</p><p>With these words, the Empress Dowager finally realized the absurdity of Jiang Juan's behavior. How could she be blamed for rebuking Empress Dowager? The Empress Dowager gave a cold snort, "Truly without manners, why are you not apologizing to this old woman yet?"</p><p>What does she have to apologize for, asked Mei Fei inwardly? After all, the Empress Dowager had spoken so much ill of the Prince, and hadn't apologized to him. Jiang Juan said in a sullen tone, "But Your Majesty, I was only afraid that you might forget the taboos of Buddhism, and reminded you out of good intentions. Why should I have to apologize?"</p><p>The Empress Dowager asked, "According to what you say, this old woman should thank you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment before replying, "That's unnecessary, I was just mentioning it casually as entertainment."</p><p>The Empress Dowager had intended to mock her, but Jiang Juan climbed up the ladder of flattery and made the Empress Dowager choke on her words. She said gloomily, "Last time I saw you, I didn't think you were so articulate."</p><p>Was this a compliment? Jiang Juan replied modestly, "Well enough, not very articulate at all."</p><p>The Empress Dowager was truly enraged and laughed sarcastically. She stared at Jiang Juan for several moments, not wanting to provoke that mad dog—Xue Fangli. The barefooted weren't afraid of those wearing shoes; last time she had only made Jiang Juan copy a few pages of scriptures, her Cining Palace nearly fell upside down.</p><p>However, the Empress Dowager couldn't stand it any longer and gritted her teeth. She roared angrily, "It's fine if you grew up in the countryside, but why are you so lacking in decorum!"</p><p>Saying that, she walked towards Jiang Juan and raised her hand to strike her—</p><p>"Empress Dowager!"</p><p>A figure flashed past, blocking Jiang Juan. The Empress Dowager's slap was deflected by another person—Jiang Sen Tao, who also seemed to be pulling Jiang Juan back. Turning around, she saw Su Feiyue rushing over.</p><p>As for the person in front, Jiang Juan was unfamiliar with him, but soon she found out who he was. </p><p>This man bowed and said, "Gu Yunzhi has seen Empress Dowager." </p><p>Jiang Sen Tao and Su Feiyue bowed to Empress Dowager, took a step forward, and silently protected Jiang Juan behind them. Empress Dowager frowned and said, "You all…" </p><p>Gu Yunzhi? </p><p>Was he Gu Puwang's father, Minister Gu? </p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him. Gu Yunzhi seemed to be observing something, slightly tilting his head as if misunderstanding something, giving Jiang Juan a comforting look. </p><p>"Why is Empress Dowager so upset with this young man?" </p><p>Gu Yunzhi smiled faintly, "It's not that serious." </p><p>Su Feiyue nodded and said, "If you quarrel with him and even fight, in the end, you'll be the one getting angry. Empress Dowager must take care of herself." </p><p>Jiang Sen Tao was fine; he had a special status and some connection to Xue Fangli, so it wasn't surprising for him to intervene. Gu Yunzhi and Su Feiyue were looking at Jiang Juan, making Empress Dowager puzzled. </p><p>She looked at them for a few moments, then smiled and said, "I will take care of myself. But since he has repeatedly offended me, I think I should teach him the rules in the palace." </p><p>"Ah, so that's why," Gu Yunzhi nodded. "I was thinking that Empress Dowager is always fair-minded and wouldn't punish young people for no reason; she's not petty at all." </p><p>After a pause, Gu Yunzhi added, "Young people are lively, but their liveliness can lead to them speaking without reserve. It's just an accidental mistake and doesn't count as an offense. Empress Dowager should not take it to heart." </p><p>Gu Yunzhi explained that it was an accident instead of an offense, which then became a mere slip of the tongue. </p><p>Since it was an accidental mistake, if Empress Dowager insisted on teaching him palace rules, she would seem petty indeed. </p><p>Dazzled by Gu's flattery, Empress Dowager did not insist further. After all, Gu Yunzhi was a key minister to Emperor Hongxing, and Empress Dowager naturally had to give him some face. Even if she was full of dissatisfaction in her heart—being told that gossiping would lead to hell, she could only smile and say, "Minister Gu is right; being lively is good for young people."</p><p>As for the person standing before her, Jiang Juan was initially unfamiliar with him, but she soon discovered his identity.</p><p>This man bowed and said, “Gu Yunzhi has seen Empress Dowager.”</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao and Su Feiyue bowed to Empress Dowager, took a step forward, and silently positioned themselves between her and Jiang Juan. Empress Dowager frowned and asked, "What is going on…?"</p><p>Was this Gu Yunzhi? </p><p>Could he be Minister Gu, father of Gu Puwang?</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him. Gu Yunzhi seemed to be observing something, slightly tilting his head as if misunderstanding something, giving Jiang Juan a comforting look.</p><p>"Why is Empress Dowager so upset with this young man?" she asked.</p><p>Gu Yunzhi smiled faintly and replied, "It's not that serious."</p><p>Su Feiyue nodded in agreement and said, "If you quarrel with him and even fight, it will only end up making you angry. Empress Dowager must take care of herself."</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao’s actions were understandable given his special status and connection to Xue Fangli, so there was no surprise in that. However, Gu Yunzhi and Su Feiyue's focus on Jiang Juan left Empress Dowager puzzled.</p><p>She glanced at them for a moment, then smiled and said, "I will take care of myself. But since he has repeatedly offended me, I think it’s appropriate to teach him the rules in the palace."</p><p>"Ah, so that's why," Gu Yunzhi nodded thoughtfully. "Empress Dowager is always fair-minded and wouldn't punish young people for no reason; she is not petty at all."</p><p>After a brief pause, Gu Yunzhi added, "Young people are lively, but their liveliness can sometimes lead to them speaking without thinking. It’s just an accidental mistake and doesn’t count as an offense. Empress Dowager should not take it to heart."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi's words shifted the blame from an intentional offense to an accidental mistake, which then became a mere slip of the tongue.</p><p>Since it was an accidental mistake, insisting on teaching him palace rules would make Empress Dowager seem petty indeed. Dazzled by Gu’s flattery, she did not insist further. After all, Gu Yunzhi was a key minister to Emperor Hongxing, and Empress Dowager naturally had to give him some face.

Even if she was full of dissatisfaction in her heart—being reminded that gossiping would lead to hell—she could only smile and say, "Minister Gu is right; being lively is good for young people."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi smiled, "Very well."</p><p>Gu Yunzhi clearly intended to protect Jiang Juan. The Empress Dowager did not want to reject his face-saving gesture and thus resolved to make a big issue small and a minor one even smaller. She was unhappy in her heart, while Mei Fei felt even more unwilling, yet she could do nothing but bite her lips in secret resentment.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing did not see her, so the Empress Dowager gazed at Yangxin Palace for several moments before finally sighing deeply and waving to a palace maid. She then walked away with a wobbly gait.</p><p>After she had gone far, Jiang Sen Tao asked Jiang Juan, "Are you alright?"</p><p>Su Feiyue and Gu Yunzhi looked over worriedly. Jiang Juan shook her head, "I'm fine."</p><p>However, she was somewhat puzzled in her heart. General Jiang and Suo Ma were saved by her grandfather, so their concern was understandable, but why was Chancellor Gu concerned?</p><p>Thinking about it for a moment, Jiang Juan directly asked, "Chancellor Gu, did my grandfather... save you?"</p><p>Gu Yunzhi was taken aback before he smiled and said, "Not at all."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "Oh," feeling even more puzzled. Then, in the next second, Gu Yunzhi added, "But he did save Pu Wang."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>This grandfather of hers is truly a peculiar fellow.</p><p>Loving to save people might be one thing, but his saving was too precise—either Suo Ma or General Jiang, or even the son of the Chancellor.</p><p>Jiang Juan was speechless with frustration.</p><p>In this era, there were no entertainment facilities, so Jiang Juan was used to going to bed early and getting up late. She rubbed her eyes a few times before the door of Yangxin Palace finally opened, allowing Xue Fangli to walk out.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Your Highness..."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked a few times, but his eyebrows frowned. His eyes turned red at the corners, and water vapor filled his eyes as if he had been bullied, but he didn’t say anything and only said, "Father wants to see you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was surprised and said, "Ah? See me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan took a few steps forward. When the Wang Ye didn’t follow him, she asked again, "Wang Ye, aren’t you coming with me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "Go first."</p><p>Jiang Juan had no choice but to walk into the Yangxin Palace on her own. Emperor Hongxing was leaning against the dragon bed. Upon seeing her, he smiled and said, "Here you are."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing said, "Good child, do you remember that day in the hall when I promised to heavily reward Fangli?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "Which day?"</p><p>After asking Jiang Juan, he remembered. There had been someone committing murder at a bookstore, and the Wang Ye reported it to the authorities, but was framed. Jiang Juan spoke up for him—without the Wang Ye reporting it out of kindness, the authorities wouldn’t have arrived so quickly, perhaps leading to a great disaster. He shouldn’t have been punished; he should have been heavily rewarded, which Emperor Hongxing had promised.</p><p>Seeing Fangli’s expression suddenly enlightened, Emperor Hongxing coughed lightly, "Remembered?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Mm."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing said pensively, "Later, I thought to myself, Fangli, no matter what it is, whatever I reward you with, you probably wouldn’t like it. Why not reward you instead? But I couldn’t decide what to give you for a long time. Today, however, I have an idea."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "What?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled slightly and said, "Reward you as the Crown Princess."</p><p>At the same time, Xue Fangli walked step by step towards Concubine Mei with a voice cold to the extreme, "Concubine Mei, this Wang’s concubine seems to have cried. This Wang wants to ask what exactly happened."</p>
