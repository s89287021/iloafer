						<p>Early in the morning, he started from being a human-shaped pillow.</p><p>As soon as they got into the carriage, Jiang Juan was pulled over.</p><p>He didn’t eat breakfast, although there were plenty of snacks in the carriage. Jiang Juan looked down and eventually gave up, leaning against Xue Fangli saltily.</p><p>Xue Fangli noticed this, took a piece of peach cake to feed him, but Jiang Juan shook his head, “I won’t eat.”</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"I can't fall asleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still drowsy; if he settled in the right position, he could fall asleep immediately. If it were any later and he was fully awake, he would be disoriented all day after waking up early.</p><p>Xue Fangli said “Mm,” put down the peach cake, and cleaned his hands leisurely. Jiang Juan curiously asked, "Your Highness, why don’t you eat?"</p><p>It wasn't the first time this had happened. The Prince only enjoyed feeding him; if Jiang Juan didn’t eat, he would have someone take it away but barely touched it himself.</p><p>"I won’t eat."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>The Prince was so sick that he needed to eat well, Jiang Juan tactfully asked him, "Your Highness, are you an immortal fairy?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Immortal fairies only drink dew; you seem to like drinking dew quite a bit too."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows slightly. The hand on Jiang Juan’s waist pulled him closer. He lowered his head and almost whispered in Jiang Juan’s ear lazily.</p><p>"You are, this prince is not."</p><p>The next moment, a touch landed on Jiang Juan's shoulder. Xue Fangli rested his chin against Jiang Juan's shoulder and said listlessly, "Go to sleep."</p><p>With that, he closed his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Why did he turn into a human support again?</p><p>Why was there always new business every day?</p><p>Running the business was tough. Jiang Juan sighed; he had intended to go to sleep but suddenly noticed something and glanced at it several times more.</p><p>The Prince's eyelashes were rather long.</p><p>Staring at them, Jiang Juan couldn't help reaching out to touch, only to be startled back to his senses when he made contact. His hand was held, and Xue Fangli opened his eyes, simply asking, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Caught red-handed, Jiang Juan could only speak the truth. "Your Highness, your eyelashes are very long."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Not sleeping then?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...sleeping."</p><p>As soon as he said it, Jiang Juan's eyes were covered, and Xue Fangli sat up, pressing him into his arms.</p><p>"Why do you touch everything you see?"</p><p>Not knowing what had been touched, Xue Fangli let out a breath. Jiang Juan blinked, suddenly feeling guilty—last time he had ridden in the carriage to the palace, the Prince had fallen asleep, and Jiang Juan found his lip color appealing and reached out to touch it.</p><p>As the eyelashes twitched, brushing softly over his palm, Xue Fangli paused for a moment before saying absentmindedly, "Your eyelashes are even longer."</p><p>They were also very soft. Like feathers, moving slightly could send tingles straight to the heart.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked a few times, and the gentle sensation returned. Xue Fangli tightened his grip on Jiang Juan's eyes, "Moved."</p><p>"Ah," Jiang Juan said, quickly closing his eyes, thinking that Xue Fangli wanted him to sleep.</p><p>He was almost completely restrained in his embrace, unable to see anything; even his one good hand was being held. Jiang Juan lay still and obediently next to Xue Fangli.</p><p>So good, too good.</p><p>The calming breaths filled the space between them, Xue Fangli looked down at Jiang Juan. That moment of silence was something he enjoyed. He slightly raised the corners of his mouth and closed his eyes again.</p><p>Waking up early made Jiang Juan feel disoriented, and Senior Manager Gao also seemed unsteady on his feet. He had just come out from Hongxiu Pavilion, where his eyes were barely open before being forced to work. There was no need to enter the palace so early; the Emperor might not even be awake yet.</p><p>Upon arriving at the palace, Senior Manager Gao lifted the curtain. Although he was not surprised that Jiang Juan was napping, Xue Fangli was also resting, which left him speechless and choked with emotion.</p><p>Senior Manager Gao: "......"</p><p>So, what was the point of coming so early?</p><p>Senior Manager Gao's movements were minimal, yet even the slightest sound disturbed Xue Fangli. He lifted his eyelids in displeasure, and Senior Manager Gao was startled, hurriedly apologizing, "Your Highness——"</p><p>Jiang Juan stirred slightly, and Xue Fangli raised his hand to gently massage Jiang Juan's nape.</p><p>His movements were gentle enough, but the cold stare he shot at Senior Manager Gao was terrifying. Seeing this, Senior Manager Gao immediately shut up and lowered the curtain nervously.</p><p>"Oh, the Lady is still sleeping."</p><p>Despite Xue Fangli's silence, as the high-risk manager of Prince Wang's residence, Senior Manager Gao knew what to do. He instructed the driver, "Turn around and continue forward."</p><p>Jiang Juan slept until he was fully rested, opening his eyes just before noon.</p><p>"I only intended to take a short nap."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt very puzzled, wondering how he had slept for so long. He asked Xue Fangli, "Your Majesty, why didn't you wake me up?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke softly, "I was about to wake you up, but since you were accompanying this king into the palace, I thought it better for you to get a good rest first."</p><p>"Actually, there was no need to..."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit embarrassed, but he was still deeply moved. "Your Majesty, you are truly kind."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "Why not?"</p><p>Gao Guanshi: "... "</p><p>How should I put this?</p><p>The king shouldn't wake up earlier than the queen consort by so much.</p><p>While the queen consort was taking a nap, the king had been resting with her for the entire morning.</p><p>Gao Guanshi looked at Jiang Juan with a complicated expression and sighed inwardly.</p><p>Ah, our king, his heart is truly filthy; he only knows how to deceive the innocent queen consort.</p><p>No matter how much Gao Guanshi lamented, Jiang Juan, the deceived party, was unaware. He got off the carriage and was invited along with Xue Fangli into the Yangxin Pavilion together.</p><p>"Your Majesty—!"</p><p>"When my son left home, he was still a graceful young man. When this subject saw him again in the evening, he was covered in blood and his hair was disheveled. This subject knew that my unruly son had committed great wrongs and could not be forgiven, but if it were not for Your Majesty, how would he have ended up like this?"</p><p>As soon as they entered, they saw someone beating their chest and stomping their feet. Li Shilang knelt on the ground, almost sobbing with every word, while Hongxing Emperor only rubbed his temples wearily and lifted his head to look at them.</p><p>"He has arrived."</p><p>Emperor Xing smiled, he raised his chin, "Everyone, please sit down."</p><p>After a pause, Emperor Xing said in a calm tone, "Shilang Li, you may also take your seat."</p><p>"Your Majesty, this subject——"</p><p>Shilang Li was kneeling on the ground and was about to speak when Emperor Xing interrupted him, "Since I have promised to advocate for you, I will provide you with a resolution."</p><p>Advocate?</p><p>The Prince had been blackmailed.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and looked at Xue Fangli with sympathy. Xue Fangli glanced over at him, "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered to him, "Your Majesty said he would advocate for you, does that mean he is really going to punish you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli always acted in a reckless and unorganized manner, and there were many people who had entered the palace to lodge complaints against him. He never took them seriously, this time was no exception. Xue Fangli smiled and said, "It should not happen."</p><p>Should not?</p><p>This wasn't a certainty, which meant that it could very well happen. Jiang Juan frowned, more worried than ever before. He said to Xue Fangli, "Prince, you need to explain things clearly to Your Majesty."</p><p>He furrowed his brow, his worry almost spilling out. Xue Fangli had merely mentioned this offhandedly and did not expect Jiang Juan to be so concerned. He was taken aback for a moment, then slowly smiled, "What's the problem?"</p><p>"There is a problem."</p><p>Jiang Juan was terrified that he would be blamed. He was even more anxious than Xue Fangli himself. "Prince, you can't just leave it like this, let them say bad things about you without explanation."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, and the youth's eyes were filled with only him; his worry and anxiety included him as well.</p><p>Jiang Juan's focus on him was something Xue Fangli always enjoyed. He could have told Jiang Juan that there really was no problem, but he greedily wanted to savor a few more moments of attention and did not reveal anything.</p><p>Emperor Xing smiled and raised his chin, "Everyone, please sit down."</p><p>After a pause, he said calmly, "Shilang Li, you may also take your seat."</p><p>"Your Majesty, this subject——"</p><p>Shilang Li was kneeling on the ground when Emperor Xing interrupted him, saying, "Since I have promised to advocate for you, I will provide you with a resolution."</p><p>Advocate?</p><p>The Prince had been blackmailed.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and looked at Xue Fangli sympathetically. Xue Fangli glanced over at him and asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered, "Your Majesty said he would advocate for you—does that mean he will punish you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli always acted recklessly and lacked organization; many people had entered the palace to lodge complaints against him, but he never took them seriously. This time was no exception. Xue Fangli smiled and replied, "It should not happen."</p><p>Should not?</p><p>This wasn't a certainty, which meant it could very well happen. Jiang Juan frowned, more worried than ever before. He said to Xue Fangli, "Prince, you need to explain things clearly to Your Majesty."</p><p>He furrowed his brow, his worry almost spilling out. Xue Fangli had mentioned this offhandedly and did not expect Jiang Juan to be so concerned. He was taken aback for a moment, then slowly smiled, "What's the problem?"</p><p>"There is one."</p><p>Jiang Juan was terrified that he would be blamed. He was even more anxious than Xue Fangli himself. "Prince, you can't just leave it like this—let them say bad things about you without explanation."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him; his eyes were filled with only Jiang Juan, and even his worry and anxiety seemed to include Jiang Juan.</p><p>Emperor Xing smiled gently and raised his chin. "Everyone, please take your seats."</p><p>After a brief pause, he said calmly, "Shilang Li, you may also sit down."</p><p>"Your Majesty, this subject——"</p><p>Before Shilang Li could speak further, Emperor Xing interrupted him, "Since I have promised to advocate for you, I will provide you with a resolution."</p><p>Advocate?</p><p>The Prince had been implicated in some manner.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed deeply and looked at Xue Fangli with sympathy. Xue Fangli glanced over, his expression slightly puzzled. "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered softly, "Your Majesty said he would advocate for you—does that mean he will punish you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli was known for his reckless and disorganized behavior; many had come to the palace to file complaints against him, but he had never taken them seriously. This time was no different. Xue Fangli smiled slightly, saying, "It should not happen."</p><p>Should not?</p><p>This was not a certainty, which meant it could still very well occur. Jiang Juan frowned, his worry increasing. He turned to Xue Fangli and said earnestly, "Prince, you need to explain things clearly to Your Majesty."</p><p>He furrowed his brow, his concern almost palpable. Xue Fangli had mentioned this offhandedly, not realizing how worried Jiang Juan was. Taken aback for a moment, he slowly smiled and asked, "What's the problem?"</p><p>"There is one."</p><p>Jiang Juan was terrified that he would be blamed. He felt even more anxious than Xue Fangli himself. "Prince, you can't just leave it like this—let them say bad things about you without explanation."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him; his eyes were filled with nothing but Jiang Juan, and even his worry seemed to include him.</p><p>"...Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan called out again, but Xue Fangli only looked down at him without any hint of resentment. Jiang Juan watched him in confusion.</p><p>Why won't Your Highness explain anything?</p><p>Clearly, Your Highness didn't do anything wrong.</p><p>The more Jiang Juan loved Your Highness, the more annoyed he became now. He slowly released his grip and sat down with his head lowered.</p><p>He was a bit angry.</p><p>Jiang Juan rarely got angry; he had a good nature, and with his fragile heart, he couldn't bear such strong negative emotions.</p><p>But soon, Jiang Juan lost control of himself. He too had been misunderstood before and knew how painful it felt to be blamed unjustly. Why didn't Your Highness show any reaction? Not even an explanation.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his eyelashes, unusually calm. Xue Fangli noticed this and reached out to wrap his waist, but Jiang Juan gently pushed him away.</p><p>"Your Majesty..."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned as Jiang Juan softly replied.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing looked at him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Your Highness refused to say anything. No matter how angry Jiang Juan was, he couldn't help but explain for him, "Yesterday in the bookstore, Your Highness kindly reported a crime. It seemed like you were trying to do something about it."</p><p>"Was what Your Highness did right? Someone committed murder in the bookstore, and by reporting it and stopping them, disaster could have been prevented. Are you planning to make a decision—rewarding Your Highness?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing finished speaking, then paused.</p><p>Jiang Juan's words were clearly protective, but—</p><p>His dictation was always perfunctory, consisting of merely a few lukewarm statements. Emperor Xinghong had never intended to do anything differently in the past, and this case was no exception either. Shilang Li could not rise from his prostrate position, fully aware of how excessively indulgent the emperor was toward Xue Fangli.</p><p>Jiang Juan's expression was serious. He looked at Emperor Xinghong, then at Xue Fangli, and suddenly realized something important.</p><p>Wang Wu's concubine was quite close to Wang Wu; she neither feared him nor hesitated to defend him.</p><p>Entering the palace, Emperor Xinghong felt profoundly relieved. Originally, he had intended to grant Shushan Li a bit of face, but now he changed his mind. He nodded repeatedly and said, "You are right. Wang Wu has done a good job by reporting the incident; there will be a reward for him—double rewards!"</p><p>Shilang Li was taken aback. From yesterday until today, he had been kneeling not to witness Emperor Xinghong rewarding Prince Liang, but his tears flowed freely as he said, "Your Majesty, all my faults and sins lie on my wayward son. But is the Young Master guiltless?"</p><p>Jiang Juan found this strange and could not help asking him, "If the Young Master is not guilty, does that mean he forced your son to commit the crime with his own hands?"</p><p>Shilang Li was caught off guard by Jiang Juan's question and replied solemnly, "In response to Your Majesty, the Young Master did not."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked in confusion, "Then why would the Young Master be guilty?"</p><p>"Or did the Young Master use some kind of mind-altering technique to make your son lose his sanity, leading him to commit murder at the bookshop?"</p><p>Shilang Li: "... "</p><p>Stumped by Jiang Juan's question, Shilang Li could not speak for a long time. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, "Your Majesty may not know, but on that day, it was the Young Master's threat to cut off my son's tongue that made him lose control of his emotions and act irrationally, resulting in such a tragic outcome."</p><p>Jiang Juan finished listening and found this rather peculiar. He paused for a moment, walked up to Shilang Li, and slapped him lightly but clearly on the face.</p><p>Shilang Li was momentarily stunned before realizing what had happened. His face turned red as he said, "Your Majesty, what have I done wrong that you would humiliate me like this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "You were spreading lies, provoking my anger, and in a fit of rage, I lost my composure and slapped you. You should reflect on your actions."</p><p>Shilang Li: "??"</p><p>Jiang Juan articulated his thoughts for him, "Isn't it quite reasonable, isn't it?"</p><p>"I shouldn't have hit you, or rather, you shouldn't blame the Prince on yourself," Jiang Juan explained her reasoning and then apologized, "I'm sorry. I was afraid I couldn't explain it clearly, so I resorted to hitting you."</p><p>Sir Li: "..."</p><p>He didn't know what to say, feeling stifled yet unable to speak, for after all, Jiang Juan had used his own argument to block him.</p><p>Emperor Xinghong watched in disbelief and, after a moment, burst into silent laughter.</p><p>After finishing his action, Jiang Juan sat back down. Xue Fangli smiled and grabbed his hand, intending to ask if he was hurt, but before she could finish, Jiang Juan had already pulled back, unwilling to look at her, still sulking.</p><p>Though angry, this did not prevent Jiang Juan from protecting the Prince. After a pause, he said to Sir Li again, "The Prince has such a good temper that he wouldn't easily cut off someone's tongue unless your young master said something he shouldn't have."</p><p>"You should look for the reason within your young master himself, not take out your anger on the Prince and report him to the palace."</p><p>Sir Li: "?"</p><p>He stared at Jiang Juan in shock, all his rage forgotten.</p><p>The Prince has such a good temper?</p><p>Li's prince is so good-tempered??</p><p>Sir Li was bewildered.</p><p>Not only Sir Li, even Emperor Xinghong was extremely surprised. As the emperor, he could only ball his hand into a fist and press it to his mouth, pretending to cough several times to hide his embarrassment.</p><p>A good temper?</p><p>Elder Brother Wu has such a good temper?</p><p>Did he give that concubine of his a love potion???</p><p>Emperor Xingxing’s mood was complex. He glanced at Xue Fangli and found that his son’s evaluation of him remained unperturbed, no matter how he reacted. Therefore, despite the shock a father might feel, he had to forcibly calm himself. Emperor Xingxing smiled and nodded, saying, "Mm, yes, Old Five truly… is not bad."</p><p>"Another incident involved a woodcutter who returned home late at night but got lost. He asked Prince Wang for directions but was stripped of his skin alive by the prince."</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched. He had lowered his head as soon as he sat down, completely ignoring Xue Fangli.</p><p>At this moment, seeing Jiang Juan’s eyelashes flutter and his brow slowly crease, Xue Fangli’s expression darkened with suspicion.</p><p>What was the young man resisting?</p><p>Or rather, did he not truly believe him?</p><p>Infinite anger surged within him. His brutality and madness were eroding his rationality. Xue Fangli looked deeply into Jiang Juan’s eyes, changing his previously indifferent demeanor as he slowly lifted his head.</p><p>"Enough."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke with a detached tone. Emperor Xingxing knew his temper well; he seemed annoyed now. Although it seemed quite strange to him, Emperor Xingxing still intended to give him a good impression.</p><p>Emperor Xingxing said to Jiang Juan, "It is already noon. I saw that boy from the Jiang family earlier and invited him to have a meal with me. The table should be set by now. Since you have heart disease, you might as well join us, or else you’ll go hungry."</p><p>Jiang Juan has not eaten anything since this morning and is quite hungry, but he cannot leave the prince's side, so he is somewhat reluctant to go.</p><p>"Go," Schu Fangli said with a lowered gaze. "Who knows how much longer we will have to wait or how many more letters you need to read." </p><p>He spoke softly and slowly. No matter how angry he felt inside, he did not let it show in his tone, which was even gentle.</p><p>Jiang Juan was worried that Schu Fangli would be at a disadvantage if he didn't go, but now he was the one telling Jiang Juan to leave. Jiang Juan said "Oh" and seemed obedient, though there was also a hint of defiance.</p><p>Let him go then, as long as he had tried his best.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing gave a signal, and an eunuch immediately led the way. Jiang Juan walked away without turning back, while Schu Fangli watched him leave with a dark expression, his smile disappearing from his face.</p><p>"Mr. Li, do you know that this prince not only cut off your son's tongue but also intended to sew his mouth shut."</p><p>With Jiang Juan gone, Schu Fangli no longer needed to hide anything. His expression was shockingly cold, and his anger continued to seethe out. "Unfortunately, he stole a guard's knife and used it to attack others instead of himself, sparing this prince from dirtying his hands."</p><p>Schu Fangli sneered with an air of mockery. "He stole the knife, he cut down the people. Why blame this prince?"</p><p>"Mr. Li, what did he say to you yesterday?"</p><p>Schu Fangli raised his rosy lips. "How could I have known that when I said it, this prince would deliberately go against him but never mentioned how he mocked this prince's concubine."</p><p>"According to the laws of our dynasty, such disrespect should be punished by execution, Mr. Li."</p><p>Mr. Li moved his lips as if to speak but was immediately shocked upon hearing the rest.</p><p>Mocking the concubine, his rebellious son had indeed never mentioned it.</p><p>Schu Fangli smiled and said, "This prince initially did not care and merely ordered his tongue cut out and his mouth sewn shut. But now, thanks to Mr. Li, this prince's concubine is unhappy, so is this prince. Suddenly, I feel the urge to settle accounts with him again."</p><p>"Mr. Li, this prince was merely meting out a minor punishment, but you want your son's life."</p><p>Knowing that pleading with King Departure would be of no avail, Lord Li gritted his teeth and said to Emperor Xinghong, "Your Majesty, please spare the life of my rebellious son!"</p><p>"He did it unintentionally; he definitely did not intend to disrespect the Concubine!"</p><p>Emperor Xinghong looked at him without speaking. Lord Li wished he could bang his head on the ground. "I have served for over twenty years, always cautious and fearful of saying that I have worked hard and made significant contributions. Your Majesty's orders have never gone awry. Please spare my rebellious son's life out of our twenty-year bond as lord and vassal!"</p><p>"Otherwise—this subject shall crash his head into the pillar today and go with my rebellious son!"</p><p>Lord Li raised his hand, trembling slightly, pointing at the golden pillar in front of the hall. Xue Fangli saw this and curled up his lip corners, smiling like a demon, "Go ahead, Lord Li, hurry up."</p><p>"If you hit it, that's fine," Xue Fangli's voice was cold, "If not, this king can send you on your way."</p><p>Lord Li stared at him in bewilderment, feeling as if he looked like a demon, terrifying to behold.</p><p>"Lord Li, sons do not blame their fathers. Given our twenty-year bond as lord and vassal, I will not hold this matter against you too much, but laws cannot be violated. The law says that he should be executed, so execution shall take place. I grant you permission to see your son one last time. Do not cause further trouble."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong also waved his hand, "Go quickly."</p><p>It was all over, everything was over.</p><p>Lord Li's legs gave out, and he sat down on the hall floor, tears streaming down. He almost crawled out of the Palace of Tranquil Heart.</p><p>Once Lord Li's matter was settled, Jiang Juan was also brought to the dining place in a moment.</p><p>Before he could even enter, he heard a very familiar voice arguing with someone.</p><p>"What? It's not nourishing medicinal food, how can it only regulate qi and blood? What about my heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and stomach?"</p><p>"It should be effective as well? Have you had your heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and stomach regulated? Have it? Whatever you say is effective."</p><p>"Can it strengthen the body? Didn't you just say it can only nourish blood and qi? How can your words be so contradictory?"</p><p>Well, this is a one-sided argument.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>The boy from the Jiang family turned out to be Jiang Qingliang.</p><p>Why is he such an argumentative person?</p><p>Jiang Juan regretted coming over. He shouldn't have come.</p><p>However—</p><p>He was still somewhat angry with the Prince.</p><p>But he also felt a bit concerned about him.</p><p>Sigh, I wonder if anyone will bully the Prince after he leaves.</p>
