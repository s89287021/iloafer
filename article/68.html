						<p>Things have settled, and the screen of the elegant seating arrangement was also brought back.</p><p>"Prince, Princess, if there is nothing else, this servant will take my leave and not disturb you both."</p><p>The storyteller had managed to save his life just now, so he was being cautious. Seeing the situation, he wisely decided to leave, but unfortunately, Schue Fangli glanced at him with a faint voice, "Where are you going? This Prince still has questions for you."</p><p>He sighed inwardly and forced a smile, "Prince, feel free to ask."</p><p>"What about that story just now, where did you get it from?"</p><p>"In reply to Your Highness..."</p><p>Upon his inquiry, the storyteller naturally dared not hide anything, "A beggar told it to this servant."</p><p>"This servant makes a living as a storyteller, and those beggars roam all over the place, so they have seen and heard much. As long as I treat them to a feast, I can get a story in return."</p><p>Schue Fangli asked, "Do you still remember what that beggar looked like?"</p><p>The storyteller recalled for a moment and said with a bitter smile, "Prince, he was just a beggar, dirty and unkempt, this servant could not see his face clearly. However... He seemed to be around the same age as Your Highness."</p><p>Schue Fangli asked him again, "Where did you meet that beggar?"</p><p>The storyteller answered without hesitation, "Beside the old locust tree outside the city walls."</p><p>Schue Fangli nodded and looked at the guard, "Find him."</p><p>The guard replied, "Yes, Prince."</p><p>Since this was a deep palace secret, it naturally mattered greatly. The storyteller hurriedly said, "Prince, this is the first time this servant has told this story today, I will never tell it again, I dare not tell it again."</p><p>As he spoke, the storyteller bowed several times with a loud thud, but Schue Fangli did not respond.</p><p>Compared to promises, a dead person does not speak and is much more reliable.</p><p>But—</p><p>"Prince, you frightened him."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head to smell the clear wine in the pot. It took him quite some time before he could detect anything particular, and then he lifted his head. The Prince remained silent. Jiang Juan genuinely felt that it was just a scare, not something that was taken to heart.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and said, "Hm," finally speaking calmly to the storyteller, "Go."</p><p>The storyteller nodded in relief and bowed again before standing up.</p><p>Just as he turned around, the storyteller saw this Prince picking up his seated Princess Consort and holding a cup of wine to her lips, smiling gently and asking, "Having smelled it for so long, would you like to taste it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head and pushed his hand away. As he continued pushing, the storyteller moved away, feeling somewhat embarrassed. Noticing his awkwardness, Xue Fangli did not even lift his eyes and replied coldly, "You don't want to leave?"</p><p>"I'll go."</p><p>The storyteller shivered, wishing his feet could move as fast as the wind. However, a daring thought surfaced in his mind.</p><p>The Prince truly loved Princess Consort just as rumors suggested.</p><p>Why not… change today's events and tell this story?</p><p>Only after the storyteller left did Jiang Juan feel better, though he still complained, "Prince, don't suddenly lift me up like that."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with a nonchalant "Hm," seeming to genuinely respond to whatever Jiang Juan said.</p><p>Jiang Juan came out, turning his head reluctantly to look at him. Xue Fangli met his gaze and suddenly asked, "The storyteller was telling such an interesting story; why did you not let him continue?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised a lip in a smile, "Madam is truly magnificent."</p><p>Jiang Juan suspected that he was mocking him, but there !!(EXTRA string=was) no evidence, "It's none of your business."</p><p>Xue Fangli slowly said, "Don't you ask His Majesty?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. He had indeed thought about asking, after all, the Wangye's words were not happy memories. Jiang Juan honestly replied, "I don't want to know."</p><p>"Do you want to know why he didn't make it out?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked this question from head to toe, and Jiang Juan finally reacted.</p><p>The "he" in Wangye's words was likely someone who said they would take Youmeini away but never made it out.</p><p>"Your Majesty, I don't..."</p><p>"He was shot to death by arrows."</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to stop him, but he was forced to see the answer. His eyelashes twitched, and after a long while, he merely said "Oh," with no further reaction.</p><p>Xue Fangli examined him curiously for a moment before slowly speaking again, as if testing or luring.</p><p>"Can't you pity him?"</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli changed his wording, "Am I... the cursed offspring who should die?"</p><p>His fingers touched the wine bottle, gripping it tightly. Jiang Juan lifted the wine bottle and shook it several times, listening to the swishing sound of the wine sloshing as he spoke.</p><p>According to the story of the storyteller—Wangye saw the letter, Youmeini begged him not to tell the emperor, but in the end, she did not wait for her husband. That means...</p><p>Wangye kept her secret safe, Youmeini's hopes were dashed, and her husband was shot to death by arrows.</p><p>This person is pitiable; how can one not pity them?</p><p>His wife was abducted by the emperor, and he himself lost his life.</p><p>However.</p><p>However.</p><p>Jiang Juan understood the reasoning, he could not blame the Prince.</p><p>Not only could he not blame the Prince, but he could also find numerous excuses for him.</p><p>Yu Meiniu treated him badly; Yu Meiniu had been tormenting the Prince all along.</p><p>But no matter what, if that were true, then it would mean the Prince had done something wrong.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He still had many reasons to justify the Prince.</p><p>This was not right.</p><p>Yet he was favoring the Prince.</p><p>"You shouldn't say such things about yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his eyelashes and softly spoke, "You are just... you are just..."</p><p>He wasn't good at comforting people, but somehow knew how to justify them. Jiang Juan muttered, "You must have never thought it would end up like this."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped moving for a moment, then he lowered his eyelashes and stared intently at Jiang Juan.</p><p>Nian was always kind-hearted, enjoying getting involved in others' affairs and helping those in distress. At this moment, upon hearing about the incident, Nian did not blame him or glare coldly at him; he was only clumsily trying to comfort him.</p><p>After looking for a long time, Xue Fangli suddenly pressed Jiang Juan into his embrace, holding him very tightly as if he wanted to blend Jiang Juan into his blood and bones.</p><p>"Yes, this king does not know."</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was low and hoarse.</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, his heart involuntarily tightening. He turned his head and gently hugged Xue Fangli, softly patting his back again and again, his brows slowly furrowing in worry.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, the faint fragrance of medicinal herbs lingering in his nostrils. He enjoyed the comfort from the person in his arms and felt the warmth, his expression filled with joy.</p><p>"It was a lie."</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Xue Fangli raised his crimson lips and smiled maliciously, "Little Bodhisattva, do you know that you have succumbed to worldly desires?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>He lifted his head in shock. Xue Fangli smiled and said, "If it were really this king who killed him, you would never know about this matter."</p><p>"It was Father Emperor himself who did it; it has nothing to do with this king."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>The prince had been lying to him all along.</p><p>He had consoled the prince for so long.</p><p>He had even secretly blamed himself inwardly.</p><p>Why is the prince like this?</p><p>Jiang Juan was unhappy. He released his hand and immediately stopped hugging Xue Fangli, but after just one second, that hand was back on Xue Fangli's face. Jiang Juan gently pinched him and said sullenly, "Prince, why do you keep lying to me? Is lying so much fun?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze and spoke with a leisurely tone, "It's naturally fun."</p><p>Jiang Juan moped, "You're so annoying."</p><p>He was somewhat annoyed and pushed Xue Fangli away, refusing to sit in his arms. In response, Xue Fangli hugged him tightly, making it impossible for Jiang Juan to break free. He could only grumble, "Let go."</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him. Jiang Juan lowered his head on his own, tugging at his fingers. After a few more pulls, Xue Fangli spoke indifferently again.</p><p>"It wasn't this king who told the emperor, but Jiang Qingmei insisted that it was me who informed the emperor."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback.</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was as flat as if he were asking Jiang Juan whether he wanted to eat a pastry. He said calmly, "She originally hated this king. Learning of Qi Xiuran's death from arrows, her hatred intensified even more."</p><p>Jiang Juan exclaimed with an "ah" and frowned again.</p><p>He had just been annoyed at being tricked, but in the span of one sentence and a short while, Jiang Juan couldn't help softening his heart once more.</p><p>He really didn't have a good memory, nor did he think about whether the prince was tricking him again. He lifted his head with loving eyes and sighed softly.</p><p>"Prince, you..."</p><p>Though he had a poor memory, Jiang Juan remembered grudges. The prince had tricked him once, yet Yu Meiniang was the source of all the prince's misfortunes. Jiang Juan really wanted to comfort him, but after much thought, he slowly said, "Prince, I want to console you. Can I?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and looked at him, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't act immediately. He glanced at Xue Fangli with a wistful expression and said, "Then... apologize to me first."</p><p>"You've tricked me again. After you apologize, I'll console you once more."</p><p>Xue Fangli had merely intended to tease Jiang Juan and then coax him back, but he knew how soft-hearted the prince was. However, Jiang Juan's reaction piqued his interest. He nodded and said, "I'm sorry."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyebrows, his expression showing deep fatigue as if mentioning Yu Meiniang would drag him back into an endless cycle of pain and hatred.</p><p>Jiang Juan received his apology. He had always been apathetic and immediately ceased to argue with Xue Fangli. He hugged Xue Fangli again, wrapping around his neck like a small animal, rubbing against him, pressing his soft face against him in a clumsy but adorable manner.</p><p>More of a show of petulance than comfort.</p><p>After some time, Jiang Juan asked, "Your Highness, are you feeling better now?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Seems… somewhat."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked. He was not good at comforting and could only repeat a few set phrases. Not wanting the prince to be unhappy, he asked, "What can I do to make you happy?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at his pale lips and said nonchalantly, "Perhaps if His Highness kisses me…"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "No…"</p><p>Intending to refuse, but before he could finish speaking, seeing Xue Fangli’s eyelids droop slightly with a lackluster expression, Jiang Juan immediately closed his mouth. He remained silent for a while, hesitantly asking, "Can’t we change it? Is there something else that can make you happy?"</p><p>As he spoke, an idea struck him. "Or maybe…"</p><p>Back at the stables, the prince seemed particularly interested in the mole on Jiang Juan’s body. Preferring to be bitten rather than kissed, Jiang Juan uncertainly asked, "Your Highness, how about I bite you instead?"</p><p>To be bitten?</p><p>The corner of his lips lifted slightly and then disappeared without a trace as Xue Fangli gently stroked Jiang Juan’s face, indifferent: "You’re too afraid of pain."</p><p>Jiang Juan did fear pain, but with the prince in such a bad mood, still thinking of him, Jiang Juan wanted to cheer him up even more. After all, every time he had trouble, the prince would comfort him. He said, "I’m scared of pain; you can bite gently."</p><p>Saying this, Jiang Juan changed his sitting position, facing Xue Fangli and sitting in his lap. After a few seconds of hesitation, he reached out to grab the raven hair piled on his shoulder, leaned forward, and boldly said, "Your Highness, go ahead and bite."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him for a moment, his gaze lowering to rest on the red mole.</p><p>In 20’s neck area, the skin was a pristine white, except for this momentary red mole that was vividly bright, it was also the deepest hue on 20’s body.</p><p>The pale hand rose, fingers caressing the mole. Xue Fangli did not know what it reminded him of as he silently made a sound of appreciation.</p><p>Buddha cutting flesh to feed an eagle; his little Bodhisattva, this is sacrificing himself for him.</p><p>He could not have asked for anything better.</p><p>Fingers swept past, finally gripping 20’s round shoulder. Xue Fangli lowered his head, the fragrance of herbs filled his nostrils as he bit down.</p><p>Breath moistened.</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched, fingers unconsciously tightened and gripped Xue Fangli’s sleeve.</p><p>Lips moved, teeth lightly grinding past.</p><p>Oh, it really tickles.</p><p>Jiang Juan gasped softly, "M-Master Wang, is that enough?"</p><p>The teahouse was not entirely quiet. Their private room was also not completely isolated; the raised screen could block prying eyes but could not shield the noise outside.</p><p>People were coming and going outside the screen, voices clamorous, yet none knew what they were doing inside.</p><p>This was a teahouse, filled with people everywhere.</p><p>Realizing this, Jiang Juan wanted to push Xue Fangli away again. Seemingly sensing her intention, Xue Fangli used a bit of force, biting him as if in punishment.</p><p>"…Master Wang."</p><p>It did not hurt too much, but the neck area felt scalding hot, so intense that Jiang Juan lost his focus. He dazedly looked at Xue Fangli, complaining with a cat-like voice, "You said to bite once, you bit many times."</p><p>"You niu3."</p><p>His voice was soft like water, the more he pouted, the less Xiao Fangli wanted to let go. Moreover, due to embarrassment, his fair skin turned a light blush, beautiful and tempting.</p><p>"Prince Wang."</p><p>Jiang Juan called again, savoring that red mole repeatedly. Finally, Xiao Fangli had enough; he lifted his eyelids and asked Jiang Juan in a soft voice, "Don't want to be bitten anymore?"</p><p>"... Mmm."</p><p>Xiao Fangli pinched his chin. "Then give this prince another kiss."</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly raised her eyelashes.</p><p>The sensation on her neck still lingered, as if feathers had brushed it, leaving it wet.</p><p>This dampness came from one place.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at Xiao Fangli's lips.</p><p>Let him kiss me.</p><p>Let the Prince kiss me.</p><p>Last time, the Prince kissed his forehead.</p><p>It was very soft, and he didn't dislike it.</p><p>Lost in thought, Jiang Juan only snapped back to reality when the hand pinching her chin exerted a slight pressure.</p><p>Their eyes met, their breaths intertwining.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's lips were a deep red, and he smiled softly. His tongue traced his crimson lips, leaving a hint of moisture behind. "Not speaking means you permit it."</p><p>Pound, pound.</p><p>Jiang Juan could again hear her own heartbeat.</p><p>What should she say?</p><p>Pound, pound.</p><p>Her heart pounded wildly, as if anticipating something.</p><p>In a daze, Jiang Juan suddenly recalled what the Prince had just said to her.</p><p>—"Little Bodhisattva, do you know that you have moved your worldly desires?"</p>
