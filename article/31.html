						<p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes.</p><p>The token...</p><p>Just now, Duke of Ping mentioned it, and I didn't think about it. Now the Prince is also talking about this token.</p><p>Is it some kind of trinket?</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into deep thought.</p><p>Ah, it's a jade pendant!</p><p>Jiang Juan thought hard and finally remembered. When she first entered the book world, her father, Secretary Shang, gave her a jade pendant and said that since the engagement was dissolved, there was no need to keep the pendant.</p><p>Whether the engagement was dissolved or not wasn't important; mainly, the jade pendant was too beautiful. Jiang Juan couldn't bear to see it broken, so she kept it.</p><p>Jiang Juan told the truth, "I just thought a jade pendant was nice. When it almost got broken, I felt it was a pity, so I kept it."</p><p>Since entering the book world, her schedule has been too full. She received the jade pendant and then left for the prince's residence. Jiang Juan handed it to Lan Ting to keep, but soon after, she went to another villa, and the pendant was completely forgotten.</p><p>Xue Fangli heard this and didn't say anything, but his expression relaxed a little.</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment. The jade pendant symbolized her engagement with Duke of Ping. Keeping it in her possession wasn't appropriate, so Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli, "Prince, when we return to the residence tomorrow, I can find the pendant and ask someone to sell it on my behalf. How does that sound?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>His eyebrows twitched, and he slowly said, "It's not necessary."</p><p>"Why is it not necessary?"</p><p>Jiang Juan knew her stuff; although the jade pendant was small, in her time, it could fetch millions. Jiang Juan smiled mischievously and said, "Prince, I'll use Duke's jade pendant to support you."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Nian looked at him with bright eyes, and Xue Fangli's trace of displeasure and growing gloom faded away. Moments later, he smiled faintly and casually spoke up.</p><p>"It’s a pity to break it, selling it is unnecessary either; why don’t we put it in the warehouse of the Manor?"</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Jiang Juan was easygoing and nodded his head. Xue Fangli took off the canopy for him and without looking up ordered, "We won’t go to the villa; let’s return to the Manor."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Why are we returning to the Manor? We’re not going to the villa?</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his head in confusion. Xue Fangli glanced at him with a flat tone, "The heat is coming, the villa is too noisy."</p><p>That made sense; there were many insects on the mountain, and they would buzz incessantly when it got hot, making it really unbearable. The Prince’s sleep was also very light. It was indeed quieter in the Manor, so Jiang Juan believed him, "So that's the case."</p><p>However, since the Prince mentioned summer, Jiang Juan, who had always been worried about the intense heat without air conditioning during summer, hurriedly asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, how do you deal with summer?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Is it very hot?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said anxiously, "I’m so afraid of the heat."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a few moments. Jiang Juan’s eyebrows furrowed; he leisurely said, "I can give you ice cubes to use, and if you want to go to the summer villa… that’s fine too."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan, who had been like a dried fish, finally put his mind at ease—no more fear of being roasted in the hot summer. Jiang Juan happily said, "That’s good enough for me."</p><p>Gao Chengshi: "..."</p><p>He was about to say something, but his hand had already lifted a corner of the curtain. Hearing the voices inside, he quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p>The ice cubes were fine, but the Prince needed as much as possible. But what about the Summer Palace...</p><p>If he wanted it, he could only go and ask the Emperor for it.</p><p>He dared not go.</p><p>High Executive Affairs Officer felt a sense of sympathy.</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, inside the carriage, a man's voice sounded calmly: "Gao De, make time to visit the palace tonight."</p><p>High Executive Affairs Officer: "..."</p><p>Sighing, he endured it.</p><p>too much.</p><p>"Prince, here you are."</p><p>The jade pendant was of excellent quality, but Jiang Juan was not so attached to it. As soon as he handed over the jade pendant, he flopped onto the soft bed like a boneless chicken. Xue Fangli held the jade pendant in his hand without looking at it, only gazing at High Executive Affairs Officer.</p><p>"Prince, may I store this in the warehouse?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him with an ambiguous smile and said, "Store it well."</p><p>High Executive Affairs Officer was taken aback and cautiously asked, "May I store it for him?"</p><p>The storeroom of the Prince's Mansion was not a place where anything messy could be put. Xue Fangli nodded, and Gao Jiangshi understood immediately, his mouth wide open in delight.</p><p>This jade pendant is a treasure!</p><p>Gao Jiangshi took the jade pendant, wishing he could kiss it. However, knowing that he couldn't resist temptation and would end up losing the valuable item before he could even warm it up, he had already figured out how to deal with this jade pendant.</p><p>These past few days, he had been staying at his villa and hadn't had time to visit the Red Sleeve Pavilion. Hongyu was definitely going to pout again, but by giving her this jade pendant, he would quench her anger.</p><p>Gao Jiangshi grinned widely, thinking that Princess Consort was truly a living Bodhisattva. Since he came to the Prince's Mansion, the Prince had been less angry and more generous with rewards.</p><p>Although Gao Jiangshi was pleased, he was also astute enough to understand that the Prince wanted him to store this in the storeroom. He hurriedly said, "Your servant will take care of it right away."</p><p>He bowed and quickly left the chamber.</p><p>Jiang Juan lay lazily on the soft bed, lifting his head to see if Gao Jiangshi had left. When he confirmed that he had, he took off his shoes and socks, feeling comfortable as he stretched out flat.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, his gaze pausing for a moment as though in deep thought, fiddling with the small leaf purple sandalwood prayer beads on his wrist.</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "Prince, what's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond, so Jiang Juan sat up and looked down at his feet.</p><p>"Many scars."</p><p>Having some scars wasn't a big deal, but Jiang Juan's skin was fair, and these few scars were too dark to be inconspicuous.</p><p>However, Xue Fangli wasn't looking at those scars; he was noticing the red marks on Jiang Juan's ankles.</p><p>"Apply medicine well."</p><p>Xue Fangli finished speaking and asked him, "Why is your ankle red?"</p><p>Jiang Juan responded absentmindedly, "You must have bumped into something; it should be fine in a while."</p><p>He was too lazy to even bother taking off his shoes and socks, sliding down from the edge of the soft couch, which caused his ankle to get rubbed red as well.</p><p>Xue Fangli 'hummed' but did not look away. He stared for so long that Jiang Juan raised her head in confusion, "My Lord?"</p><p>This time, Xue Fangli did not respond and instead took something from his wrist, placing it on Jiang Juan's ankle.</p><p>The Buddha beads were smooth and still carried body heat; they had a deep brown color with a hint of purple.</p><p>Jiang Juan fiddled with the beads and asked him, "My Lord, why are you wearing these small leaf sandalwood beads?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. The dark color of the small leaf sandalwood beads contrasted sharply with Jiang Juan's fair ankle, like a bold brushstroke carelessly applied.</p><p>The beads were somewhat misshapen and did not match Jiang Juan's delicate ankle, but it was precisely this imperfection that added an extra touch of charm.</p><p>——It had been carved and worn on someone's ankle for years.</p><p>"Return them to me."</p><p>A long time passed before Xue Fangli responded like this.</p><p>Jiang Juan was bewildered, "Huh?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said calmly, "You gave this king a jade pendant; these small leaf sandalwood beads are compensation."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt that no compensation was necessary, after all, the king had not given him anything either. He pondered over what to say and then fell back onto the soft cushion, immediately taking in a shallow breath.</p><p>"…It hurts."</p><p>Jiang Juan was forced to sit upright, and his hand reached behind him. His fingertips touched a spot that hurt terribly. He couldn't pay attention to the beads anymore. Xue Fangli said, "Your Highness, please help me look at it."</p><p>After he got the needle yesterday, pain started in his back. Jiang Juan supported himself against Xue Fangli and lowered his head to unbutton his clothes.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, it had already grown dark.</p><p>The maids quietly lit the lamps. In the dim yellow light, Jiang Juan's shirt was half off, revealing smooth skin as delicate as porcelain below his shoulders, with a prominent shoulder blade that looked beautiful, but marred by a bruise.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his hand to touch it when he saw it.</p><p>"Your Highness, how is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked through the pain, and Xue Fangli replied, "The bruise is still there. It needs heat treatment."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh," and Xue Fangli ordered, "Get a basin of hot water."</p><p>The maid followed the order and hurried to prepare hot water. Xue Fangli then instructed Jiang Juan, "Lie down properly."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked back at him. "Your Highness, will you help me apply it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated but still obediently lay down. Soon, the maid returned with a basin of hot water. She placed the basin and took off a handkerchief, which Xue Fangli took.</p><p>The handkerchief wasn't soft enough, and after being soaked in hot water, applying it to his back was both scalding and painful. Apart from heat treatment, massage could also help with bruising, so Xue Fangli massaged him intermittently, making Jiang Juan feel even more pain.</p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p>"Hold on."</p><p>Jiang Juan was not at all afraid of pain and couldn't bear it. He felt uncomfortable and wanted to bite his hand again. Xue Fangli glanced at him and gave him the other hand, "Don't bite yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head carelessly and intended to push away his hand, but their fingertips barely touched. Xue Fangli rubbed his back again, and Jiang Juan finally managed to grasp this hand.</p><p>His flesh was delicate, and even if Xue Fangli's strength was lightened, it still hurt him a lot. However, this time, Jiang Juan did not cry shamefully; only the water vapor clung to his eyelashes. </p><p>The pain on his back was unbearable, so Xue Fangli pressed and rubbed it again. Jiang Juan raised his fair neck.</p><p>Several strands of black hair were wet and stuck to his neck. He breathed lightly, entwining his fingers tightly with Xue Fangli's. </p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, then paused in his actions.</p><p>Jiang Juan was in pain, not only squeezing his hand tightly but also curling his plump toes.</p><p>On the fair white ankle, dark small-leaf sandalwood beads jolted continuously.</p>
