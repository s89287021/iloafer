						<p>The fingertips were soft.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, and the movement of his eyelashes seemed sluggish due to the alcohol. His fingers touched places that were almost dazzling in their beauty, so he instinctively touched those areas several times.</p><p>"...I want to drink."</p><p>His response was delayed by a beat, and it took a while before Jiang Juan mumbled in a daze, slowly approaching Xue Fangli.</p><p>The sweet scent of herbs and the fragrance of osmanthus blossoms blended together. At this moment, Jiang Juan's body exuded a sweetness so extreme that even his flesh seemed to be sweet if one were to bite into him. However, he was completely oblivious to it, still preoccupied with the wine stains on his own fingers.</p><p>To drink means to take it from himself, Jiang Juan stared intently at the wine stains on the man's lips, barely having the strength to press against his shoulder and push himself forward slightly.</p><p>Their noses touched, their eyes meeting.</p><p>Even their breathing intertwined.</p><p>No matter how clear the alcohol was, it couldn't compare to the sweetness of the youth in his arms.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his crimson lips curling into an irresistibly seductive smile, his voice dripping with allure, "If you want to drink, why haven't you taken it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan lifted his hand, and his pale pink fingers once again touched Xue Fangli's lips. He rubbed them several times before slowly saying, "Alright."</p><p>The next moment, Jiang Juan retracted his hand, lowering his lashes and licking the wine stains on his own fingers one by one.</p><p>He was licking the wine stains left on his fingers from himself.</p><p>Afraid that he might fall, Xue Fangli kept holding him lightly in his arms and patiently waited for the prey to take the bait. However, upon seeing this scene, he suddenly gripped Jiang Juan's slender, supple waist tightly.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head and licked obediently, completely unaware of how terrifying the other person's expression had become or the danger lurking above. He only felt a sharp pain constricting him and said in bewilderment, "Your Highness, what are you doing?"</p><p>He put on an innocent face again.</p><p>He put on a blank expression.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him silently. Jiang Juan did not hear his reply and gently licked the tip of his finger, which was pale. The color of his tongue was shockingly red, leaving a wet, glossy mark on his finger.</p><p>His expression darkened as reason crumbled. Xue Fangli was about to pinch his chin again when Jiang Juan slowly said, "Your Highness, do you want to taste it too?"</p><p>"Let me give you another sip."</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his hand and placed it at the corner of Xue Fangli's lips, sharing it generously.</p><p>Since it was offered, Xue Fangli naturally did not refuse. However, the timing was impeccable—right when he no longer wanted to restrain himself and right when he did not care if he would scare him.</p><p>Xue Fangli grabbed Jiang Juan's wrist and said with a smile that was neither a laugh nor a sneer, "Do you really not understand or are you playing dumb for this King?"</p><p>"This King told you to lick your finger, not suck it."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, unsure what he meant. Seeing his confusion, Xue Fangli lowered his head and bit Jiang Juan's finger, punishing him with a forceful bite.</p><p>When the flesh even turned sweet.</p><p>Sweeter than autumn dew and more intoxicating as well.</p><p>He did not bite hard, but Jiang Juan still winced in pain, frowning slightly. He regretted sharing this joy with him. He tried to take back his hand, but it was grabbed tightly again, making it impossible for him to do so. He could only complain softly.</p><p>"…It hurts, don't bite me."</p><p>He usually pouted unconsciously; how much more so now when he was drunk and incoherent, his voice soft and his eyes filled with sorrow.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I already let you taste autumn dew."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Not enough."</p><p>He stared at Jiang Juan, not only biting the beautiful fingertip but also lightly licking it.</p><p>The feeling of licking his finger was different. It felt very hot and itchy. Jiang Juan gently curled his finger, but to no avail. His fingertip was held in between his lips, wet with saliva.</p><p>"Sweet."</p><p>Lowering his gaze at Jiang Juan, Xue Fangli slowly said two words, filled with implication.</p><p>Jiang Juan had tasted the alcohol on his fingertip before. He shook his head slowly, "Not sweet, it's very light."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled lightly, "Sweet."</p><p>They were not talking about the same thing, but Jiang Juan could not understand. He could only stare blankly at his bitten finger.</p><p>It seemed as though it was very sweet. The part that was held in his mouth, repeatedly licked and nibbled on, made Jiang Juan dizzy. He forgot to struggle and just submitted obediently.</p><p>After a long time, the finger was finally released. Xue Fangli stopped tormenting him and pulled him into his embrace. Jiang Juan obediently leaned against his shoulder but kept looking at his wet finger.</p><p>"Does it hurt?"</p><p>Xue Fangli slowly looked at him. Jiang Juan did not say anything; he just lowered his head and continued to look, then without warning, put his fingertip in his mouth again.</p><p>"Not sweet."</p><p>He lifted his eyes. The alcohol had made Jiang Juan's face wet, with his eyelashes fluttering. When they closed, the infinite beauty scattered, breathtakingly beautiful and irresistibly alluring.</p><p>Realizing he was fooled, Jiang Juan frowned, "It's not sweet at all, you're lying."</p><p>Facing such criticism, Xue Fangli did not immediately respond. He only looked at him leisurely for a moment before slowly speaking, "Perhaps it has been licked dry by this king."</p><p>"Next time, this king will leave some for you."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Jiang Juan said nonchalantly, as if accepting his words.</p><p>In reality, although Jiang Juan heard what Xue Fangli said, he could not understand it. He was simply too dazed and too tired. The dew from the autumn leaves had been drunk completely, leaving no sweetness in his mouth. Jiang Juan nuzzled a few times against him before gently closing his eyes.</p><p>Throughout, there was no defense whatsoever.</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli brushed away Jiang Juan's disheveled hair for him. He spoke casually as if talking to Jiang Juan or even to himself.</p><p>"Let us see how long this Wang can continue."</p><p>Jiang Juan slept blissfully unaware.</p><p>Almost the moment his eyes closed, he fell into a deep sleep. Only his eyelashes fluttered a few times before everything became silent.</p><p>The dream was sweet.</p><p>In Chengde Pavilion.</p><p>The Crown Prince Xue Chaohua sat calmly at the chessboard, engaged in a game with someone else. Zhang, a eunuch by his side, quietly approached and whispered something into his ear. Upon hearing it, Xue Chaohua frowned deeply.</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>He nodded twice, seemingly irritated, and could no longer focus on the game. The chess piece he was holding fell heavily onto the board. His opponent looked up and asked anxiously, "Your Highness, what is wrong?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua sighed, "It's all about the matter of Prefect Li of the Ministry of Punishment."</p><p>Recently, Prefect Li's son, Li Ming, had offended Lady Wang in a bookstore, which according to the law should have resulted in his execution. However, this matter could be seen as either major or minor, and since Prefect Li was related to Xue Chaohua's maternal family through collateral lines, he felt compelled to seek leniency.</p><p>In fact, Xue Chaohua had tried, but when he last sought an audience with Emperor Hongxing, it wasn't the right time. The emperor was still deliberating how to reward his fifth son. If Xue Chaohua brought up the matter again, he would definitely be unsuccessful, so for now, it was best left unmentioned.</p><p>Emperor Xing was a broad-minded person, and he was usually indifferent to etiquette. However, when it came to state affairs, he never allowed the concubines to interfere. His mother consort, Consort Mei, paced back and forth in frustration but could not personally plead her case. One day, driven by anger, she sent someone to urge him at Chengde Palace four or five times.</p><p>Xue Chaohua sighed, "Father Emperor shows exceptional favoritism towards Old Fifth. If this matter had nothing to do with him, this palace would not have had to worry for so long."</p><p>He had a good relationship with Duke of Anping. The parents of Duke of Anping had passed away, and he received the emperor's compassion, allowing him to study together with the crown prince in the main hall. They were of similar age, and given that Duke of Anping was steady and came from a prestigious lineage, Xue Chaohua also intended to win him over. As such, their interactions were quite close, and he had not kept these matters secret from Duke of Anping.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Duke of Anping's expression changed slightly.</p><p>Li Ming's case, he too had been present that day. And his offense against Princess Liwangfei was something that left Duke of Anping with a great sense of embarrassment. However, if one were to speak of justice, Li Ming did not deserve death.</p><p>At this point, Duke of Anping reminded him, "Your Highness, only the person who tied the bell can untie it."</p><p>Xue Chaohua smiled bitterly and said, "I have thought about it too, but that Old Fifth is simply a—"</p><p>He moved his lips, hesitating to say the word "madman," and Xue Chaohua continued, "Whenever he is displeased, who knows what madness he will exhibit."</p><p>Duke of Anping remained silent for a moment before shaking his head. "Why didn't Your Highness think about seeking Princess Liwangfei's intervention?"</p><p>Mentioning Jiang Juan, Duke of Anping felt an array of complex emotions.</p><p>He had never understood how, in just a few days after she married into the Liwang Palace, Jiang Juan seemed to be reborn, her past insecurities and melancholy completely gone, even her feelings towards him vanished.</p><p>Had he ever been infatuated with her?</p><p>Duke of Anping could not help but feel suspicious.</p><p>After their chance encounter at the bookstore, Duke of Anping had seen Jiang Juan once more in the Bahuayuan, only to see her being held by Prince Liwang, obediently, which stirred a secret regret in his heart.</p><p>—If he hadn't broken off the engagement, would it be him holding Jiang Juan now?</p><p>His thoughts sank, but Duke of Anping's expression remained unchanged. Instead, Xue Chaohua, reminded by him, suddenly understood and said, "That makes sense, Your Excellency! It might just work!"</p><p>"Find Father Emperor. Since he personally issued the decree, he must be advocating for Old Fifth's interests. It would be better to seek mercy from Princess Consort Li. I have noticed that Old Fifth treats her with such ——"</p><p>Xue Chaohua recalled that event. However, Marquis of Anping met Jiang Juan in Hundred Flowers Garden and did not know that inside the palace, Xue Fangli carried Jiang Juan all the way to the carriage. Xue Chaohua sighed, "Old Fifth may be mad, but he is incredibly fond of his princess consort."</p><p>Fond? </p><p>Could such a cruel Li Wang truly understand affection?</p><p>Marquis of Anping sneered inwardly, feeling inexplicable unease. When Xue Chaohua sensed this, she immediately came up with a plan. "I will have preparations made for tonight. I will invite Old Fifth and his princess consort to dine together. Then, I'll think of a way to keep Old Fifth away while I request favors from her."</p><p>Having said that, Xue Chaohua recalled something else and shook her head. "It won't work."</p><p>Marquis of Anping knew what Xue Chaohua meant. "It's all in the past."</p><p>Xue Chaohua did not agree. "That may be true, but no matter how long ago it was, there must still be some memories left."</p><p>"Speaking of which, I once had an old lover outside the palace and still keep a hairpin she gave me. I occasionally play with it, but now that she is married, we can't continue our relationship. However, if she requests my help in the future, I would consider her past relationship with me and assist her."</p><p>Marquis of Anping's expression changed as he suddenly remembered a jade pendant.</p><p>A jade pendant symbolizing their engagement, which should have been broken but was kept by Jiang Juan.</p><p>Could it be that he still harbored some affection like Prince Eldest?</p><p>Xue Chaohua did not know Marquis of Anping's thoughts and assumed he had reservations about approaching Li Wang. "Do not worry. I will arrange for you to meet with the princess consort alone without compromising you."</p><p>Marquis of Anping should have stayed out of this matter, but his desire for self-preservation was overridden by Jiang Juan's behavior towards him at the bookstore that day, which left him perplexed and unsatisfied. Thus, almost involuntarily, he agreed.</p><p>"... Good."</p><p>Xue Chaohua was overjoyed, patted his shoulder, and ordered, "Go quickly to prepare the banquet!"</p><p>The eunuch standing by hurriedly prepared to give the orders but, after a few steps, remembered something and whispered softly, "Your Highness, what a coincidence. Didn't you send away the singers and dancers just a few days ago? If we prepare the banquet without any performances, it seems rather inappropriate?"</p><p>That was true; Xue Chaohua almost forgot about it, but he didn't seem too concerned. "It's fine, go to Hongxiu Pavilion right away and let that old crow mother pick a few who sing and dance well and send them over."</p><p>The eunuch replied, "Yes, Your Highness."</p>
