						<p>Immediately, someone was ushered into the palace hall.</p><p>"Your subject has seen Your Majesty—"</p><p>Duke of Anping was about to bow when Emperor Hongxing waved his hand, "No need for that. No formalities are necessary."</p><p>Duke of Anping straightened his body and noticed two other people in the hall, immediately frowning.</p><p>Jiang Juan?</p><p>Why is he here?</p><p>Duke of Anping had entered the palace today to request Emperor Hongxing to grant him a marriage. As a favored son of heaven, Duke of Anping had always been dissatisfied with his arranged marriage to Jiang Juan. This country boy was timid and fearful, unable to look people in the eye, his gaze filled with gloom.</p><p>He intensely disliked this fiancé and did not wish to acknowledge this engagement, let alone consider Jiang Juan worthy of entering the duke's mansion.</p><p>However, his uncle disagreed with him.</p><p>Duke of Anping had lost both parents at a young age. His aunt, the Princess Dowager, had taken him in. He had been raised by his uncle and aunt, and this marriage was arranged by his uncle.</p><p>At that time, Duke of Anping had wanted to dissolve the engagement, but he had not yet succeeded to the title. According to the Great Xing laws, succeeding to the title would demote his status. Princess Dowager had repeatedly visited the palace to appeal to the emperor, and Duke of Anping did not want to cause trouble at that time, so he did not raise the issue again.</p><p>Now, however, the dukedom was firmly established, and his uncle and aunt were out of the capital on a trip. Duke of Anping planned to use this opportunity to cancel the engagement and request another marriage from the emperor.</p><p>By the time they returned, it would be too late. The emperor's word could not be changed, and even if his uncle was furious, there would be nothing he could do about it.</p><p>However...</p><p>Duke of Anping had not expected to encounter Jiang Juan.</p><p>Yesterday, he had already made his intentions clear, hoping that Jiang Juan would listen and not pester him any longer.</p><p>Thinking this way, the Marquis of Anping gave Jiang Juan a warning look. However, the young man did not act as he used to; instead of eagerly looking at him, the Marquis could only see his profile.</p><p>Standing beside the King, with fair skin, drooping eyelashes, and a strand of black hair falling onto his face that seemed strangely soft and obedient, the Marquis was taken aback. He wondered if it was just his imagination or if Jiang Juan really seemed different.</p><p>He seemed...</p><p>"Zhao Shi, have you come to the palace for something?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing spoke, interrupting the Marquis's contemplation of Jiang Juan. Coming back to his senses, the Marquis replied to the Emperor, "Your Majesty, I have a request."</p><p>A few days ago, the Marquis had visited Jiang Nian at the Ministry of Personnel. As he was leaving, Jiang Nian suddenly grabbed his hand and asked through tears, "My Lord, do you still need me?"</p><p>The Marquis's body shook as he could not speak. Jiang Nian said bitterly, "...don't you have me in your heart anymore?"</p><p>How could he not have him? </p><p>The Marquis's mind was filled with nothing but Jiang Nian; only Jiang Nian. Even the people he dreamed about were all Jiang Nian.</p><p>Though Jiang Juan was a useless young master of the Ministry of Personnel, Jiang Nian was different. As a golden-branch jade-leaf, Jiang Nian had a gentle and dignified demeanor. Although his appearance was merely above average in terms of looks, beauty lies within rather than on the surface, and he was known as the first beauty in the capital.</p><p>He was kind-hearted and full of talent, qualities that had long attracted the Marquis. Unfortunately, Jiang Nian had never reciprocated his feelings. The Marquis had originally planned to silently protect him but did not expect Jiang Nian to take the initiative and grasp his hand one day.</p><p>Overwhelmed with joy, the Marquis hugged Jiang Nian tightly. "Don't you know if I have you in my heart?"</p><p>Jiang Nian buried her face in his chest. The Marquis felt the warmth of the person in his arms, and his agitated emotions gradually calmed down. He made a silent decision.</p><p>—To annul his engagement with Jiang Juan and marry Jiang Nian.</p><p>"Your Majesty, I humbly request Your Highness to grant the hand of marriage between this subject and Young Master Jiang Nian of the Ministry of Revenue."</p><p>Duke Ping An finished speaking, his peripheral vision subconsciously scanning Jiang Juan.</p><p>In his view, Jiang Juan lacked discernment and was unable to gauge the times. Even if he had married King Li, it was unlikely that he had much sense of being a queen consort. Given Jiang Juan's past clingy behavior towards him, Duke Ping An felt he might even break down in public.</p><p>It wasn't just Duke Ping An; eyes with an almost imperceptible gaze also fell on Jiang Juan. Even the head steward, Wang, could not control his gaze and drifted over.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Why are they all looking at me?</p><p>The beloved of Duke Ping An was the past Jiang Juan; what does it have to do with the current Jiang Juan?</p><p>Thinking this way, Jiang Juan smiled, attempting to convey his blessings and simultaneously prove his innocence.</p><p>You are the main character in an attack role, and he is the main character in a receiving role. It's as if they were made for each other. Please lock onto them immediately.</p><p>Duke Ping An met Jiang Juan's gaze and was momentarily taken aback.</p><p>The young man looked at him with crystal-clear eyes, his soft lips curling upwards slightly, and his eyes forming a crescent moon arc.</p><p>He was already exceptionally beautiful to begin with, but this smile made him even more captivating. However, the young man's lip color was too pale, and his frame seemed overly frail, like a delicate porcelain beauty, fragile and easy to break.</p><p>Duke Ping An experienced a brief moment of confusion.</p><p>How has his demeanor changed so much?</p><p>Furthermore, whenever Jiang Juan encountered him in the past, he either lowered his head or tightly clenched his sleeves out of tension. Duke Ping An had always found his demeanor gloomy and his mannerisms vulgar, never realizing that his face could be so beautiful.</p><p>However...</p><p>How beautiful? It is merely a pretty shell; his heart is so malicious, he can never match the kindness of Xiao Nian.</p><p>After a brief moment of distraction, Duke Ping of An felt only surprise.</p><p>The young man laughed without care, completely indifferent as if an unimportant person was asking the emperor for permission to marry, and he just happened to be there.</p><p>He doesn't mind?</p><p>Duke Ping of An was puzzled in his heart.</p><p>Of course Jiang Juan didn't mind.</p><p>Noticing that Duke Ping of An was looking at him, Jiang Juan politely nodded at him, then withdrew his gaze and moved closer to Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him sideways. Jiang Juan tilted his head curiously and blinked at him, showing more familiarity with Xue Fangli than with Duke Ping of An, and he was also more willing to approach. Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time before smiling and lifting his eyes.</p><p>The rumors seem to be exaggerated.</p><p>Duke Ping of An unexpectedly locked eyes with Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him with a smile that wasn't quite a smile, his expression full of bone-chilling coldness. Duke Ping of An was startled, feeling danger all over his body as if he had been spotted by a fierce beast, shivering in fear. He hastily moved away his gaze.</p><p>At the same time, Emperor Hongxing spoke up, "Do you, Chancellor, know about this matter?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled and said, "You, child, are trying to use me to intimidate your uncle?"</p><p>Duke Ping of An lowered his head without speaking. He was originally thinking about how to answer but found himself distracted uncontrollably.</p><p>He could not understand Jiang Juan's attitude.</p><p>Just a few days ago, Jiang Juan had pushed Jiang Nian into the lake because of her being dumped. Yesterday, she insisted on keeping their engagement token and was unwilling to have that jade pendant broken. Why was he so indifferent today?</p><p>Duke of Pinghai did not speak; Emperor Xinghong thought for a moment and then shook his head, "I think it's inappropriate. Marriage is no trivial matter. If I agree and the groom later becomes dissatisfied, I would be doing more harm than good."</p><p>Duke of Pinghai finally came to his senses. He opened his mouth, "Your Majesty..."</p><p>Emperor Xinghong waved his hand, "I should not interfere in your family affairs. When the groom returns, you can discuss it with him yourselves."</p><p>Duke of Pinghai was filled with regret. He had come here full of determination but ended up distracted at a critical moment and failed to achieve his goal.</p><p>However, he did not give up. After thinking for a while, Duke of Pinghai said again, "Your Majesty..."</p><p>At this moment, someone outside the palace sent a signal to Wang Zongguan. Wang Zongguan nodded in understanding and whispered a few words to Emperor Xinghong. The emperor interrupted Duke of Pinghai, "You can say what you want later; for now, accompany me for dinner."</p><p>After a pause, Emperor Xinghong added, "Wu Wu [Scholar Fifth], recently Daoist Priest Shen has prepared some deer blood wine for me. Since your health is not good, try it as well."</p><p>Wang Zongguan brought out the blood-red deer blood wine and served it to Emperor Xinghong. The emperor suddenly said, "Wu Wu, by the way, didn't the groom serve as your grand tutor back then? Do you remember?"</p><p>Emperor Xinghong spoke calmly, but his teeth were stained red from drinking the blood wine, as if he was consuming raw meat and blood.</p><p>Xue Fali: "No particular impression."</p><p>The emperor did not say anything more, only expressing disappointment, "Back then, the groom was still a top scholar, riding through the capital city like a young hero. Now..."</p><p>He sighed deeply and turned to ask Duke of Pinghai, "Is your uncle still living his usual life, idling away his days fishing and drinking?"</p><p>Duke of Pinghai smiled helplessly, unsure of what to say.</p><p>Emperor Xinghong gave a cold snort. Eunuch Wang slowly stirred the blood wine with a spoon; the thick, blood-red liquid swirled in the cup. He then served Emperor Xinghong another sip, and soon his lips turned a deep crimson color.</p><p>"Your Highness, your slave — I mean, servant — is serving you."</p><p>The maid brought the deer antler blood wine, kneeling beside Schu Fangli. She tried her best to steady the cup, but fear of Schu Fangli made her uncontrollably tremble, causing the blood wine to slosh in the cup.</p><p>Hearing this, Emperor Xinghong casually said, "Fifth Brother, try it. This wine has a strong smell, but it works well. If you get used to it, I'll have Daoist Master Shen write down the recipe for you so you can drink it at home."</p><p>He rambled on, and with each opening and closing of his lips, his teeth, tongue, and even his entire mouth were covered in bloodstains. The heavy scent of blood spread throughout the hall. Schu Fangli stared blankly for a long time before lowering his eyelids.</p><p>The maid holding the cup was trembling.</p><p>As the blood wine swayed, a woman's incoherent sobbing reached Schu Fangli's ears.</p><p>"Are you — my child born after ten months of pregnancy? Why don't you turn to me? Why don't you come to me?"</p><p>"You bastard, you deserve to die, you deserve to die — !"</p><p>"I want you to eat my flesh and drink my blood. After your death, you will fall into the Avici Hell and never be able to escape!"</p><p>It was too noisy, too loud.</p><p>His temples started throbbing, sharp pain surged through his head, and everything before Schu Fangli turned crimson. He smelled the nauseating smell of blood and remembered Emperor Xinghong with bloody lips. His breath gradually grew cold.</p><p>What a disgusting sight.</p><p>His head pounded fiercely, and he became increasingly agitated, unleashing an endless fury until he heard a voice.</p><p>"Your Highness, what's wrong?"</p><p>The voice was soft and laced with concern.</p><p>Meanwhile, his sleeves were tugged a few times, and the bloody scent near Xue Fangli’s nose gradually faded, replaced by the unique herbal fragrance he had smelled on the young man all along.</p><p>An impossibly clean and pure aura.</p><p>Jiang Juan noticed his lack of response and said to the anxious maid, "Put it down first."</p><p>“Clang—!”</p><p>The blood wine splashed onto Xue Fangli’s black outer robe. The maid froze for a moment before bursting into tears right there. She hastily knelt down and pleaded for mercy: "Your Highness, slave…slave…"</p><p>Xue Fangli was extremely weary and ignored her, simply closing his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Juan vaguely sensed that something was amiss with Xue Fangli and softly asked him, "Your Highness, what’s wrong?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing frowned and inquired, "Old Five, are you okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond. Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment, then took his hand to examine it. Fortunately, there were no injuries. Just as he was about to let go, the hand suddenly tightened its grip on his.</p><p>Jiang Juan could only allow himself to be held by him.</p><p>However, as Xue Fangli gripped harder, Jiang Juan felt an increasing pain.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing asked again, "Old Five, are you okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli still did not speak. Jiang Juan had no choice but to raise his head and answer for him while enduring the pain: "Your Highness is fine."</p><p>His eyes were wet and his lashes stuck together softly, as if he wanted to cry but did not. Prince Ping pretended to look away casually and immediately froze in place.</p><p>He could not describe his emotions, only hearing his heart pounding like a drum.</p><p>But this was entirely inappropriate.</p><p>How could he be attracted by shallow appearances?</p><p>Emperor Xinghong said, "Old Five, the Lingguang Palace where you used to live should still have clean clothes. Go change into something first."</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan could not speak for him and could only wave his hand weakly. Xue Falí replied coolly, "Mm."</p><p>Then he released his hand.</p><p>Xue Falí got up, and someone immediately led the way for him. Jiang Juan was unsure whether to follow. Emperor Xinghong sent a glance to Wang Zongguan, who quickly put on a big smile and said, "This is Your Majesty’s first time entering the palace. Would it not be better if I showed you around?"</p><p>In this completely unfamiliar environment, Jiang Juan instinctively turned to Xue Falí for help. His lashes were still moist, and Xue Falí paused in his steps, nodding expressionlessly after a moment. Only then did Jiang Juan agree, "Alright."</p><p>Prince Ping seemed to have understood something from the scene.</p><p>No wonder Jiang Juan treated him like a stranger, no wonder Jiang Juan remained unmoved throughout.</p><p>He was afraid of the king.</p><p>Even whether to stay or leave could not be decided by himself.</p><p>Had he been bullied just now?</p><p>With this thought in mind, when Jiang Juan passed Prince Ping, Prince Ping whispered to him, "I have something to say to you later."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him in surprise, hurriedly left, and pretended not to have heard anything.</p><p>Approaching the protagonist would bring misfortune.</p><p>Lying low and faking death, he excelled at it.</p><p>Jiang Juan almost had "refusal" written on her face, but Prince Ping An was even more convinced of his guess.</p><p>Soon, only Prince Ping An and Emperor Hongxing remained in the palace. The emperor knew Prince Ping An's temper—once he was set on something, he became fiercely determined—and he sighed helplessly, "What? Still hoping I will grant you a marriage?"</p><p>Prince Ping An was just about to speak when he inadvertently recalled Jiang Juan's wet lashes and his own damp face, which looked like petals glistening with dew.</p><p>Unconsciously, Prince Ping An shook his head.</p>
