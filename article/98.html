						<p>Jiang Juan, that little bitch, was getting ready to go out. You could use your powerful purchasing power to get rid of her. Jiang Juan subconsciously leaned into Xue Fangli’s arms.</p><p>The pieces of jade were picked out, and Sun Taishi bandaged Jiang Juan up before instructing him, "Don’t move around or come in contact with water for the time being."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded weakly.</p><p>He was leaning against Xue Fangli, having merely gotten his hair wet during the herbal bath. Now, beads of sweat had formed on his forehead, and the scent of sweet herbs permeated his body.</p><p>Xue Fangli smelled his scent, his hand occasionally rubbing Jiang Juan’s neck in a rather absent-minded yet relieved manner.</p><p>Sun Taishi, who had never seen anyone more afraid of pain than Jiang Juan, could not help but chuckle and say, “Rest well.”</p><p>Jiang Juan was indeed tired. He lifted his head and asked Xue Fangli listlessly, "Prince Wang, how am I supposed to get back?"</p><p>Unable to move and unable to walk, he certainly couldn’t ask a girl in Lanting to carry him.</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, “There’s no need. Rest here.”</p><p>He stood up, and the entire bed was now Jiang Juan’s. Jiang Juan fell asleep almost immediately, but while drowsy, he suddenly recalled a passage from a book.</p><p>—"That night, Prince Li went to another villa. In the middle of the night, he suffered from a severe illness, coughing up blood uncontrollably. The imperial physician who accompanied him rushed over but was unable to do anything about it. Before dawn, news of Prince Li’s death had already reached the capital, and upon hearing this, the emperor flew into a rage, ending the court session for three days and executing more than a hundred people."</p><p>In the middle of the night, he suffered from a severe illness.</p><p>Before dawn, news of his death had already reached the capital.</p><p>When Doctor Sun finished treating Jiang Juan's foot injury, it seemed like dawn was already breaking.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>Lanting had just entered the room and was wiping Jiang Juan's face. Seeing this, she quietly asked, "Did I wake up the young master?"</p><p>Jiang Juan absentmindedly shook his head and turned to look outside, only to see that it was already starting to get light.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>What kind of novel is this? The Prince's character is so different, and the plot doesn't match at all.</p><p>In the middle of the night, the Prince didn't have a sudden illness; instead, a pack of wolves appeared.</p><p>Wait a moment.</p><p>With so many wolves, if he had come later or not at all, and had ignored the unusual behavior of the pups, wouldn't something happen to the Prince?</p><p>Perhaps, the Prince's death was an accident from the beginning, not a sudden illness?</p><p>He had spent almost half the night with the Prince, and the Prince really didn't have a sudden illness.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>So, he seemed to have inadvertently saved the Prince and changed the plot.</p><p>Realizing this, Jiang Juan felt rather complicated.</p><p>The Prince was a great good man. Every time Jiang Juan thought about his fate, she felt a sense of regret. Now that the Prince was safe and sound, it could not have been better.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan did not feel well at all. He had come to be a salted fish and had even planned how he would live happily after the Prince's death.</p><p>But now...</p><p>His life as a salted fish was gone, and his happiness too.</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to cry but could not shed a tear. He lowered his head and despairingly slammed his forehead against the armrest.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Seeing the situation, Xue Fangli said coolly, "Nothing."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked down at him. The young man had pale skin; even with a light impact, his forehead turned red. Xue Fangli asked, "What are you unhappy about?"</p><p>But Jiang Juan could not tell the truth. He lazily replied, "...My feet hurt."</p><p>Not mentioning it would have been fine, but once he said it out loud, Jiang Juan realized another issue.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be.</p><p>Why was the salted fish the one who got injured?</p><p>Was this the consequence of not trying hard enough?</p><p>Unable to control himself, he started daydreaming.</p><p>No way.</p><p>He only wanted to be a salted fish, not a Concubine.</p><p>Maybe he should run away?</p><p>According to the plot setting, he still had an uncle. Going back to the countryside to seek refuge with his uncle wasn't a bad idea. The more Jiang Juan thought about it, the more feasible it seemed, and he regained some spirit. "Prince..."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Xue Fangli responded indifferently, his gaze lingering on Jiang Juan for a long time, his expression hard to read.</p><p>He was lying.</p><p>The reason the teenager was unhappy wasn't due to his foot injury.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt guilty as he said, "On our wedding day, you promised to send me off and asked me again in a few days. Now, you can ask me again."</p><p>Xue Fangli's eyebrows twitched, "What's up?"</p><p>"I've changed my mind," Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "I thought about it, and I feel like I've been causing you trouble all along. Maybe... you should send me off after all."</p><p>After hearing this, Xue Fangli didn't immediately respond, his expression unchanged. He merely raised his rosy lips and smiled indifferently before saying regretfully, "It's too late."</p><p>As the teenager cried in his arms, if Jiang Juan had said he wanted to leave even a minute or second earlier, he would have sent him away. But he didn't, and now that Jiang Juan wanted to leave, it was too late; Xue Fangli had already changed his mind.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, smiling gently. "You saved this king's life; I don't have time to repay my debt of gratitude, let alone be bothered."</p><p>"It can't be considered bothersome at all."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... It is."</p><p>He still hadn't given up, trying to struggle again. Jiang Juan had a flash of inspiration and said, "Your Highness, I've always been plagued by a chronic illness. The master said that there would be a calamity in the year eighteen, and I might not survive it. I'm afraid I'll pass on my sickness to you."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyelids, "It's fine; this king already has an incurable condition, which is unrelated to you."</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli thoughtfully asked, "This is the reason why you're unhappy?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, unable to explain it further, so he nodded, "Yeah, I'm afraid of burdening Your Highness."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time before walking over and extending his hand. His pale fingertips brushed against the red spot on the teenager's forehead. He smiled lightly, "You have injuries on your feet, it's not suitable to travel around. Just rest and recover in peace; don't think too much."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... Alright."</p><p>He had forgotten about this matter. So Jiang Juan was truly unable to leave for now.</p><p>However—</p><p>Was the king's incurable condition hemoptysis?</p><p>Jiang Juan recalled what he said on their wedding day.</p><p>"—This king does not have many days left, would you like me to send you away?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a few seconds.</p><p>Perhaps, or maybe, he could still become the saltiest fish.</p><p>It couldn't be, how could he think that way?</p><p>Jiang Juan loudly rebuked herself in her heart but then honestly gave up.</p><p>——Three chapters had passed; perhaps it wouldn’t be too bad if she endured a bit longer?</p><p>Shangshu Mansion.</p><p>Jiang Nian picked up a cup of hot tea, lowered his head, and blew lightly on it. The tea leaves swirled in the cup as the steam hit his face. However, his thoughts drifted uncontrollably.</p><p>In his previous life, he was already heading to another estate.</p><p>——Emperor Li had died.</p><p>He feared this man so much that even upon hearing of his death, he did not want to go and pay his respects or see him one last time. But as the Empress Consort of Emperor Li, Jiang Nian had no choice but to do so, and he boarded the carriage.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Nian did not catch up with them.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, the emperor personally rushed to the estate. He mourned deeply upon seeing it, unable to bear looking any longer, and ordered that the coffin be sealed and sent directly to the mausoleum.</p><p>Relieved, Jiang Nian came back to his senses but couldn’t help frowning again.</p><p>Why hadn't Father returned yet?</p><p>Today should not have been an official court day.</p><p>In Jiang Nian's memory, Emperor Li had died in the middle of the night on that day. The emperor did not attend the morning court session, and Father should have already returned.</p><p>An uneasy feeling suddenly rose in his heart.</p><p>Another two incense sticks later, there was finally some noise outside the door.</p><p>"Xiao Nian, what's wrong?"</p><p>Mr. Jiang strode over, having heard from his servants that Jiang Nian was waiting for him in the study. He hurriedly approached and asked, "Is there something?"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook her head and asked, "Father, where did you go? Why are you only back now?"</p><p>Mr. Jiang laughed and said, "I went to court today since it wasn't a rest day."</p><p>Court?</p><p>Jiang Nian was taken aback and hesitantly asked, "Father, did something happen last night?"</p><p>Mr. Jiang never kept anything from him about court matters; he had intentionally prepared Jiang Nian in advance. However, there wasn't much happening today, so Mr. Jiang replied, "Nothing happened. What's the matter with you?"</p><p>Jiang Nian's unease grew stronger as she cautiously asked, "...Was everything alright at Li Wangfu last night?"</p><p>At the mention of Li Wangfu, Mr. Jiang seemed to recall something and casually said, "Oh, Li Wangfu? Nothing much happened there."</p><p>Jiang Nian pressed on, "What happened?"</p><p>Mr. Jiang spoke calmly, "The people from Li Wangfu told me that Jiang Juan got injured last night and won't be able to return home tomorrow."</p><p>Jiang Nian blurted out, "Then what about Li Wang?"</p><p>Mr. Jiang was puzzled, "What about Li Wang?"</p><p>"Is he alright?"</p><p>"What could happen to him?"</p><p>Jiang Nian looked at Mr. Jiang for a moment and saw his genuinely confused expression, clearly unaware of the situation. She couldn't help but tightly pinch her palm.</p><p>How could this happen?</p><p>It seems that Wang did not have any trouble, and the Emperor did not adjourn court today.</p><p>Since his rebirth, Jiang Nian has experienced events that are no different from those of his previous life; he has never encountered anything unexpected.</p><p>"This shouldn't be..."</p><p>Seeing him pale, Chancellor Jiang asked with concern, "Xiao Nian, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p>
