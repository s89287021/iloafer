						<p>"Juan'er, are you going to the library?"</p><p>Jiang Juan just finished packing up his things. His roommate heard the noise and quickly took off his headphones, saying to him, "Hold my seat for me; I'll be there after I finish this."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with a "mm-hm." When he heard that his roommate agreed, he turned back around, typing rapidly on the keyboard while chatting with someone.</p><p>"Juan'er? He's my roommate."</p><p>"You definitely haven't heard of him. He was sick before and took a leave of absence; he hasn't come to school ever since."</p><p>"It's not too bad, though. He has heart disease, so he really doesn't need to go to school, but he needs an operation."</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Juan closed the dormitory door and walked out of the building, feeling a wave of heat hit him.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed.</p><p>It was so hot; he really wanted to go back to his dormitory to turn on the air conditioner.</p><p>Why is the library so far away?</p><p>When will the school bus come?</p><p>It has been about four months since Jiang Juan came back from another era through a book.</p><p>In his family's eyes, after the surgery was successful, Jiang Juan had just been too weak and slept for five days. In reality, Jiang Juan had lived through many years in another time.</p><p>After returning to modern times, Jiang Juan felt somewhat lost. Seeing that he was gloomy every day, his cousin suggested to his family that Jiang Juan continue his studies.</p><p>Jiang Juan almost made the hospital her home, but she still managed to keep up with her studies. Her family had hired a tutor for her, and she also took part in the college entrance exam, though she had taken a leave of absence due to her health condition and never officially enrolled.</p><p>With the surgery successful, life should now return to normal, so Jiang Juan came to A University. Who could have thought that after being an empress for such a long time, she would return as a student, only to find herself caught in the midst of the final exams with several papers due and many books to read. Jiang Juan was practically losing hope.</p><p>After waiting for quite some time, the school bus finally arrived. Jiang Juan got on board and quickly reached the library.</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't arrive too early; the first floor was almost fully occupied. So as soon as she stepped into the elevator, she directly chose the sixth floor.</p><p>Recently, the library always went dark at night, with higher floors causing more inconvenience, so fewer people ventured to the sixth floor.</p><p>Jiang Juan picked a spot by the window and started reading her books.</p><p>Oh no, there are so many words.</p><p>I feel dizzy from all these characters.</p><p>After only a few pages, Jiang Juan fell asleep on the table. Her phone, which was lying beside her, suddenly lit up. She reached out to check it; it was a message from her roommate about their departure.</p><p>[Juan-er, I'm here.]</p><p>[Which floor are you on?]</p><p>Jiang Juan typed back a few words.</p><p>[I'm on the sixth floor.]</p><p>Twenty minutes later, her roommate emerged from the elevator wearing headphones and listening to music, swaying along with the rhythm. After taking just a few steps, he suddenly spotted Jiang Juan's spot and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>"Juan-er, why are you sitting here?"</p><p>The roommate pressed the earphone and paused the music. He whispered to Jiang Juan, "Hurry up and leave, we can't sit here."</p><p>Jiang Juan was puzzled, "Why can't we sit here?"</p><p>The roommate muttered, "We can't afford to provoke that madman."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>He looked at his roommate blankly. There wasn't anything special about this spot; Jiang Juan had chosen it randomly. If pressed, she would say that the place was relatively quiet and offered a good view.</p><p>Seeing her confusion, the roommate recalled that Jiang Juan hadn't been at school recently and explained in more detail, "Do you know the Xue family? That is, Old Xue... whom we often see on TV."</p><p>As he spoke, the roommate pulled out his phone, typed a name, and showed it to Jiang Juan. Indeed, it was an elderly man with considerable prestige. Jiang Juan nodded, "Yes, I know him."</p><p>The roommate continued, "They have only one son in the Xue family; the future Crown Prince is studying at our school, he—"</p><p>"He has severe bipolar disorder."</p><p>The roommate asked Jiang Juan, "Do you know why our library is so luxurious? During military training, when he had a breakdown and fought with someone, his family donated a sum of money."</p><p>In reality, it wasn't entirely the Crown Prince's fault. He was the one who had secretly photographed a woman in the restroom, and upon coming out, he encountered the Crown Prince. Afraid of being reported to school, he begged and threatened suicide, continuously harassing him until he finally provoked the Crown Prince.</p><p>What happened after that was unclear to everyone since there were no cameras in the restroom. When security arrived, the man was covered in blood, pinned against a railing with most of his body hanging over. The Crown Prince's voice was detached, "Still want to die? If you do, I'll make it happen."</p><p>"I think he might have really wanted to kill him then."</p><p>The roommate had been at the scene and found the Crown Prince's fury truly terrifying. After describing the incident to Jiang Juan, he added, "Later, his former high school classmates said he has bipolar disorder, so..."</p><p>"Let's go, go, you usually sit here. Let's find another spot. No one dares provoke him."</p><p>Jiang Juan was somewhat distracted.</p><p>The surname Xue.</p><p>What about his character and conduct?</p><p>Why is that, just a coincidence?</p><p>"Tired."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan staring blankly, his roommate quickly grabbed him and pushed him, "Hurry up, in case he has an episode, we won't..."</p><p>"Clang," the sound of a bottle of mineral water being placed on the table echoed. The noise wasn’t loud, but it was sudden enough to make Jiang Juan instinctively look over.</p><p>He saw a hand, graceful in shape with clear joints.</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched; he almost held his breath.</p><p>The other person was a tall and slender young man, with fierce eyes and a cold demeanor.</p><p>His skin was very pale, but his lips were an extremely red shade, making him look like someone with rosy cheeks and white teeth. However, there was an aura of hostility all over him. He lifted his eyelid and glanced over casually.</p><p>In the next second, the young man also paused.</p><p>Silence, long silence.</p><p>After a while, the young man spoke up. He uttered one word, "You..."</p><p>The roommate almost fainted with fright. Just as they were talking about Cao Cao, here was Xue Fangli!</p><p>What had he just said?</p><p>In case he has an episode.</p><p>Grass.</p><p>Did he hear it?</p><p>And Juan'er, sitting in his usual spot.</p><p>The roommate struggled to swallow a mouthful of saliva, feeling that their fate was sealed, especially when Xue Fangli picked up the bottle of mineral water from the table and put it back down.</p><p>They were done for.</p><p>The roommate's legs went weak, and he felt dizzy, but the next moment—</p><p>"Do you want to drink some?" Xue Fangli asked.</p><p>The roommate froze, "Ah? I don't..."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "I want to."</p><p>Xue Fangli said "Mm," as he naturally unscrewed the cap and handed the bottle of mineral water to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan took it.</p><p>There was still frost on the bottle of mineral water, emitting a faint chill; Jiang Juan's fingertips got wet. He bent down to take a small sip, then slowly lifted his head, squinting his eyes at Xue Fangli and smiling, "Thank you, you're really a good person."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him, his eyebrows twitching but saying nothing.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan said again, "I'm Jiang Juan, nickname Jiang Lai."</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Xue Fangli."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and slowly said, "Hello, nice to meet you."</p><p>Xue Fangli let out a soft sigh, reaching out to pinch the soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face. He smiled ambiguously and said, "Wrong, it's been a long time since we last saw each other."</p><p>Jiang Juan stared at him, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. After a long while, he finally changed his tone and said, "Mm, it has been a long time since we last saw each other."</p><p>They had met after a long absence, but someone seemed quite out of place.</p><p>Roommate: "???"</p><p>What situation was this??</p><p>Shouldn't they be getting beaten up??</p><p>What was the mineral water in Juanyi's hand??</p><p>Xue Fangli even returned the bottle cap to him!?</p><p>This didn't make sense!?</p>
