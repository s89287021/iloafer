						<p>"Sir! Sir——!"</p><p>"Master, please have mercy on him. Please, sir, Young Master is frail. Spare him..."</p><p>The sharp cry tinged with sobs woke Jiang Juan from his dream abruptly. Before he could react, someone pulled him roughly to the ground.</p><p>Pain, intense pain.</p><p>Jiang Juan's muddled consciousness barely came back into focus.</p><p>Jiang Juan found the voice increasingly familiar. A sense of unease began to rise in his heart.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He seemed to understand.</p><p>Wasn't this the novel 'I Became a Spoiled Star After Rebirth' that his cousin had shared with him last night?</p><p>Back then, he was about to be taken to the operating table for a heart repair surgery with only a 10% success rate. Jiang Juan joked about taking a chance and turning his bicycle into a motorcycle, but deep down, he was still nervous. He tossed and turned in bed at night, and his cousin suggested, "Hey, bro, I read a novel where the cannon fodder character has the same name as you. Want to check it out together?"</p><p>Since he couldn't sleep anyway, Jiang Juan asked his cousin for the address. The cannon fodder character was hated from the first chapter onwards, so Jiang Juan said, "Should I memorize and recite the entire book now in case I get pulled into the story tomorrow?"</p><p>His cousin laughed incessantly, and Jiang Juan flipped through a few more chapters.</p><p>Starting over, the male protagonist makes every effort to change the plot and successively seduces his minister of Rites' father, his fellow scholar who was from a noble family, and several princes in the palace, becoming the group's favorite and main beloved.</p><p>The name of this male protagonist is Jiang Nian, also known as Xiao Nian.</p><p>Jiang Juan thought seriously, her eyelashes lowered, giving off a sense of obedience.</p><p>Minister Jiang was taken aback at first and then frowned.</p><p>Though this Jiang Juan seemed honest, her thoughts were quite vicious.</p><p>Minister Jiang had never favored his son. He grew up in the countryside, raised by his grandfather, developing a timid personality that was unsuitable for public appearances. Had it not been for his severe heart disease requiring medical attention, Minister Jiang would never have brought him back to the capital city; this son only brought him shame.</p><p>As he finished speaking, he threw a jade pendant at Jiang Juan, after which Minister Jiang continued.</p><p>"—You and Jiang Nian are as different as heaven and earth. The engagement is dissolved, and there's no need for you to keep this pendant anymore. Take care of yourself."</p><p>The pendant was about to fall when Jiang Juan hurriedly pressed it to her chest, intercepting it in a desperate attempt—while the annulment happened, the jade pendant was innocent; such a beautiful piece with its clear water pattern would be a waste if broken.</p><p>Focused on examining the pendant, Jiang Juan remained silent as Minister Jiang held it in his hand and asked her, "Jiang Juan, do you have any complaints?"</p><p>Jiang Juan obtained a jade pendant and, of course, was not dissatisfied. However, for Jiang Juan in the book, there were too many things that troubled him.</p><p>First, without knowing what would happen to Duke of Pingan afterward, rumors in the palace suggested that this King Li, despite being an invalid, had a cruel disposition, was unpredictable, and acted absurdly to the extreme; he even killed his own stepmother with his own hands!</p><p>Moreover, Jiang Juan in the book came to the capital from the countryside precisely because of his engagement to Duke of Pingan. He held this fiancé in very high regard. Therefore, Jiang Juan did not hesitate to fake an illness and travel all the way to the capital.</p><p>That was right; he actually did not have a heart disease, at most there was some congenital deficiency, which was far from requiring treatment in the capital.</p><p>However, he did not know that on the second day of their wedding, King Li died.</p><p>When Jiang Juan read this part, he found it unbelievable and spiritually questioned his cousin, "How could anyone not want to be a salted fish?"</p><p>His cousin replied, "As the main character, one must have ambition. How can they be useless?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sincerely said, "If I were to enter the book, I would follow the plot and endure until the Prince dies. Then I would be the saltiest fish, happy like a deity."</p><p>But...</p><p>Now he really had entered the book.</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into deep thought.</p><p>"Sir Jiang, Sir Jiang——!" The matchmaker rushed over excitedly, "It's time! Third Young Master needs to go to the Prince Li’s Manor!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan suddenly raised his eyes, his gaze astonishing. Seeing his face, the matchmaker was taken aback.</p><p>The young man had an exceptionally handsome appearance. Even in his plain, simple-colored attire, not a bit of his beauty was concealed. Perhaps due to the earlier pulling, half of his hair fell over his shoulders. The young man's skin was too pale and his lips too light, making him seem even more frail, as if he would scatter with a breeze.</p><p>They all say that the Third Prince of the Shangshu Mansion came from a rural area, and was imbued with the mannerisms of a small-town farmer. Seeing him today, how could he be so… so… out of this world?</p><p>Could it really be that such a divine prince pushed the Second Prince into the lake?</p><p>The midwife couldn’t help but speculate. Not to mention her, even Jiang Shangshu was somewhat stunned, finding Jiang Juan’s eyes overly clear and different from his usual brooding gaze.</p><p>But he didn’t give it much thought, merely snorting, “What? You have something to say?”</p><p>Jiang Juan strained to grab onto his sleeve and finally spoke for the first time since entering the story: “Quick, help me up; don’t miss the auspicious moment.”</p><p>Jiang Shangshu: "???" </p><p>He lifted his sleeves and took a step back as if Jiang Juan were some filthy thing he wanted nothing to do with. Jiang Shangshu assumed that the shock had driven him mad and said dismissively, “Men, carry the Third Prince into the sedan chair.”</p><p>March 21st, a favorable day for weddings.</p><p>Outside the Wang Mansion, lanterns hung from every beam, and firecrackers blazed in celebration, creating quite a lively scene.</p><p>The flower-laden sedan jolted as Jiang Juan sat inside, desperately trying to recall relevant plot points on the spot.</p><p>There was not much information about this King Li in the book. Apart from being a sickly individual, he was described with two words: </p><p>Indifferent to propriety, ruthless and tyrannical.</p><p>Regarding this wedding, the story’s Jiang Juan had already bitten his tongue to death before arriving at the scene. The main character, however, had some memories of her previous life.</p><p>—"King Li is an unfathomable man who inspires fear and terror. Jiang Nian recalls bowing her head as soon as she got out of the sedan chair, not daring to look up even a little. The entire journey was filled with heart-pounding anxiety. What made it more terrifying was that he fell ill halfway through; Jiang Nian witnessed King Li killing many servants, blood flowing like a river.”</p><p>It seemed rather horrifying.</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to bolster her courage internally.</p><p>There is no difficult job, only brave dogs.</p><p>The problem isn't big; he won't make it past three chapters, but Jiang Juan will.</p><p>"New arrival—!"</p><p>Xi Po shouted loudly, and the people from the Wangfu hurried forward to greet him. Jiang Juan took a deep breath and was helped down from the sedan chair. As soon as his feet touched the ground, he heard a whizzing sound, and an arrow shot towards him.</p><p>Jiang Juan froze in place as the long arrow narrowly grazed his earlobe, severing a lock of hair that stuck to the sedan chair behind him.</p><p>Jiang Juan's face turned pale with fright. He instinctively raised his head only to hear more "whooshes" as two arrows flew towards him. All Jiang Juan could think of was:</p><p>There are troublemakers trying to ambush me!</p><p>In his panic, Jiang Juan locked eyes with a pair of smiling ones.</p><p>The man was slender and erect, like bamboo or a crane. His skin was pale, but his lips were a vivid red. He wore a black-gold robe; the colors should have been flamboyant, but his dignified demeanor suppressed any trace of arrogance, making him appear exquisitely noble.</p><p>His identity was clear at a glance.</p><p>Duke Li, Xue Fangli.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan looking at him, Xue Fangli casually nodded in greeting. He drew his bowstring and released it again, sending another arrow towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Whoosh—!"</p><p>"My Lord, enough, enough!" the steward of the Wangfu whispered, "Three arrows decide everything; three arrows are sufficient."</p><p>Xue Fangli retracted his hand, handing the bow and arrow to the steward, and slowly approached Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly, not answering.</p><p>Is this King Li?</p><p>That King Li who disregards human ethics and is tyrannical and capricious?</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli said sincerely, "Third Young Master, I was rude."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>It took Jiang Juan a long time before he slowly shook his head, "Ah, it's fine."</p><p>Seeing this, Xue Fangli still looked apologetic, "I'm glad Third Young Master is fine. I just remembered that Third Young Master has heart disease and cannot withstand fright; we should have informed him in advance."</p><p>He smiled after saying this, exuding a clear and bright demeanor, like chrysanthemums among jade trees.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Is there something wrong?</p><p>Jiang Juan did not speak, looking utterly bewildered. Xue Fangli then spoke slowly, "By the way, I heard that Third Young Master married into King Li's residence not of their own will. If you truly do not wish to..."</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately came back to his senses and hurriedly replied, "I am not unwilling, I was willing!"</p><p>He really did come willingly to be a salted fish, more genuine than pearls!</p><p>Xue Fangli was stunned, looking down at him. The young man's tone was firm, his eyes bright, showing no sign of reluctance, only joy and anticipation.</p><p>Joy and anticipation?</p><p>Is this Third Young Master of the Ministry of Revenue not afraid of him?</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow slightly.</p><p>After a long moment, Xue Fangli extended his hand towards Jiang Juan with a half-smile and said, "Third Young Master, shall we proceed with the ceremony?"</p>
