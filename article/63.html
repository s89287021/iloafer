						<p>My Lord?</p><p>Why has My Lord come here?</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to turn around in delight when his movement suddenly froze.</p><p>They had just had a fight.</p><p>My Lord was still angry.</p><p>Jiang Juan dared not look at him anymore, feeling like a dried-up fish with no way out. He preferred to bury himself like an ostrich.</p><p>He tried to suppress his emotions, lowering his head without noticing Xue Fangli's gaze fall upon him.</p><p>Jiang Juan's attempt to evade made Xue Fangli's demeanor grow colder by several degrees. After looking at him for a moment, he slightly narrowed his eyes and merely glanced indifferently toward Mei Fei.</p><p>A huge sense of pressure overwhelmed him, intense fear rising in his heart. Mei Fei felt flustered.</p><p>She held the phoenix seal and managed the harem. According to the regulations set by the six emperors, she should maintain some courtesy when meeting with the king, but he had opened his mouth recklessly, showing no respect. Mei Fei should have been angry at this lack of decorum, but he was a madman.</p><p>How could one reason with a madman?</p><p>Who could make a madman follow rules?</p><p>Though Mei Fei was domineering, she was not stupid. She forced a smile, "My Lord, what a coincidence that you've come just as we were talking about you."</p><p>"I was merely joking with your Lady..."</p><p>She used the technique of speaking indirectly, "I dislike riding horses, so I decided to take a walk instead. Suddenly, this cat emerged and startled me. I initially thought it was some wild cat and sent someone to catch it. It's a minor matter if I got startled, but if His Majesty were alarmed, that would be serious. Lady said it was your cat."</p><p>Jiang Juan's heart tightened.</p><p>He substituted the cat for Liuhuang, so he pushed the blame onto the Prince, saying it was his cat. However...</p><p>The Prince wasn't there at that time.</p><p>Now that the Prince had arrived, Mei Fei brought up the matter again.</p><p>Usually, Jiang Juan would not have panicked, knowing that the Prince would help him cover up the lie.</p><p>But this time, he had just made the Prince angry, and he himself wasn't sure if he had kept a cat and didn't like fluffy things.</p><p>Jiang Juan became increasingly desperate.</p><p>The Prince might expose his lie right away.</p><p>He suspected that he would be facing death soon.</p><p>"Is this my cat?"</p><p>Xue Fangli repeated, his tone unchanged. "Whose cat is it, then?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>It was over; he knew.</p><p>His eyelashes fluttered a few times, and Jiang Juan sighed. He once again suppressed the urge to look at the Prince and focused on staring at Xiao Li Hua in the basket.</p><p>Mei Fei, being the shrewd person she was, immediately reacted when Xue Fangli asked.</p><p>"Don't you know?" Mei Fei exclaimed. "This cat is not the Four-Eared Divine Cat that Liuhuang won from the racetrack and planned to give to you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond immediately. Pretending to regain his senses, Mei Fei smiled at Jiang Juan and said, "I understand now. Your Highness, perhaps because you love this cat too much and don't want to let me take it away, so you say it's the Prince's. Neither Jun nor I can make a decision without asking the Prince."</p><p>She had originally thought that the cat truly belonged to Xue Fangli. When Princess Mei prodded Jiang Juan into making a decision on her own, she ended up speechless. Now, he had used it as an opportunity.</p><p>—The cat was not Xue Fangli’s at all; his queen merely used him as an excuse.</p><p>It wasn’t a big deal, but taking the bullet for Li Wang was still something he did. Wouldn’t Xue Fangli feel somewhat displeased?</p><p>He wasn’t unhappy, and Princess Mei was delighted.</p><p>She smiled slyly and glanced over, just as she expected—upon hearing this, Xue Fangli stared at his queen. Although there was no significant change in her expression, the look on his face darkened.</p><p>Seeing this, Princess Mei felt immensely relieved.</p><p>“The King thought you didn’t know.”</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Xue Fangli slowly spoke up. He smiled coldly, “First, you said that my queen knows nothing about evil; knowing it was my cat, she still called it a beast. Princess Mei, do you have any intentions towards me?”</p><p>What?</p><p>Princess Mei froze in shock.</p><p>The situation had taken an unexpected turn. She was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>He used her to take the bullet, yet Xue Fangli still protected his queen?</p><p>He wasn’t unhappy at all?</p><p>No matter how surprised or shocked Princess Mei was, she couldn’t bring herself to ask outright. How could she not have any intentions towards Xue Fangli? But now was not the time for confrontations. Princess Mei could only say, “… How could I?”</p><p>“The King often scolds this palace lady for her lack of tact,” Princess Mei smiled, “I truly had no ill intentions; it’s just that I got carried away and have a sharp tongue by nature.”</p><p>After saying this, she frowned and pulled Jiang Juan’s hand, looking sincere as she said, “Do not take my words to heart,”</p><p>Jiang Juan stared blankly without speaking. After all, the Prince's sudden change of mood surprised Mei Fei, let alone Jiang Juan herself who was extremely startled.</p><p>The Prince was still angry with him but was still looking at her.</p><p>The Prince...</p><p>was still scolding, suddenly he was grabbed away. Jiang Juan raised her head; it was the Prince.</p><p>He did not look at Jiang Juan but merely asked a servant for a handkerchief and then held Jiang Juan's wrist, wiping his fingers carefully, not missing a spot as if Jiang Juan had touched something dirty.</p><p>At the same time, Xue Fangli casually said, "This marriage of mine was hastily arranged. Without further ado, this must be Lady Mei Fei’s first time seeing my bride."</p><p>"As an elder, it seems proper to give a gift upon our first meeting."</p><p>His action of wiping Jiang Juan's fingers had initially made Mei Fei feel uncomfortable, but now that he said these words, she held back her irritation and said, "It was indeed this Palace's oversight. I did not prepare anything before coming here."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied coolly, "There is no need to specially prepare. I heard that Lady Mei Fei was born with a jade pendant, which was later carved into plum blossoms, making it quite fresh and endearing. Since my bride likes jade, she will surely like the jade on Lady Mei Fei."</p><p>Mei Fei's face almost cracked at this.</p><p>Born with jade, that was just a rumor, but she did have such a piece of jade—a plum blossom carving made into a pendant, which she had worn since childhood and loved dearly. She often played with it in her free time, and the Emperor Hongxing had given her the name "Mei" as a result.</p><p>Having worn it for so many years, Mei Fei naturally did not want to give away this pendant. She touched her chest unconsciously and struggled to say, "Of course, gifts should be picked carefully, but this jade is not particularly fine. I truly have nothing suitable."</p><p>"If the bride likes jade, there are plenty in my Palace. Once we return, I can choose one for him and send it to Prince Fangli's residence. How about that?"</p><p>"It doesn't matter," Xue Fangli said with a forced smile, "He has seen many fine jades before and is tired of them. It is precisely this jade on Lady Mei Fei that has an unusual history and holds much sentiment."</p><p>With his words, he asked Jiang Juan, "Do you like it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his expression slightly cold. Seeing this, Jiang Juan was taken aback.</p><p>He loved jade, but enough was enough; he did not necessarily have to get it. However, knowing that the Prince was backing him up, Jiang Juan still complied and said, "Mm, a bit strange."</p><p>Hearing his response, Xue Fangli lifted an eyelid and looked back at Princess Mei.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, and the Prince immediately moved his gaze away without hesitation. His cold demeanor made Jiang Juan feel somewhat uncomfortable; he pursed his lips.</p><p>In the end, what Xue Fangli wanted was this pendant. Princess Mei rubbed it through her clothes for a long time before finally figuring out what was happening.</p><p>—What greeting gift? Earlier, she forcibly demanded a four-ear cat, and now Prince Li was retaliating by demanding her pendant.</p><p>It was said that Prince Li had a grudge like an ox; he really did act this way!</p><p>Princess Mei was rather unhappy. She kept touching the jade pendant, but reason told her that it was not yet time to defy Prince Li. It was just a pendant; if he wanted it, she could give it to him. But this pendant was truly Princess Mei's favorite treasure, and she was extremely reluctant to part with it.</p><p>After hesitating for a long time, Princess Mei gritted her teeth and said, "If this palace… does not give it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli took a few steps closer and spoke with regret, "Princess Mei, do you remember what this King said?"</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>He said—</p><p>Don't know death from life.</p><p>Princess Mei's eyelid twitched, "As the leading concubine and holder of the Phoenix Seal, how dare you be so impudent!"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled. "Princess Mei, is that so? Is there anything this King dares not do?"</p><p>His smile was terrifying, like a demon climbing out of an endless abyss, his body even exuding a smell of blood, making one tremble with fear!</p><p>Princess Mei's face was filled with shock and she finally came back to her senses.</p><p>What did you provoke him to do?</p><p>He is a madman, he is a madman!</p><p>There was indeed nothing he dared not do here. He even ate the flesh of his mother concubine!</p><p>"Since Consort Wang likes it, then——"</p><p>Consort Mei took a deep breath and finally removed the pendant.</p><p>It felt like her heart was being cut open. This pendant had always been with her over the years. The moment she took it off, her neck felt empty, devoid of any weight, and she felt unfamiliar.</p><p>"Child, take it."</p><p>Consort Mei almost gritted her teeth as she said each word. She pushed the pendant into Jiang Juan's hand, afraid that if she delayed for a second longer, she might change her mind and be unable to give it away.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked down at it. The pendant was actually quite good quality; the plum blossoms were beautifully carved. He politely said, "Thank you."</p><p>While he was still fiddling with it, a clearly bony hand reached out toward Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan blinked and tentatively offered his own hand to the other person. This time, however, it was Xue Fangli who was startled.</p><p>Stopping his action, Xue Fangli took the pendant from Jiang Juan's heart and gave a glance to the maid.</p><p>Soon enough, someone came forward and carried out the small foxcat from the basket. Xue Fangli tied the pendant around its neck and slowly said, "It should no longer be mistaken for a wild cat."</p><p>"Consort Mei, what do you think?"</p><p>Seeing this, Consort Mei's face almost contorted in anger.</p><p>This pendant had always been carefully worn on her body, fearing that it might break or get damaged, and she could never find another one like it. And now, it was being put on a beast!</p><p>Worse still, this beast had always displeased her, and now her beloved pendant was on its neck, which she could not bear to see!</p><p>Li Wang acted with malicious intent! He deliberately humiliated himself!</p><p>Empress Mei felt as if she could hardly breathe, but the pendant had already been sent out. No matter how unhappy she was, she could only manage a weak smile, "Indeed."</p><p>Xue Fang Li nodded and said coolly, "It quite matches it."</p><p>Quite matches it?</p><p>Just a beast, a contemptible beast, how could it match her pendant?</p><p>Empress Mei was almost choked by anger but this was far from over. She heard Xue Fang Li say, "Empress Mei, after criticizing this king's consort as being of poor character, you claimed to have a sharp tongue and a soft heart, advising him not to take it to heart."</p><p>"You've said your piece, how can he not take it to heart?"</p><p>Xue Fang Li lifted the curtain and said coolly, "Empress Mei, as an elder, if you made a mistake in your words, shouldn't you apologize to him?"</p><p>To demand her pendant, tie it to a cat, and now make her apologize—this was pushing things too far. Empress Mei's face darkened, "You——"</p><p>"Empress Mei," Xue Fang Li said coolly, "If you refuse, this king will only let the emperor decide right or wrong."</p><p>"You first said that this king's consort is inferior to a village fool, and that he doesn't understand good from evil, all because he didn't give you this four-ear cat."</p><p>Hearing this, Empress Mei quickly said, "Wait!"</p><p>No, she couldn't bring it to Huaxing Emperor.</p><p>In front of the Huaxing Emperor, she was pampered more than indulged; not very empathetic, she might have shown some petulance, but she had never displayed her domineering side.</p><p>She could not let the Huaxing Emperor know that she was so domineering in private, absolutely not!</p><p>That position, they two mother and daughter should also vie for it. Now that Xue Chao Hua lacked sincerity, she could only rely on herself.</p><p>She must not lose favor!</p><p>After careful consideration, Consort Mei gritted her teeth and said, "The Prince said it was fine. Once the words are spoken, they cannot be taken back. Just saying 'do not worry' will not soothe one's heart much."</p><p>"Honey, it is my fault," Consort Mei took a deep breath, her smile looking rather forced. "I really am sorry for scolding you like this."</p><p>Jiang Juan shrugged slightly. Although Consort Mei’s words were unpleasant to hear, the Prince had first taken the pendant from her and then apologized to Jiang Juan, so they were even now. She did not hold a grudge against Consort Mei anymore. "Honey, I forgive you."</p><p>If she had been more sensible, Jiang Juan should have replied that Consort Mei was being too harsh on herself. However, by accepting Consort Mei’s apology, Consort Mei felt a pang of anger in her heart.</p><p>She truly hadn’t cursed in vain.</p><p>This Concubine Leaving the Wang Family was truly unfathomable!</p><p>Having lost both the pendant and face, Consort Mei naturally did not stay long. She feared she might lose control of herself and clenched her teeth tightly. Consort Mei smiled and said, "I will continue my walk."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not even give her a glance. Consort Mei turned her head and immediately changed her expression to one filled with resentment.</p><p>One Leaving Wang Family Prince.</p><p>One Leaving Wang Family Concubine.</p><p>And that damned beast.</p><p>She had noted everything that happened today. She would definitely make them pay in the future!</p><p>As Consort Mei left, Xue Congjun stared blankly and said, "Hehe, this is too sweet!"</p><p>Consort Mei was indeed a liar.</p><p>The domineering and arrogant Consort Mei, who had been running rampant in the palace, had been put in her place by his elder brother today.</p><p>However, his fifth brother could treat Mei Fei, while Xue Congyun couldn't do a thing about it. After all, he was known as the living Yama King. Jiang Juan, on the other hand, didn't fall behind when facing Mei Fei; he even choked her twice—</p><p>Oh no, that's not right, add the third one, making it three times in total. Xue Congyun was truly shocked.</p><p>He grabbed Jiang Juan's shoulder, "Brother Juan, you did great! You made her unable to speak. I was actually worried you'd cry from being scared of her."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang, who had been about to remind him, got bumped into by someone and looked down to see Gu Puwang stopping him. Seemingly knowing what Jiang Qingliang was going to say, Gu Puwang shook his head and gave him a look.</p><p>—When will he learn to recognize danger?</p><p>This is too despicable, Jiang Qingliang shut up and joined Gu Puwang in trying to suppress their emotions, squatting by the side to watch the show.</p><p>Just now, it wasn't Jiang Juan's turn to be scared; now it was his. He said slowly, "What are you talking about crying? I'm not that emotional."</p><p>Xue Congyun moved another hand and gestured, "Even such a tiny bug—still a golden cicada—could scare you to tears. You must be really emotional."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Juan ignored him. This was his black history. He said softly, "I shouldn't have been defending you."</p><p>Xue Congyun chuckled. Just now they were just slinging their shoulders together, but now he immediately gave him a bear hug. He sincerely said, "Brother Juan, you're really loyal. You didn't leave me to face her alone. I..."</p><p>Before he could finish, his shoulder was held by someone.</p><p>Xue Congyun thought it was Jiang Qingliang and didn't turn around to look. Extending his hand to pull him down, he asked, "What's going on?"</p><p>Jiang Juan, however, softly shouted, "Prince."</p><p>This word nearly made Xue Congyun faint. His hand trembled, and his entire body almost collapsed. He could only stammer out, "F-Fifth Brother."</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly said, "Grab the other hand."</p><p>Xue Congyun immediately retracted his hand to pull him, but Xue Fangli continued staring at him with a voice devoid of emotion. "The other hand."</p><p>Another one？  </p><p>Another one…  </p><p>Ah, he was resting his head on his Juan ge’s shoulder.  </p><p>Xue Congyun quickly retracted it and hid both behind her back, saying in a servile tone, "I’ve taken them back, Fifth Brother, I really have."  </p><p>He was still somewhat puzzled in his heart.  </p><p>His Fifth Brother always bullied Juan ge; the two of them should not have any feelings for each other—knowing that he would stick up for Juan ge was one thing, but how could he allow anyone to bully his own concubine? Why then did he not even let him rest his head on Juan ge’s shoulder?  </p><p>Xue Congyun was still puzzled when she heard Xue Fangli ask, "Have you pulled all the fur off the carpets?"  </p><p>Xue Congyun: "…"  </p><p>She replied in a guilty tone, "Of course not yet."  </p><p>"Since you have time to race horses, it must be quite easy," Xue Fangli said with a faint smile, "So, go ahead and pull all the carpets clean in the tent."  </p><p>Xue Congyun: "…"  </p><p>There were only ten or so carpets.  </p><p>What was wrong with him? What had he done? Why was he being punished further?  </p><p>Xue Congyun felt utterly lost and extremely distressed, almost to the point of wanting to die.  </p><p>"And you,"  </p><p>The tone changed as Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan, his expression calm, "Why are you running?"</p><p>He still spoke in a cold tone, and Jiang Juan slowly replied, "I just came to see the cat."</p><p>"Does your leg hurt anymore?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was calm. "The Emperor gave this prince a bottle of ointment; your abrasions can be treated with it. After you finish seeing the cat, go back and apply it yourself."</p><p>With that, Xue Fangli took a step forward and walked away without even glancing at Jiang Juan. Usually, he would personally apply the medicine to her, but Jiang Juan couldn't help calling out, "Prince..."</p><p>Xue Fangli stopped in his tracks but didn't turn around. "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan remained silent. It was obvious that the prince was still angry, and he didn't know what to say. Thinking hard, Jiang Juan not only lacked ideas but also found himself remembering Gu Puwang's words: tell the prince to be a little spoiled.</p><p>But how could he do that?</p><p>He really couldn't be spoiled.</p><p>Jiang Juan had been quiet for too long, and Xue Fangli waited patiently, but Jiang Juan never spoke. Eventually, Xue Fangli lifted his foot with a grim expression.</p><p>But in the next moment, after a slight tremor, his sleeve was pulled by someone.</p><p>Apart from Jiang Juan, no one else would do such a thing.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, his breath cold. "Stopping this prince without saying anything... you..."</p><p>"Husband."</p><p>It was a soft and light voice. Jiang Juan didn't know why, but he suddenly used that title—The Prince always made him use it, but Jiang Juan had never been able to say it.</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan finally called out the word. He lowered his eyelashes and slowly said, "Husband, please don't be angry anymore, okay?"</p>
