						<p>"Shǐ shén?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said indifferently. Jiang Juan could not talk about the plot with him, so she only said in a wistful tone, "I feel... I won't live for too long."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, "Uncomfortable again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded randomly, and Xue Fangli paused, his hand almost brushing away Jiang Juan's, but he eventually let her hold onto his sleeve.</p><p>They got into the carriage, and there was no word between them.</p><p>Such peaceful moments were not uncommon in the past; usually Jiang Juan would be sleeping. But if she wasn't asleep, she would still talk about trivial things with the Prince. However, now Jiang Juan seemed to have no mood at all.</p><p>He originally intended to be cautious like a salted fish, but he ended up taking over both the submissive and dominant roles of the main characters.</p><p>Especially the submissive role. Every time Jiang Juan was sleeping, she had no idea what happened, and when she woke up, she would already be jumping on the face of the submissive character.</p><p>So unfair, how unfair it was to her.</p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Juan said sadly, "Prince, I want to change my name. From now on, I will be called Jiang Bujuan."</p><p>As the name suggested, she was both lazy and tired, sleeping endlessly without end. She couldn't sleep anymore and didn't want to accumulate more resentment.</p><p>Jiang Juan got so lost in thought that she didn't notice Xue Fangli staring at her the entire time, nor did she pay attention to his expression.</p><p>Dark and vicious.</p><p>He was displeased.</p><p>Displeased that Jiang Juan made him draw.</p><p>Even more displeased that Jiang Juan said she wouldn't live for too long.</p><p>A dark emotion was fermenting deep within Xue Fangli's heart, and he detested this situation beyond his control.</p><p>He had known all along that the youth would not live long.</p><p>Whether the youth chose to draw or not should have been none of his concern.</p><p>But in his heart, those desires and unfulfilled ambitions never ceased to clamor.</p><p>He did not want the youth to see others, nor did he wish for him to be watched by others.</p><p>The youth's eyes should only contain him. He wanted the youth to gaze at him entirely, focusing and earnestly.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly.</p><p>What was there to argue about with the youth when he knew he would not live long?</p><p>It was his own desires that were too deep and intense, his cravings too many, it was also because of him—</p><p>He could not restrain himself.</p><p>Having left the mansion, Jiang Juan returned to his courtyard.</p><p>On the way back, he swore resolutely that he would no longer sleep, but ended up falling asleep somewhere, only to collapse onto his bed a short while later, defeated once again by laziness.</p><p>When the high official came over, Jiang Juan was playing with a jade nine-linked ring. This had been found among several boxes of gifts from Orchid Pavilion and given to him as entertainment.</p><p>"Madame."</p><p>The high official held a bowl of medicine, smiling, "It's time for your medication."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>At this moment, he recalled the fear of being controlled by traditional Chinese medicine. Jiang Juan slowly said, "What drug did you give me? I'm fine, I don't need any medication."</p><p>"The imperial physician prescribed several doses of tonics for Your Excellency," said the high official in charge, "The kitchen just finished boiling them, please drink while they're hot."</p><p>"Put it down first," Jiang Juan thought of a way to refuse, "It's too hot, I'll drink it later."</p><p>The high official shook his head, "That won't do. His Excellency Wang asked me to make sure you finish it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He lowered his head and felt numb even before drinking the medicine. The high official remembered something upon seeing this and hurriedly took out a small bag, "I almost forgot, His Excellency Wang also instructed me to prepare some candied fruits for you."</p><p>With such thorough preparation, Jiang Juan still didn't feel like drinking it. He ate a piece of candy and asked the high official, "What is Your Excellency Wang doing?"</p><p>The high official replied, "His Excellency Wang ——"</p><p>Since returning to the manor, His Excellency Wang's mood had been low, his face sullen and gloomy. However, High Official Gao was used to his unpredictable moods and didn't mind too much as long as he didn't provoke him.</p><p>"He is resting."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "oh," "Fetch me something, and I'll drink the medicine."</p><p>The high official asked, "What do you need?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered a sentence, and the high official hesitated, "Should I first ask His Excellency's opinion?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Alright, go ask him."</p><p>The high official rushed back to Cool Wind Courtyard. Xue Fangli heard the commotion and lightly tapped his fingers without lifting his head, asking, "Did he drink the medicine?"</p><p>The high official hesitated before answering, "The Empress Consort hasn't drunk it yet."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him sideways, his expression cold, "You didn't take the medicine, so what are you going to do?"</p><p>Gao Jing Shi could only truthfully report, "The Concubine said that taking the medicine was fine too, but he wants the Prince's painting."</p><p>His fingers paused on the small table as Xue Fangli frowned, "The Prince's painting?"</p><p>Gao Jing Shi nodded, "The Concubine said that when the Prince returned, he brought back a painting, and he wants this one."</p><p>Xue Fangli was stunned.</p><p>In Zhonghua Palace, he had taken out eight paintings in total. Seven of them were thrown to Wang Zongguan, who was instructed to deliver them to Emperor Hongxing. He kept only this one, which was too damaged to be unfolded anymore.</p><p>It wasn't worth anything anyway.</p><p>"Why does he want this painting?"</p><p>"This... the Concubine didn't say."</p><p>Gao Jing Shi shook his head, unsure about the matter. Xue Fangli did not speak further and merely lowered his eyelids, looking thoughtful.</p><p>In the silence of the room, Gao Jing Shi hesitated, "Prince, if it's not possible, I will report to the Concubine immediately."</p><p>Xue Fangli made no response, only unfolding the portrait on the side.</p><p>With just a few strokes, the figure in the painting captured both form and spirit.</p><p>Under the shade of a plum blossom tree, a youth sat on a couch with long hair cascading down his shoulders. A few petals fell onto his lap.</p><p>His fingertips slowly caressed downward. Xue Fangli knew that if he parted the long hair piled on his shoulder, there would be a red mole on the youth's neck, darker than the plum blossoms' hue.</p><p>Yang Liusheng was truly deserving of the title of Brush Saint.</p><p>If he had not taken it away, if this painting had spread—</p><p>The most beautiful in the world.</p><p>It would have drawn countless covetous glances.</p><p>Dissatisfaction rose again, and he crumpled the scroll a little. Sch Fanli's expression was cold and startled. After a while, he slowly said, "That painting, give it to him."</p><p>High Manager was stunned, knowing that the painting might not be so simple. After all, the Prince responded to everything his Consort asked for; such a long silence from the Prince indicated that the painting was quite special to him. However—</p><p>Nothing could surpass the position of his Consort in his heart.</p><p>Just as High Manager was about to respond, a guard requested an audience. He said with a somewhat peculiar expression, "Prince..."</p><p>"The medicine that Manager served just now was poured out of the window by the Consort."</p><p>Sch Fanli: "..."</p><p>High Manager: "..."</p><p>This was the reason for the painting?</p><p>So he sent him away and then poured out the medicine?</p><p>He was speechless for a long time. High Manager asked Sch Fanli, "Prince, are you still going to give that painting to the Consort?"</p><p>Sch Fanli laughed and naturally understood, but still said lazily, "Give it to him."</p><p>High Manager nodded and had barely taken a few steps when he heard Sch Fanli say again, "Watch closely; he fears bitterness."</p><p>He watched even more carefully, but the Consort was willing to drink it herself. High Manager asked with a bitter face, "Prince, if the Consort still refuses to drink it, what should your servant do?"</p><p>"Shall I call you over?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Let's see."</p><p>He was still holding a grudge against him.</p><p>Not long after, Gao Guanshi carried a small box, inside of which were scrolls.</p><p>"Lady Wang, the painting you requested."</p><p>Jiang Juan also showed him an empty bowl and confidently said, "I drank all the medicine."</p><p>Gao Guanshi: "..."</p><p>The embarrassment now shifted to Jiang Juan.</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>Jiang Juan had already told Lanting about the scrolls. As soon as she received the box, she was about to leave but thought of something and turned back to ask Jiang Juan, "Young Master, you should have watched the fireworks before coming home today."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked her, "Which fireworks?"</p><p>Gao Guanshi knew about this matter and said, "The Emperor toured the garden today and seemed quite happy. Thinking that it would be more enjoyable for everyone, he ordered fireworks to be set off in the evening."</p><p>There were even fireworks; Jiang Juan was intrigued.</p><p>The bowl of medicine could be discarded and another pot brewed. Gao Guanshi went to supervise the kitchen staff brewing the medicine, while Jiang Juan decided to find the Young Master to accompany him in watching the fireworks.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never been to the Liangfeng Pavilion before and did not know the way, but there were maidservants everywhere who could direct him. He soon found his destination.</p><p>"Prince."</p><p>Jiang Juan knocked on the door, knocking for a while before there was any movement. A cold voice transmitted through, "What is it?"</p><p>He pushed the door open and said excitedly, "Prince, let's go watch the fireworks."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him; the young man's expression was joyful, his eyes sparkling with excitement, making it hard to say no.</p><p>In fact, regardless of the reason, he had almost never refused the youth's requests.</p><p>"Did you take your medicine?"</p><p>Without answering, Xue Fangli only asked this sentence.</p><p>Jiang Juan said sincerely, "...Let's talk about something else."</p><p>Seeing that he hadn't taken it, Xue Fangli said matter-of-factly, "Take your medicine, then you can watch the fireworks."</p><p>Jiang Juan complained, "But it tastes so bitter."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "There are sweet candies."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "That's bitter too, I can't drink it."</p><p>"Don't be a baby."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Saying the medicine tasted bitter also counted as being a baby. Jiang Juan felt that the Prince sometimes wasn't reasonable and said gloomily, "I didn't take it."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and gave some instructions to the maid. Soon enough, the medicine bowl was passed over, Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan, "Do you want to drink it yourself or should I force-feed it to you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was shocked as she looked at him, "Force-feed?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his chin slightly, and a guard stepped forward. He glanced down at Jiang Juan, "Choose then."</p><p>Jiang Juan regretted inviting the prince to watch the fireworks; if only he had run away on his own, he wouldn't have to face the pain of taking medicine.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Can't choose?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I'll take it myself."</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed deeply, lifted the medicine bowl, and sniffed it. The taste was truly disgusting, so he put it down again. "Prince, I don't want to drink it."</p><p>He always refused to admit that he was being a brat, but with such a soft tone, how could this not be considered brattiness?</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan. He could have easily held him in his arms and coaxed him into drinking it, but he didn't really want to.</p><p>The youth was always so naively unaware.</p><p>The youth was always so carefree.</p><p>His irritability, his rebelliousness—no matter how much he tried to suppress them or how they surged up again—he remained blissfully unaware from the start. He even approached voluntarily and returned an innocent gaze.</p><p>How hateful.</p><p>Xue Fangli said slowly, "Then let them force-feed you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. A guard obeyed and told Jiang Juan, "Your Highness, I apologize for this."</p><p>They moved towards Jiang Juan. No matter what happened, Jiang Juan didn't want to be forced-fed; it would be too humiliating. He resisted fiercely, "Prince…"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him completely, only lowering his eyelids without saying another word.</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan was completely silent.</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't want to bother with it anymore or watch any longer, but the silence was too overwhelming—there wasn't a sound to be heard.</p><p>The boy was so spoiled and afraid of hardship; whether he pouted or complained, he would always make noise. It shouldn't be this quiet.</p><p>Frowning, Xue Fangli looked down at him from below.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat on the ground, as if in pain from the fall. He lowered his head to examine his knee, not making a single sound.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared blankly for a long time.</p><p>How could he let himself get hurt just by looking away?</p><p>Why did he care so much? In the end, he remained ignorant, yet Xue Fangli's heart softened first.</p><p>Xue Fangli stood up and took slow steps towards Jiang Juan. He lifted Jiang Juan's chin and looked down at him, asking, "Do you only stop hurting yourself when you're placed on a Buddhist altar?"</p>
