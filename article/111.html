						<p>"Why are you running so fast?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's face remained expressionless, and his demeanor was very calm.</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Are you too slow?"</p><p>He turned the tables on her, and Xue Fangli, upon hearing this, did not say anything but merely shot him a faint smile.</p><p>When Lan Ting saw Xue Fangli, he hurriedly greeted him, "This slave has seen His Majesty."</p><p>Bai Xuechao, who was originally lying in bed, struggled to get up to pay his respects. Upon seeing this, Jiang Juan grabbed him by the arm, "Grandfather, what are you doing?"</p><p>Bai Xuechao glanced at Xue Fangli. Jiang Juan turned her head as if she had understood something. Before Xue Fangli could say anything, she said, "Grandfather, it's unnecessary; you're still sick."</p><p>"Good grandson."</p><p>Bai Xuechao shook his head at her and gave him a hint, but this time Jiang Juan did not understand the gesture. She asked in confusion, "Grandfather, what is it?"</p><p>Bai Xuechao: "..."</p><p>It was hard to say directly, so Bai Xuechao could only stammer, "Nothing, nothing."</p><p>But his appearance truly did not look like he had nothing on his mind, which made Jiang Juan even more puzzled. Since Bai Xuechao refused to speak, she could only look at Xue Fangli for help, feeling that he must know what was going on.</p><p>"Mr. Bai need not bow so much."</p><p>Meeting Jiang Juan's gaze, Xue Fangli smiled slightly, looking quite pleased. "The Empress Dowager's words are my wishes."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not understand Bai Xuechao's hint, but Xue Fangli knew his intention; he was merely afraid that Jiang Juan would make him unhappy by stopping him from bowing. He silently advised her not to interfere with his paying respects.</p><p>Once Xue Fangli spoke, Bai Xuechao no longer needed to get out of bed. Bowing, he said, "Thank Your Majesty."</p><p>"Why are you running so fast?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression remained unchanged, and his demeanor was very calm.</p><p>Jiang Juan remarked, "Are you too slow?"</p><p>He turned the tables on her, but Xue Fangli did not respond with words. Instead, he gave Jiang Juan a faint smile.</p><p>Lan Ting, seeing Xue Fangli, hurriedly greeted him: "This slave has seen His Majesty."</p><p>Bai Xuechao, who was lying in bed, struggled to get up and bow. Seeing this, Jiang Juan grabbed his arm and asked, "Grandfather, what are you doing?"</p><p>Bai Xuechao glanced at Xue Fangli. Jiang Juan turned her head as if she had understood something.

"The Empress Dowager's words are my wishes."</p><p>Jiang Juan had failed to understand Bai Xuechao's hint, but Xue Fangli knew his intention: he was afraid that Jiang Juan would make him unhappy by stopping him from bowing. He silently advised her not to interfere with his paying respects.</p><p>Once Xue Fangli spoke, Bai Xuechao no longer needed to get out of bed. Bowing, he said, "Thank Your Majesty."</p><p>"Why are you running so fast?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression remained unchanged, and his demeanor was serene.</p><p>Jiang Juan remarked, "Are you too slow?"</p><p>He turned the tables on her with a wry smile, but Xue Fangli did not respond further.</p><p>Lan Ting, seeing Xue Fangli, hurriedly greeted him: "This slave has seen His Majesty."</p><p>Bai Xuechao, who was lying in bed, struggled to get up and bow. Seeing this, Jiang Juan grabbed his arm and asked, "Grandfather, what are you doing?"</p><p>Bai Xuechao glanced at Xue Fangli. Jiang Juan turned her head, seeming to have understood something.

He silently advised her not to interfere with his paying respects.</p><p>Once Xue Fangli spoke, Bai Xuechao no longer needed to get out of bed. Bowing, he said, "Thank Your Majesty."</p><p>Mr. Bai, do you know why I became this emperor?</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xue Fangli suddenly asked Bai Xuechao this question.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Bai Xuechao was stunned and did not know how to respond for a moment.</p><p>Ascending to a high position is merely for power and status, but this new emperor did not show any ambition on his part. He even seemed indifferent to the position, as if becoming emperor was something he could do or not do without much regret.</p><p>"For some time, I often puzzled over one thing," Xue Fangli said indifferently, "I don't know what my empress is always afraid of."</p><p>"He's afraid when taken to the Princess Chang's residence, and he's also afraid when taken to the imperial stables. He seems to be afraid of everything."</p><p>Xue Fangli continued, "Though I say he has a small heart, it's not that small. But he fears all sorts of strange people; after being reassured too much, I grew tired of consoling him. Since being a concubine made him live in constant fear, let him be an empress."</p><p>Hearing this, Bai Xuechao was stunned.</p><p>Bai Xuechao knew very well what Xue Fangli's intentions were when he said these words.</p><p>In fact, over the past few days, Jiang Juan had been unconscious, and Bai Xuechao had been extremely anxious. Xue Fangli had nearly gone mad, which Bai Xuechao had not failed to notice.</p><p>Just by ordering people to destroy temples and kidnap many monks, he had already incurred much criticism. If this had happened in the past, even Bai Xuechao would have frowned and called it absurd.</p><p>But since this was about Jiang Juan.</p><p>Bai Xuechao was not yet senile and knew that this new emperor was doing these things for his granddaughter.</p><p>However, despite this, as an elder, Bai Xuechao could not help but worry about Jiang Juan.</p><p>This was also the reason why, when Jiang Juan stopped him from bowing earlier, Bai Xuechao waited for Xue Fangli to give instructions before stopping his struggles and movements.</p><p>In the past, Jiang Juan was kept by Snow White Morning by his side. Snow White Morning had never thought about what would happen to Jiang Juan in the future; he only wished that this grandson of his would not be too outstanding, just living as an ordinary person, safe and happy. Therefore, he did not teach Jiang Juan many things.</p><p>However, now Snow White Morning began to feel some regret.</p><p>Jiang Juan knew nothing about it. If Xue Fangli was willing to indulge him now, what about the future?</p><p>If Jiang Juan had not been there, Snow White Morning would have many words to say to Xue Fangli.</p><p>For example, this grandson of his had never had ill intentions; if he did something wrong in the future, he should communicate with Jiang Juan properly instead of losing his temper and being patient with him.</p><p>For example, if Jiang Juan caused him displeasure, it was not because Jiang Juan meant to do so; he just really did not understand. He should not blame him.</p><p>However, now Xue Fangli said that he took this position for Jiang Juan.</p><p>Snow White Morning moved his lips but did not know what to say. Xue Fangli then calmly said, "Mr. Bai is getting old. Since he has come to the capital, he might as well stay."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan and added, "He can worry about you a little less. Moreover... in the future if I anger him again, there will be a place for me to go, and someone will stand up for me."</p><p>"Mr. Bai staying in the capital can also see whether my treatment of him is temporary or lifelong."</p><p>Snow White Morning expressed all his concerns completely, which also provided him with a solution.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not notice the turbulent undercurrents between them; he only heard Xue Fangli saying that Snow White Morning should stay and thought it was a good idea. Jiang Juan asked eagerly, "Grandfather, will you stay in the capital?"</p><p>Snow White Morning looked at Jiang Juan with a gentle smile, "Do you want Grandfather to stay?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Of course I do. With you here, I can spend more time with you. If you go back, we can only meet a few times a year, and I don't want that."</p><p>Snow White Morning stared at Jiang Juan for a while before saying affectionately, "Alright, since my grandson wants me to stay, I will stay."</p><p>Staying would be good; he could spend more time with Feiyue. He also had many old friends in the capital who he could visit from time to time. Living in seclusion in the mountains was nice, but staying in the capital and accompanying his grandson would naturally be enjoyable.</p><p>Jiang Juan listened and her eyes shone brightly, "Good!"</p><p>Bai Xue Chao patted his hand, seeing Jiang Juan's eyes crinkling in a smile, she couldn't help but laugh along too, "Where is my grandson going? Your grandfather will accompany you."</p><p>When Jiang Juan came to visit Bai Xue Chao, he unexpectedly brought an unexpected delight; Bai Xue Chao would also stay in the capital. He was so happy about it.</p><p>However, Bai Xue Chao was indeed old and had just recovered from a serious illness. After talking for such a long time, they were somewhat tired, so Jiang Juan didn't continue to talk with him but instead said goodbye and let Bai Xue Chao rest.</p><p>Regarding Bai Xue Chao's condition, after asking Lanting and receiving the reply that there was no longer any major concern, she finally returned to the sedan chair with Xue Fangli.</p><p>"Return to the palace?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. The sedan chair was lifted, but they hadn't gone far when someone chased after them.</p><p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p>"The Empress——!"</p><p>The sedan chair was set down, and Gao Zongguan finally caught up. He leaned against the wall beside them, speaking in short gasps, "Emperor, Empress, this is what you wanted to eat last time..."</p><p>"Ice cream to eat."</p><p>However, at that time, by sheer bad luck, just as Gao Chengshi went to prepare it, someone reported that Emperor Hongxing was seriously ill. Jiang Juan had to immediately leave with Xue Fangli to go to the palace and didn't get to have the ice cream.</p><p>Jiang Juan took the bowl and thanked Gao Chengshi, "Thank you."</p><p>Now moving on to the next phase, I will provide a deep copy edit of the translation.</p><p>Jiang Juan listened intently, her eyes sparkling brightly. "Good!"</p><p>Bai Xue Chao patted his hand, and seeing Jiang Juan's eyes crinkle in a smile, she couldn't help but laugh along too. "Where is my grandson going? Your grandfather will accompany you."</p><p>When Jiang Juan came to visit Bai Xue Chao, she was unexpectedly delighted to find that he would also stay in the capital. She was overjoyed.</p><p>However, Bai Xue Chao was indeed quite old and had just recovered from a serious illness. After talking for so long, they were somewhat tired, so Jiang Juan didn't continue to talk with him but instead said goodbye and let him rest.</p><p>Regarding Bai Xue Chao's condition, after asking Lanting and receiving the reply that there was no longer any major concern, she finally returned to the sedan chair with Xue Fangli.</p><p>"Return to the palace?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. The sedan chair was lifted, but they hadn't gone far when someone chased after them.</p><p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p>"The Empress——!"</p><p>The sedan chair was set down, and Gao Zongguan finally caught up. He leaned against the wall beside them, speaking in short gasps, "Emperor, Empress, this is what you wanted to eat last time..."</p><p>"Ice cream to eat."</p><p>However, at that time, by sheer bad luck, just as Gao Chengshi went to prepare it, someone reported that Emperor Hongxing was seriously ill. Jiang Juan had to immediately leave with Xue Fangli to go to the palace and didn't get to have the ice cream.</p><p>Jiang Juan took the bowl and thanked Gao Chengshi, "Thank you."</p><p>Now moving on to the final phase of text polishing by the writing expert.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan's eyes lit up. "Good!"</p><p>Bai Xue Chao patted his hand, a warm smile curling at the corners of her mouth as she laughed along. "Where is my grandson going? Your grandfather will accompany you."</p><p>When Jiang Juan visited Bai Xue Chao, she was delighted to learn that he would remain in the capital. Her happiness knew no bounds.</p><p>However, Bai Xue Chao, being quite elderly and having just recovered from a serious illness, felt somewhat fatigued after their lengthy conversation. Thus, Jiang Juan said her goodbyes and let him rest.</p><p>Inquiring about Bai Xue Chao's condition from Lanting, she received the reassuring news that he was no longer in any danger. With this, Jiang Juan returned to the sedan chair alongside Xue Fangli.</p><p>"Return to the palace?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded as the sedan began its journey. However, they hadn't gone far when a voice called out from behind them.</p><p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p>"The Empress——!"</p><p>The sedan chair was lowered, and Gao Zongguan finally caught up. Panting heavily, he leaned against the wall beside them, gasping for words. "Emperor, Empress, this is what you wished to eat last time..."</p><p>"Ice cream."</p><p>However, fate seemed to have other plans. Just as Gao Chengshi prepared the treat, news arrived that Emperor Hongxing was gravely ill. Urgently leaving for the palace with Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan missed out on enjoying her ice cream.</p><p>Jiang Juan gratefully accepted the bowl and thanked Gao Chengshi, "Thank you."</p><p>He Manager smiled, "Not much. Queen, please taste it quickly."</p><p>Jiang Juan took a small bite. The rich dairy flavor was smooth and cold, melting in her mouth immediately. Mint had been added, making it refreshing and very cooling.</p><p>Just one bite, Jiang Juan fell in love with the ice cream's taste. She sighed, "It’s delicious."</p><p>Seeing this, He Manager was quite pleased and said, "I traveled all over the capital city to finally find this recipe. I instructed the kitchen to prepare it for you, Queen. It makes me happy that you like it."</p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing, "Since the Queen likes it, I will take the recipe back to Lanting when I return. When she comes back to the palace, I can bring it with her as well."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "Alright."</p><p>But after saying this, she realized something and asked He Manager, "Aren’t you coming into the palace with us?"</p><p>He Manager whispered softly, "Queen, I have another love interest."</p><p>Jiang Juan finally understood, but this was also fine. She nodded, "Thank you for your hard work."</p><p>"It’s nothing, nothing," He Manager waved his hand. Looking at the sky, he hurriedly added, "The sun will set soon. Queen and His Majesty, please return to the palace quickly and don’t linger on the way."</p><p>"Alright, let’s go."</p><p>Jiang Juan waved goodbye to him. The sedan chair was lifted again by people, and He Manager bowed with a broad smile, standing in place to watch them leave.</p><p>As she watched, Jiang Juan suddenly felt a little reluctant to leave.</p><p>Also, at this moment, Jiang Juan finally had a tangible understanding of Xue Fangli's current identity.</p><p>"You've become the Emperor, not the Prince anymore," Jiang Juan muttered.</p><p>Xue Fangli shrugged indifferently, "It's fine if you don't want to change your words."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. Although he was more accustomed to calling him the Prince, he decided to gradually make the switch, though with some regret.</p><p>"That day of the coronation ceremony, I unfortunately fainted and didn't see it through to the end."</p><p>"There's nothing much to be sorry about."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "For the next big event, don't faint again."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked blankly, "Ah? What other big events are there?"</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed nonchalant as he replied, "I mentioned last time that our wedding was too rushed. Let's do it again. I already ordered preparations for it when organizing the coronation ceremony."</p><p>At this point, Xue Fangli smiled slightly, lifted Jiang Juan's face, and spoke in a deep, seductive voice, "This time, you will wear the wedding gown for me, and we will drink the combined wine together."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked and after a while, he asked Xue Fangli, "After getting out of the sedan chair, you carried me all the way, and then you coughed up blood. Your body is so weak, can you carry me?"</p><p>"And also," Jiang Juan said with concern, "Getting married involves many things. Can your strength withstand it? Are you capable?"</p><p>"Will it be you fainting this time?"</p>
