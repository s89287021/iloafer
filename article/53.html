						<p>Now, no matter how delicious the wisteria cake was, Jiang Juan couldn't eat it.</p><p>"Where is Your Highness?"</p><p>Just as he feared, Jiang Juan was extremely worried. He frowned and asked, "Is anything wrong?"</p><p>The steward didn't say anything; instead, he said, "Your Highness, please follow me."</p><p>It was still raining. Jiang Juan took a few steps, and Lan Ting hurriedly opened an umbrella to catch up with him. The steward secretly glanced at him from behind, feeling extremely guilty.</p><p>Sigh, he couldn't do anything about it either.</p><p>It was true that Your Highness hadn't slept and had gone early to buy wisteria cake for the Empress. But he had always been unable to fall asleep.</p><p>As for catching a chill and starting to cough up blood again, that was all lies. The King was just making an excuse to win the Empress's sympathy.</p><p>The steward knew the truth but couldn't say it out loud. After all, this argument between the Empress and the King was all his fault for being too talkative.</p><p>He could only preserve his life thanks to the Empress. As long as the Empress didn't calm down, he had to live in constant fear. After all, if the King was unhappy, he might be punished.</p><p>What could the steward do?</p><p>He cursed the King inwardly while obediently helping the King persuade the Empress back.</p><p>They arrived at Lingfeng Courtyard. Servants were coming and going, holding golden basins filled with water. The handkerchiefs in their hands were stained with a faint trace of blood. Jiang Juan saw this and became even more worried.</p><p>"… Your Highness."</p><p>He hurried inside. The man was lying on the bed, looking over at him with sideways glances.</p><p>Xue Fangli often wore dark robes that were expansive and intricate, but today he had changed into light-colored clothing. His expression was weary, slightly sickly. His originally beautiful appearance seemed somewhat elegant in this moment.</p><p>"How did you come here?"</p><p>Seeing the situation, Xue Fangli's gaze swept over, finally landing on the steward. He said in a cold tone, "This king has done as I was instructed."</p><p>Steward: "..."</p><p>He winced and said, "Servant, servant—"</p><p>"Your Majesty, don't blame him; it was me who asked all along."</p><p>Jiang Juan was afraid that the steward would be blamed for her sake and hurriedly spoke up for him. The steward shamefully lowered his head, sighing inwardly.</p><p>Ah, how kind Consort Wang is, he doesn't deserve this treatment.</p><p>The king also, taking advantage of Consort Wang's kindness, deceives him every day; that's not humane at all.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked worriedly, "Your Majesty, are you okay?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied in a matter-of-fact tone, "This king is fine."</p><p>His complexion was pale, and his expression was listless, clearly not in good condition. Jiang Juan asked again, "Has the imperial physician come to see him?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Let this king rest for a few days."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Oh," but he couldn't put his mind at ease. Before he could say anything more, Xue Fangli, seemingly uninterested, asked, "Did you try the wisteria cake?"</p><p>"Do you like it?"</p><p>The king had coughed up blood due to the wisteria cake but still asked if he liked it. Jiang Juan slowly shook his head, "I don't like it."</p><p>Hearing that he didn't like it, Xue Fangli showed no reaction, only saying calmly, "If you don't like it, it's fine. I'll give you something else next time."</p><p>Jiang Juan zhenzeng, "Wang Ye..."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Hmm?"</p><p>Yesterday, Wang Ye lied to me, and Jiang Juan was really a bit angry. But now, she is truly moved. She lowered her eyelashes and sighed softly, "I deceived you."</p><p>"I like vinegary pancakes, but..."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "You're not feeling well. Next time, don't go out in the rain to buy vinegary pancakes anymore."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him a few times and realized that Jiang Juan was pacified by his words. He laughed lightly and agreed, "Alright, this Wang listens to you."</p><p>After saying that, Xue Fangli waved his hand and dismissed all his attendants. Then he said to Jiang Juan again, "Come and sleep with me tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan had originally planned to go back to bed, and she didn't want to argue anymore. She took off her shoes and socks, intending to crawl onto the inner side of the bed, but as soon as her knees were placed on it, a hand fell across her waist, causing her to suddenly fall into the warmth.</p><p>Jiang Juan bumped against him; he didn't yell in pain this time, but instead asked anxiously, "Wang Ye, are you alright?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, resting his chin on Jiang Juan's head. He sniffed the scent emanating from her body, greedily inhaling her fragrance, and spoke in a low, hoarse voice, "Of course not."</p><p>The scent of her body could miraculously soothe his agitation and brutality; it even alleviated the headache that had plagued him for so long.</p><p>For the past few nights, Xue Fangli had desperately wanted to hold her again and had deeply missed the fragrance that belonged to her.</p><p>At this moment, his arms were finally filled with her again.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>She was startled and quickly tried to sit up, but the hand on her body seemed as if it didn't want to let go of her. Jiang Juan asked anxiously, "Did I hurt you?"</p><p>The faint sweetness lingered in their breaths. Xue Fangli closed his eyes leisurely and replied with pleasure, "Do you think this Wang is like you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan froze for a moment before realizing that the Prince was teasing her for being afraid of pain. Jiang Juan lifted her head to look at him for a while, but finally laid back down on his body and muttered, "If it doesn't hurt, then fine."</p><p>——Considering the Prince's illness, she could let go of her grievances as a salty fish.</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed softly, raised his hand, and touched Jiang Juan's nape hesitantly.</p><p>Rain pattered outside the window while the room was filled with a serene silence. Jiang Juan lay in Xue Fangli's arms, almost drifting into sleep, but just before losing consciousness, she suddenly remembered something and grabbed Xue Fangli's sleeve again, "Prince."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and asked, "What is it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan murmured, "I almost forgot the most important thing."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at her as Jiang Juan said seriously, "Please don't lie to me anymore, okay?"</p><p>"… I really don't like being deceived."</p><p>By saying this, he meant that he would let go of the jade pendant incident and wanted Xue Fangli to promise not to deceive him again. However, Xue Fangli didn't immediately reply but casually asked, "Have you ever lied to this prince before?"</p><p>The words "no" almost slipped out of her mouth. Jiang Juan suddenly remembered that she had also been deceiving the Prince with her heart condition.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, Jiang Juan patched it up by saying, "Lies told under compulsion are acceptable, but nothing else…"</p><p>Heart condition was part of her character setting; she didn't use it often and only occasionally acted when she wanted to rest. </p><p>It shouldn't be that big of a deal?</p><p>After all, the Prince's days were numbered. Once he passed away, the matter of her heart condition would be over.</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to reassure herself but still felt somewhat guilty. She buried her face in Xue Fangli's shoulder, and Xue Fangli glanced at her but didn't seem too concerned.</p><p>Jiang Juan's lies were just some harmless banter with him, and—</p><p>There were two things that he tricked Shǎo completely.</p><p>Jiāng Juàn Wù thought he coughed up blood. As Shǎo's heart condition worsened, he might not last long, and coughing up blood was nothing to fear.</p><p>Apart from this, the thing he fooled Shǎo most about was something else.</p><p>Shǎo thought he was a good person.</p><p>He also tried his best to play the role of a good person.</p><p>Xue Fàlí sighed softly, slowly lowering his eyelids.</p><p>If he revealed his true face, would Jiāng Juàn Wù be afraid?</p><p>Would he still want to get close to him?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Fàlí closed his eyes lightly, his heart filled with some irritability, and a hint of gloom appeared on his expression.</p><p>Palace of Nourishing the Heart.</p><p>"Announcing —— Colonel Su Feiyu."</p><p>Manager Wāng called out in a sharp voice. Soon, someone walked in slowly, and Su Feiyu bowed politely, "Subject —— Su Feiyu pays homage to His Majesty."</p><p>Emperor Hongxīng sat calmly beside him, looking at his bow without much emotion, not issuing an order for him to rise. However, Su Feiyu did not show the slightest discomfort, remaining calm and composed as he knelt there, allowing Emperor Hongxīng to examine him.</p><p>"So many years have passed, you haven't changed much."</p><p>After a long silence, Emperor Hongxīng said these words before waving his hand, "Stand up."</p><p>Su Feiyu stood up. He had already passed the age of forty, but he did not look old on his face. Su Feiyu smiled and said, "His Majesty is still as magnificent and martial as ever."</p><p>There were two things that he tricked Shǎo completely.</p><p>Jiāng Juàn Wù thought he was coughing up blood. As Shǎo's heart condition worsened, he might not last long, and coughing up blood was nothing to fear.</p><p>Apart from this, the thing he fooled Shǎo most about was something else.</p><p>Shǎo thought he was a good person.</p><p>He also tried his best to play the role of a good person.</p><p>Xue Fàlí sighed softly, slowly lowering his eyelids.</p><p>If he revealed his true face, would Jiāng Juàn Wù be afraid?</p><p>Would he still want to get close to him?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Fàlí closed his eyes lightly, his heart filled with some irritability, and a hint of gloom appeared on his expression.</p><p>In the Palace of Nourishing the Heart.</p><p>"Announcing —— Colonel Su Feiyu."</p><p>Manager Wāng called out in a sharp voice.

As Shǎo's heart condition deteriorated, he might not last much longer, but coughing up blood was nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>Apart from this, the thing he deceived Shǎo most profoundly was something else.</p><p>Shǎo thought he was a good person.</p><p>He also made great efforts to portray himself as a good person.</p><p>Xue Fàlí sighed softly, slowly lowering his eyelids.</p><p>If he revealed his true face, would Jiāng Juàn Wù be afraid?</p><p>Would he still want to get close to him?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Fàlí closed his eyes lightly, his heart filled with some irritability, and a hint of gloom appeared on his expression.</p><p>In the Palace of Nourishing the Heart.</p><p>"Announcing —— Colonel Su Feiyu."</p><p>Manager Wāng called out in a sharp voice.

He had already passed the age of forty, but he did not look old on his face. Su Feiyu smiled and said, "His Majesty is still as magnificent and martial as ever."</p><p>Emperor Xing laughed contemptuously, "According to Zhao Shi's report, you are still idle, spending the day drinking and fishing."</p><p>Su Feiyue pondered for a moment and said, "I'm not that idle; I occasionally do some proper work as well."</p><p>Emperor Xing became interested, "Oh? Proper work?"</p><p>Su Feiyue spoke slowly, "Drawing eyebrows for Fu Xue and painting flower-shaped pins for her."</p><p>The Fu Xue he mentioned was the Empress. Emperor Xing scolded him, "Stop being so frivolous with me."</p><p>After a pause, Emperor Xing stopped smiling and said coolly, "You were once my top graduate and a favored disciple of Baixue Tang, yet now you are indulging in leisure activities without achieving anything."</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled and replied rather cheekily, "Your Majesty, I can't help it; who would have thought that this soft rice is so delicious?"</p><p>Emperor Xing cursed him again before saying, "When you left with Fu Xue for Jing, I wanted to summon you to the palace. You ran too fast and Fu Xue kept stopping you, so I didn't say anything. Now that your old friends have seen you and you've toured the mountains and waters, shouldn't you help alleviate my worries?"</p><p>Su Feiyue did not respond but said instead, "That depends on how troublesome Your Majesty's worries are."</p><p>Emperor Xing did not want to play games, "As for my sons, which one do you think is most capable of taking over?"</p><p>"These days, I feel increasingly powerless. The matter of establishing a heir has been postponed again and again, but it seems I can no longer delay it further."</p><p>Su Feiyue was silent for a moment and asked Emperor Xing, "Do you want to hear the truth or lies?"</p><p>Emperor Xing looked him in the eye, "Start with something pleasant."</p><p>Su Feiyue said, "When I served as the Lord of the Younger Tutor, I had some interaction with two princes. The eldest prince is straightforward and resolute, while the fifth prince—Prince Li—possesses a wealth of wisdom akin to that of demons, already wielding significant influence even in his youth. As for the sixth prince..."</p><p>"He is quite innocent yet strong-willed."</p><p>Emperor Xing nodded, "Your flattery does sound nice."</p><p>Pause for a moment, Emperor Xinghong said, "What's the truth?"</p><p>Su Fiyue spoke slowly, "None of them can be entrusted with important tasks. Your Majesty would do better to nod your head a few more times and see if any of your grandsons can be trusted with responsibility."</p><p>After hearing this, Emperor Xinghong did not get angry but instead asked him, "Is Fifth Young Master unsuitable?"</p><p>"Fifth Young Master has always been gifted, as for the rest—your Majesty's power is such that he may act unpredictably and cruelly. These aspects can still be controlled."</p><p>Su Fiyue frowned, reminding him, "Your Majesty, no one can currently control the Prince at present. Who will be able to control him in the future?"</p><p>"Your Majesty has never established a Crown Prince precisely because of the numerous ministers in court who criticize the Prince relentlessly? I'm not even mentioning others; Generals Jiang and Chancellor Gu often advise Your Majesty, and they are deeply worried."</p><p>"Your Majesty, in my opinion, it seems that the Prince does not have such intentions. Although Your Majesty wishes to bestow it upon him, he may not necessarily want it."</p><p>A rustling sound was heard as the rain intensified. Emperor Xinghong slowly raised his head. After a long while, he muttered, "Yes, he hates me so much."</p><p>"Even if I were to offer it to him, he might not accept it…"</p>
