						<p>Consciousness was drifting.</p><p>"Princess!"</p><p>"Mister! Mister——!"</p><p>"Jiang Juan."</p><p>Darkness, the calls did not cease, Jiang Juan felt very noisy and also very tired. He did not want to see anyone; he just wanted to sleep well again.</p><p>His consciousness gradually faded away, the voices moving farther and farther away. It seemed as if he had returned to a place of silence once more, sinking back into his sweet dreams.</p><p>"Jiang Juan."</p><p>Someone called him again. The man almost gritted his teeth as he spoke the name, his voice unusually cold, his tone reaching its peak of impatience.</p><p>It was the Prince.</p><p>Jiang Juan thought hazily.</p><p>Why is the Prince angry again?</p><p>Why does he always get angry?</p><p>Jiang Juan felt a bit bewildered. His scattered consciousness began to gather at one point as he slowly started to think.</p><p>Had he slept for too long?</p><p>No.</p><p>He napped, and the Prince would not get angry.</p><p>What is the Prince up to again?</p><p>It seems to be him—</p><p>On top of the pagoda, the stairs twisted, and he looked down. The tattered robe swept past as a strong gust hit his back, causing an instant sensation of weightlessness. Jiang Juan stumbled and fell, spinning around.</p><p>“Crash!”</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly sat up.</p><p>In the next second, he was pulled into someone’s arms.</p><p>It was very late at night, and there was no light in the room. Jiang Juan could see nothing, but that embrace was too familiar for him. He pressed his forehead against the person's chest.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>A weak voice, Xue Fangli sat on the bed, holding Jiang Juan tightly.</p><p>His anger was so great that he seemed ready to crush Jiang Juan, and although Jiang Juan struggled slightly, still reeling from shock, being held so tightly made him feel secure.</p><p>"I think I fell down the stairs."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, but his eyes were bloodshot, with the redness intensifying.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Jiang Juan felt incredibly unlucky. He touched himself and found only a slight injury on his forehead, and it seemed to be well treated already.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Painful?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment, shook his head, and said reluctantly, "It doesn't hurt."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a long time before sneering, "I would rather you said it hurts."</p><p>"… I’m sorry."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly, "No wonder you are always uneasy. I indeed… couldn’t protect you well enough."</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled and could tell that the prince was upset. He hurriedly said, "Your Highness, it’s not your fault."</p><p>"It was my own decision to climb the tower. It was also my own…"</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan remembered something.</p><p>If not for the appearance of the old monk and the young monk, if not for that one call out, Master Ananda, Jiang Juan would have been standing at the viewing platform looking around, only to be pushed down from there, resulting in him falling from a five-story Buddha tower instead of just tumbling down the staircase.</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes trembled, "Your Highness…"</p><p>No, no.</p><p>The prince was already blaming himself enough. He shouldn’t tell the prince about it.</p><p>Thinking about it made Jiang Juan feel chills go up his spine. He tried to calm himself and said to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, it’s not your fault, and I don’t blame you either."</p><p>After a short pause, Jiang Juan asked curiously, "Your Highness, it’s so dark outside. Didn’t you light any lamps?"</p><p>"Light a lamp?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli paused for a moment before lifting Jiang Juan’s face. The young man’s eyes were pitch black but devoid of life. As if he realized something, he slowly asked, "Can’t you see?"</p><p>Jiang Juan answered: "It's so dark, can you see anything?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Silence filled the air.</p><p>After a long while, Xue Fangli repressed his anger and said emotionlessly, "Call the imperial physician."</p><p>It was noon at that moment, and the daylight was bright.</p><p>The imperial physician, Sun Taiyi, arrived very quickly.</p><p>He took Jiang Juan's pulse and examined him. Soon, Sun Taiyi understood the situation and said with a bitter smile, "Your Excellency must have hit your head, causing blood clots to obstruct your vision."</p><p>"It's not a serious issue; you will recover on your own after resting for a few days."</p><p>Since it was not a serious matter, Sun Taiyi even did not prescribe any medicine for Jiang Juan and only gave him some instructions before leaving with his medical bag.</p><p>Jiang Juan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He was not celebrating himself; he simply could not help but say that he should have asked the Prince why there was no light at midnight. If something had gone wrong with his eyes, Jiang Juan felt the Prince would feel more guilty.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jiang Juan said softly, "Your Highness, the imperial physician said you will be fine in a few days."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan for a moment and responded with a single "hum," indicating he had heard.</p><p>Jiang Juan could not see Xue Fangli's face or read his expression. After some thought, he raised his hand, intending to touch the Prince's face, but he couldn't reach it. So Jiang Juan said, "Your Highness, could you come closer?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not move, but understanding Jiang Juan's intention, he grabbed Jiang Juan's hand and placed it on his own face.</p><p>Jiang Juan wildly fumbled around, but he could not figure anything out. He said in frustration, "Your Excellency, are you feeling any better now?"</p><p>He emphasized, "I don't blame you for the injury... it's just a bruise on my eyes; it will be fine after a few days."</p><p>The injured person was Jiang Juan, yet he was soothing someone else. Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time with a dark expression, "But I... blame myself."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he let go of Jiang Juan's hand and stood up.</p><p>His hand fell empty, and Jiang Juan instinctively reached out to grab him, but the silk slipped through his fingers. Jiang Juan could not hold on to anything; sitting on the bed, he could see nothing and only shouted anxiously, "Your Excellency."</p><p>"Wait a moment, Your Excellency."</p><p>Jiang Juan was in a panic; he did not have time to think as he tried to get out of bed. After feeling his way around, he finally stepped onto the floor. Supporting himself with the edge of the bed, Jiang Juan attempted to stand up, but after taking a few steps, he stumbled.</p><p>He fell into someone's arms again.</p><p>"Running away?"</p><p>The man's voice was cold and his expression sinister, yet Jiang Juan did not notice, even wrapping his arms around him tightly.</p><p>"Why are you running?" Jiang Juan said seriously, "Your Excellency, I really don't blame you. You should also not blame yourself."</p><p>Xue Fangli made no response but simply picked up Jiang Juan. The person in his arms was light as a feather, and he glanced at him.</p><p>Jiang Juan had lain in bed for three days, losing considerable weight. His chin was sharp, his skin almost transparently pale, and he appeared frail like paper.</p><p>How could he not blame himself?</p><p>Xue Fangli thought.</p><p>The boy had always been troublesome, prone to being spoiled and hurting himself. Xue Fangli knew the boy's temperament but still left him alone to climb the tower. He had promised to protect the boy but failed to keep his word.</p><p>"Your Highness, don't be unreasonable. Don't leave me alone."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent as he laid Jiang Juan on the bed. However, Jiang Juan hugged him tightly and rubbed against him like a small animal, "Your Highness, did you hear? Did you?"</p><p>Acting spoiled again.</p><p>Why is she so fond of being spoiled?</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. After a moment, he said calmly, "I heard."</p><p>"There was no intention to leave you. This King just had some things to attend to."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan exclaimed, "Ah." He realized that his statement about attending to something was merely a softening of his attitude, and truly believed that His Highness had important matters to handle. Immediately, he let go and stopped bothering him, "Alright then, Your Highness, hurry up and take care of it."</p><p>"It's just..."</p><p>Everything turned black before his eyes, which Jiang Juan found disorienting. Even though he knew there were many servants around, not just himself, he felt uneasy when His Highness was away. He spoke slowly, "Your Highness, I can't see anything at all and feel a bit scared. Please finish up quickly and come back to me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan was genuinely distressed, his expression dazed and helpless. He sat on the bed, not daring to make any significant movements, being obedient to the point of being pitiful.</p><p>Xue Fangli immediately responded when he heard Jiang Juan's voice, but wasn't sure if he was there. After waiting for a while, Jiang Juan hesitantly asked, "Your Highness?"</p><p>"Your Highness, are you there?"</p><p>Just as Xue Fangli was about to speak, he heard hurried footsteps. Lan Ting encountered Doctor Sun on the way and learned that Jiang Juan had awakened but temporarily had vision problems, so he rushed over.</p><p>"Young Master! Young Master!"</p><p>Lan Ting silently bowed to Xue Fangli and walked to the bedside. Jiang Juan turned his head, "Is it you, Lan Ting?"</p><p>"Servant."</p><p>Jiang Juan took a deep breath. It was good that Lanting was here, even though the Prince wasn't...</p><p>"Lanting, I have something to tell you; don't mention it to the Prince."</p><p>Lanting was startled and turned to Schue Fangli, who gave her a cold glance, silencing her.</p><p>She was about to say that the Prince was there.</p><p>"I met Master Ananda."</p><p>On the Mirror Flower Tower, Jiang Juan had felt the name familiar, prompting him to look into it. Later, he suddenly remembered why it sounded familiar.</p><p>Lanting mentioned someone to him once, saying that this master had calculated his destiny.</p><p>—"He said that Young Master would face hardships at eighteen. If he survives, fortune and blessings will come his way, but his personality might change. If he can't make it... well, Young Master is dead."</p><p>Lanting was astonished, "Master Ananda? Young Master, you met him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "He... seemed to have saved my life."</p><p>Jiang Juan told Lanting about what happened after he climbed the tower, including how Master Ananda called him into the tower, the three trials that left him disoriented. Lanting covered her mouth and finally managed to say a word, repeating only, "Fortunately, fortunately."</p><p>Jiang Juan was quite afraid, "I almost died."</p><p>Lanting was also extremely frightened, but as she raised her head, her limbs felt weak and she gasped in alarm.</p><p>A man stood at the door with ice-cold breath. His eyes were bloodshot, like those of a demon.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked her, "Lanting, what's wrong?"</p><p>Lan Ting stuttered, "H-how… just thinking about how close Young Master you came to being pushed off the tower, I…" She was so frightened, let alone the Prince. Jiang Juan said, "Lan Ting, don't tell the Prince; he'll definitely be more upset."</p><p>"…Okay."</p><p>As Lan Ting nodded, Xue Fangli lifted his foot and walked away, looking ferocious.</p><p>Venerable Ananda?</p><p>What Venerable Ananda? It's just someone pretending to be something they're not.</p><p>There was nothing he needed to do before, but now Xue Fangli suddenly had something to deal with.</p><p>Have someone find Ananda.</p><p>And—</p><p>torture the person who injured Jiang Juan.</p><p>The young man almost fell off the tower.</p><p>He nearly… lost his life.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes, blood surging in his eyes.</p><p>I was supposed to come early to accompany him. The Prince would have come too, but Jiang Juan felt it had been a long time—long enough for him to fall asleep deeply.</p><p>Wrapped in a familiar embrace, Jiang Juan opened his eyes groggily, seeing darkness all around. He closed them again and weakly complained, "Prince, why are you only coming now?"</p><p>Coming right away and waking him up.</p><p>Xue Fali placed his hand on the back of his shoulder and smiled faintly, "The matter is a bit troublesome."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "Oh." The Wangye had just taken a bath, emitting a pleasant scent. However, it seemed to be mixed with another odor.</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately became alert; his drowsiness vanished as he wriggled around in the man’s embrace, sniffing for a long time to ensure that it wasn’t someone else’s smell.</p><p>"Your Highness, did I get it wrong? There seems to be a...rusty smell on you?"</p><p>Xue Fali maintained his expression, "Is there?"</p><p>His ambiguous question made Jiang Juan uncertain as well. He could only ask, "Where have you been?"</p><p>Xue Fali replied indifferently, "The study."</p><p>Study.</p><p>The study should emit an inkish scent.</p><p>Jiang Juan was utterly perplexed. He wanted to ask more but his chin was lifted by someone, "Do you want something? Are you done sleeping?"</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan’s lips were lightly licked, a soft and moist sensation serving as a silent threat.</p><p>His eyelashes flickered. Normally, he would immediately submit, but at this moment, he felt an inexplicable desire to be kissed. He licked his own lips and stammered, "Your Highness, I think I’m done sleeping."</p><p>Xue Fali looked at him thoughtfully. Jiang Juan waited for a while and grew increasingly unhappy, "Your Highness, you can’t even hug people properly, let alone kiss them. Was my hint not clear enough?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fali asked him with an enigmatic smile, "Why do you always know how to annoy me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan touched his face, "You’re annoying but also sweet. Don’t you want to kiss me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said slowly: "This king can't, how do I kiss?"</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered: "... When you let me kiss, you don't. When you don't let me kiss, you insist on it. Your Highness, you are truly out of place."</p><p>The King couldn't do it, Jiang Juan concluded. Since the King wasn't moving, she moved herself. She roughly felt around and then kissed him proactively.</p><p>She missed her mark.</p><p>Her fingers fumbled, and her soft lips brushed against his, her animal-like kissing style only fueling his desire. Xue Fangli sighed softly, pinched Jiang Juan's chin tightly, and finally kissed her.</p><p>Unlike Jiang Juan's innocent kisses, his were highly aggressive, almost as if he was devouring her alive, hot and scorching.</p><p>Xue Fangli seemed accustomed to rubbing Jiang Juan's heart while kissing her, and his hands moved along with his lips.</p><p>Jiang Juan was nearly melted into a puddle by the kiss, completely dazed, forgetting that she had a heart condition that might flare up and didn't need such treatment. She also forgot—</p><p>Even if he rubbed her heart, his fingers didn't need to probe under her clothes.</p><p>After some time, a gust of wind blew through, the window half-open creaked shut, startling Jiang Juan awake.</p><p>Instinctively, she pushed Xue Fangli away, but at that moment, she realized her clothes had already been removed, crumpled near her elbow. The kiss was no longer limited to her lips; it even seemed to be moving downward.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "........"</p><p>She was annoyed and angry, biting Xue Fangli's lip in frustration.</p><p>A trace of blood spread over her tongue, Jiang Juan frowned. She intended to complain, but in a flash, she remembered something, and her body stiffened.</p><p>It wasn't the taste of rust.</p><p>The smell on the prince's body was not one of rust.</p><p>It was a diluted scent of blood.</p>
