						<p>A loud crash echoed as the wine glass shattered on the table. Duke Ping of An abruptly rose from his seat and strode towards the woman, grabbing her shoulder and yanking off her jade pendant.</p><p>After confirming it was the token he shared with Jiang Juan, Duke Ping stood dazed for a long time, myriad thoughts flashing through his mind. Clenching his teeth, he asked word by word, "How did this jade pendant end up on you?"</p><p>"Did you steal it?"</p><p>The woman was stunned by this sudden turn of events and only managed to shake her head frantically after a while, "Your Excellency, that's not the case..."</p><p>Duke Ping growled, "Be more careful!"</p><p>The woman hurriedly knelt down, her face pale with fear. "Your Excellency, it really wasn't stolen by me. If I had stolen it, how could I wear it so openly?"</p><p>Clasping the jade pendant tightly, Duke Ping closed his eyes and when he reopened them, instead of questioning the woman further, he looked at Jiang Juan with a complex expression.</p><p>If the jade pendant was not stolen, then there could only be one other possibility.</p><p>This possibility would make Duke Ping lose his last shred of hope. His recent actions would end up becoming a laughing stock.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Duke Ping asked Jiang Juan, "How did this jade pendant come to be on you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was equally bewildered. "I don't know."</p><p>He recognized the jade pendant.</p><p>It had been displayed in a bookstore. When Duke Ping mentioned their tokens, he thought of giving it to Jiang Juan for some silver coins, as it was quite valuable, but the Prince said there was no need and suggested storing it in the palace vaults instead. So, Jiang Juan handed it over to the Prince.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked blankly at him, clearly showing his ignorance. Duke Ping's wildly racing heart finally calmed down a bit. He asked Jiang Juan softly, "But did you steal it from her?"</p><p>How could Jiang Juan know? He glanced up and sought Sch Fanli's gaze with his eyes.</p><p>"Your own belongings, and you don't even know?"</p><p>Jiang Juan really didn't know. It was a pity that Duke of Pingan was unaware of the situation; he only felt Jiang Juan's actions were glaring and almost couldn't help but say these words.</p><p>"…"</p><p>He felt so wronged, being unjustly accused. Even the saltiest fish could not tolerate it. Jiang Juan slowly said, "My Lord, you also said it’s my thing. How can you be more concerned than me?"</p><p>"I——"</p><p>Duke of Pingan paused and managed to hold back. He only persistently asked again, "Amulet, was it stolen from you…?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to answer when Xue Fangli leisurely interjected, "It's just an amulet, My Lord. No matter how many times you ask, if he doesn't have a memory of it, there’s no point."</p><p>After pausing briefly, he slightly raised his chin, "If you really want to know, why not ask him…?"</p><p>No memory?</p><p>How could there be no memory?</p><p>The calmness in his heart was violently shaken by these words. Duke of Pingan gave Jiang Juan a deep look and gritted his teeth as he continued to question the woman, "If it wasn't stolen from you, then how did you get this amulet?!"</p><p>The woman naturally dared not hide anything and stammered, "This servant has an old acquaintance who is the steward of Prince Li's mansion. His name is Gao. He often comes to Hongxiu Pavilion for entertainment, and he gave me this amulet as a gift."</p><p>"He said—it was a reward from his master…"</p><p>A reward.</p><p>A reward.</p><p>Jiang Juan said he didn't know, and Prince Li claimed he had no memory of it. Could it be that it was truly—given as a reward to the servant?!</p><p>He thought Jiang Juan kept the amulet because he harbored affection for her.</p><p>Also, because Jiang Juan kept the jade pendant, he believed she harbored affection and bore resentment towards himself.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan had long since turned a deaf ear to him.</p><p>Jiang Juan took the jade pendant but did not casually give it as a reward to her servants.</p><p>From beginning to end, it was all his own imagination.</p><p>No wonder there was no trace of emotion in Jiang Juan's eyes anymore.</p><p>No wonder when she looked at him again, it was as if he were a stranger.</p><p>His emotions kept fluctuating, and the last bit of hope was shattered. A huge sense of humiliation overwhelmed him, and the Marquis of Anping felt both furious and stifled.</p><p>Since that was the case, why didn't Jiang Juan allow the jade pendant to be broken on that day?</p><p>Why did she keep the jade pendant, sending him a misplaced signal, making him feel unjustly guilty and prompting him to try to make amends!</p><p>The Marquis of Anping felt blood surging in his head, his vision went dark, and he clenched his fists tightly, almost biting through his teeth. "You kept the jade pendant for today?"</p><p>"To shame this marquis today?"</p><p>The Marquis of Anping angrily threw the jade pendant to the ground, staring at Jiang Juan with a venomous look, and slowly said, "You—really are good."</p><p>"Your Excellency, you forgot something."</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was cold. "Whether my queen is good or not is none of your business. You—what do you amount to?"</p><p>With that, he lifted the curtain. Xue Fangli smiled sarcastically, his eyes carrying a hint of warning. The Marquis of Anping met his gaze, feeling his heart pierced by coldness and extreme danger in that moment.</p><p>No matter how great his resentment or anger, upon meeting his eyes, all he felt was endless fear. No matter how unwillingly or how gritting his teeth in hatred, the Marquis of Anping could only say, "As your highness says."</p><p>"Zhao shi——xīng dōng yě bù suàn."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled faintly, looking down at his disheveled appearance and nodded arrogantly, "You know it's enough."</p><p>Duke of Ping'an gritted his teeth and lowered his head. He was drowning in water, like a wet hen, making him look as absurd and pitiful as possible.</p><p>But no matter how pitiful he looked, it could not erase the intense humiliation that came from his dignity being trampled on so fiercely.</p><p>It was all his own infatuation.</p><p>From beginning to end, it was all because of his own infatuation.</p><p>Since that was the case, he would see just how long King Li's favor lasted!</p><p>Jiang Juan would regret this someday!</p><p>He clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Xue Chaohua looked at Duke of Ping'an and then at Xue Fangli, feeling that today's events had turned out terribly awkward.</p><p>He hurriedly waved his hand, instructing someone to take the dazed Duke of Ping'an away. He forced a smile as he said to Xue Fangli, "Fifth Brother, what happened today is truly..."</p><p>Oh dear, too absurd.</p><p>He had wanted to invite Duke of Ping'an as an envoy, but instead of achieving that, he ended up making no one happy.</p><p>Xue Chaohua even suspected that he might have been tricked.</p><p>In this situation, it was clear that his fifth brother's concubine had no interest in Duke of Ping'an at all. On the other hand, Duke of Ping'an seemed to be constantly trying to get closer to her. Could it be that he couldn't find anyone else and deliberately came here to offer some ridiculous plan?</p><p>The more Xue Chaohua thought about it, the more suspicious he became.</p><p>Yin sun, zhuo yin sun!</p><p>He cursed inwardly but was suddenly caught off guard by Xue Fangli's half-smile, half-laugh: "Brother, are you helping someone to secretly make an appointment with this Wang's concubine?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua froze for a moment and then realized that Old Five was settling accounts with him. He mumbled vaguely, "...This wasn't about asking him to do something on my behalf."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with the same enigmatic smile: "Making an appeal? Brother shouldn't make an appeal for yourself first?"</p><p>His words fell, and Xue Fangli tossed a jade pendant at him. "A few days ago, this Wang was framed by someone. After investigating these past few days, I acquired this jade pendant."</p><p>Xue Chaohua took it and immediately changed his expression, "This matter has absolutely nothing to do with me."</p><p>Xue Fangli said coolly, "I also originally thought so. No matter how dull Brother is, he would not have awarded a jade pendant engraved with his own name. Today's incident, however, has broadened this Wang's horizons; perhaps it really was something done by Brother."</p><p>He was criticizing him as stupid both overtly and covertly. Naturally, Xue Chaohua reacted accordingly, but even if he did, it didn't change anything. He could only force a smile: "Little brother, this matter has nothing to do with me. Give me a few days, I will definitely investigate thoroughly and give you an account."</p><p>Xue Fangli made no response, only asking Jiang Juan, "Do you like lotus seed porridge?"</p><p>He changed the topic so quickly that Jiang Juan was momentarily stunned. He nodded eagerly, "Yes, it's delicious."</p><p>Xue Chaohua seemed to catch on to something from that and asked tentatively: "If you like it, this Palace will have the chef write down the recipe for you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "The person who makes it is different; the taste differs too."</p><p>Xue Chaohua fell silent for a moment. He seemed to understand as he cautiously asked, "Then...take the chef with you as well?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked leisurely, "Is Brother willing to part with him?"</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "...Of course."</p><p>What a load of crap.</p><p>Treat this place as a restaurant if you will, but one of them got so excited that he even wanted to take the chef away, not to mention his mannerisms.</p><p>If you want the chef, take him, but do you really want to part with me? Are you human? Are you human? Are you human?</p><p>Xue Chaohua maintained a smile; he was quite reluctant, but today he had offended Xue Fangli terribly. Moreover, there was the matter of the jade pendant. No matter how unwilling he was, Xue Chaohua reluctantly waved his hand, "Take him away, take him away."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Respect begets respect; command is more effective."</p><p>Xue Chaohua: "..."</p><p>Damn it, dead men don’t tell tales.</p><p>Not only did I fail to get what I wanted, but I lost my wife and troops.</p><p>Xue Chaohua felt extremely frustrated. Jiang Juan, on the other hand, was quite pleased.</p><p>He knew that the Prince had mentioned lotus soup because of him and that he had taken the chef away also because of him. Unable to contain himself, Jiang Juan said to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, you are really good."</p><p>Xue Fangli sized him up for a moment before lifting his red lips in a light smile, "Mm-hmm."</p><p>Regarding the Jade Pendant of the Duke of Anping, Xue Fangli had expected Jiang Juan to ask him a few questions about it. However, Jiang Juan seemed to have completely forgotten about it, and so Xue Fangli naturally did not bring it up either.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan said, "Your Highness, come here for a moment; I have something to say to you."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes as he noticed the gleam in Jiang Juan's eyes. His heart stirred slightly, and he thought of that one time when he had called him 'husband.' He bowed slightly towards Jiang Juan, pretending not to care, "Hm? What did you have to say?"</p><p>Jiang Juan suddenly grabbed his face and asked gloomily, "Your Highness, what's wrong?"</p><p>"The Duke’s jade pendant; I said it could be used as payment, but you wouldn’t let me use it, and then you told me to store it in the warehouse. But you never did."</p><p>Jiang Juan spoke slowly, "I think now is a good time for you to explain properly."</p>
