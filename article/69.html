						<p>Dong Feixin.</p><p>Dong ...</p><p>Jiang Juan’s eyelashes twitched suddenly. Something was approaching, a breath that felt familiar yet safe, but his heart still pounded like drums.</p><p>Scorching and passionate.</p><p>The kiss, however, was soft to an extreme.</p><p>Xue Fangli landed a kiss—perhaps it couldn’t even be called a kiss. It was just rubbing, just touching. He was vicious, fearless, yet unusually cautious and meticulous with everything related to Jiang Juan.</p><p>For instance, in this moment.</p><p>He wanted to kiss Jiang Juan but feared scaring the boy, so this kiss was restrained.</p><p>He lusted after Jiang Juan but didn’t want to make the boy cry, so even a kiss was delivered with patience and comfort.</p><p>The kiss had yet to end, and they were still rubbing against each other.</p><p>So tender that it could not be surpassed. Jiang Juan really wasn’t bothered, just too helpless, helpless to the point of forgetting how to breathe. He could only look at Xue Fangli with his moist eyes.</p><p>Always like this, he deliberately ignored or avoided things that seemed clear in this moment.</p><p>No wonder he didn’t want the prince to be sad.</p><p>No wonder he favored the prince.</p><p>He... had feelings.</p><p>So he had been avoiding it all along.</p><p>He had always been swept away by Mo's panic.</p><p>Because the Prince did not stay with him for long.</p><p>Because the Prince would always leave, never to carry him again or sleep with him, never to support him anymore.</p><p>He thought that if he covered his ears and held his heartbeat, he could pretend nothing had happened, convincing himself that he only wanted to accompany the Prince one last time. But it wasn't so simple.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very afraid.</p><p>But when it came to the Prince, he could not accept it calmly.</p><p>Thinking about it alone made him feel miserable.</p><p>He was afraid, terribly afraid.</p><p>Afraid to...</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>Unconsciously, tears fell silently. Jiang Juan looked so pitiful, his nose red, his tail also red, as if he had been bullied and was extremely wronged.</p><p>"Don't like this Prince kissing you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his head, ending the kiss. He looked at Jiang Juan for a long time, then used his fingertip to wipe away his tears, speaking softly, "If you don't like it, push this Prince away. Is crying about it necessary?"</p><p>No, it wasn't that he didn't like it.</p><p>He did not dislike it.</p><p>Jiang Juan's mood was extremely low, he opened his mouth but said nothing, eventually lowering his head and burying his face in Xue Fangli's embrace, once again choosing to avoid the issue.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan muttered, "Your Highness, I don't want to be with you when you die."</p><p>Even if it meant doing business, he wanted Your Highness to live for some more time.</p><p>He wanted Your Highness to spend more time with him.</p><p>In the government office.</p><p>"Qing Laogong, please stand up for me... "</p><p>The woman knelt before the platform, repeatedly bowing her head. Anping Marquis stood beside her with a dark expression, coldly watching her, remaining silent throughout.</p><p>Prefect Zhang Shu held his paddle, looking at her helplessly and then at Anping Marquis, feeling truly unlucky.</p><p>What should have been a minor case turned complicated when Anping Marquis broke the jade pendant of a prostitute named Hongyu in the Red Sleeve Pavilion. Usually, such a matter could be easily hushed up, but this Hongyu had brought a warrant from Li Wang to accuse Anping Marquis.</p><p>On one side was Li Wang, and on the other was Anping Marquis. As a second-rank official, he found himself entangled in the situation. This, this—</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>"Marquis, do you have any objections?"</p><p>Zhang Shu smiled apologetically, cautiously asking Anping Marquis.</p><p>Anping Marquis had been publicly taken away from a tavern and was now accused of bullying a weak woman. Naturally, he felt furious, but he knew he had to give Zhang Shu some face, so he uttered two words: "No."</p><p>This was an admission, so Zhang Shu said pretentiously, "Since that's the case, according to our dynasty's criminal law, damaging someone else's property should..."</p><p>Compensate for the loss and detain him for three days.</p><p>However, this is Prince Ping of Anping. Zhang Mengxiong naturally dared not detain him. He cleared his throat and said, "Compensate for the loss. Your Excellency, please compensate for the damage to her jade pendant..."</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, government soldiers approached and whispered a few words in Zhang Mengxiong's ear. Zhang Mengxiong hastily replied, "Double it, Your Excellency, double compensation for the damage to this jade pendant will suffice."</p><p>Prince Ping looked at him but did not ask further questions. He simply took out a stack of silver bills from his pocket and tossed them on the ground. Zhang Mengxiong then asked the woman, "Hongyu, do you have any objections?"</p><p>The jade pendant was originally given as a gift from her lover. She had thought she would be beaten to death, but now she received so much compensation. The woman smiled widely and said, "No, Your Excellency, no objections."</p><p>"Thank you, Prince Ping, Hongyu thanks Your Excellency."</p><p>She hastily picked up the silver bills, glanced at them, and her heart was overjoyed. These silver bills were enough to last her half a lifetime!</p><p>That day, Hongyu was dancing gracefully in Chengde Hall when Prince Ping snatched away the jade pendant and smashed it into pieces.</p><p>As courtesans, they could only earn some silver coins during their youthful beauty days. This jade pendant was her lifeline for her entire life. It had been shattered so easily, causing Hongyu's heart to break as well. However, Li Wang unexpectedly gave her his own token and even suggested she file a complaint against Prince Ping.</p><p>Her lover, who managed Li Manor, explained that Empress Dowager Li was moved by compassion and persuaded His Highness to give her the token so she could sue Prince Ping.</p><p>He also said that that night, Empress Dowager Li specially spoke with him about this matter and asked him to console her.</p><p>Empress Dowager Li truly was a living bodhisattva!</p><p>Hongyu felt more and more grateful as she thought about it.</p><p>No wonder Li Wang favored her so much.</p><p>Someone as good as her deserved such favoritism, didn't she?</p><p>While she was thinking, the sound of singing suddenly echoed from outside the government office.</p><p>"Marshal, come in—!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Su Feiyue strode in swiftly. Upon seeing the Duke of Anping, he made no further ado and slapped him across the face, "Tormenting a mere woman, that's how I always taught you?"</p><p>Seeing Su Feiyue, the Duke of Anping could not maintain his cold expression any longer, "Uncle, I..."</p><p>Su Feiyue sneered, "Don't call me uncle; you dishonor this name!"</p><p>The Duke of Anping moved his lips but knew of Su Feiyue's temper and did not speak further. Su Feiyue then slapped him again, causing Hongyu to jump in fright. She looked at him fearfully. Noticing her gaze, Su Feiyue smiled apologetically and bowed slightly.</p><p>"Marshal, the Duke has given a silver bill; they are now evened up, so there's no need to blame the Duke further."</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyan laughed and tried to mediate, but when Su Feiyue frowned, he asked, "Just a silver bill?"</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyan was taken aback, "What else?"</p><p>Su Feiyue replied coldly, "According to our country's laws, even if they compensate with a silver bill, they should still be detained for three days."</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyan said, "Marshal, this..."</p><p>The Duke of Anping interrupted, "Uncle!"</p><p>Su Feiyue remained unmoved, "Zhang Xiaoyan, follow the law. Being a Duke doesn't mean he can escape punishment; if he breaks the law, he should be treated like any commoner!"</p><p>Zhang Xiaoyan was dumbfounded and felt that it was true to say he was a disciple of Mr. Bai; his nephew had made a mistake, yet he showed no mercy!</p><p>Su Feiyue waited for a moment, "Zhang Xiaoyan?"</p><p>Shaken by the call, Zhang Xiaoyan hurriedly responded, "Then... shall we do as Marshal says?"</p><p>Zhang Youyouyu cautiously responded, Su Fimei nodded slightly, finally showing her satisfaction. The Marquis of Anping asked in disbelief, "Uncle, why are you always like this?"</p><p>"She's just a prostitute!" The Marquis of Anping was filled with rage. "Why don't you inquire what exactly happened?"</p><p>Su Fimei replied coldly, "Very well, tell me, what exactly happened that made you bully a weak woman!"</p><p>"She... "</p><p>The Marquis of Anping closed his eyes, forcing himself to calm down slightly. "That jade pendant was the token of our engagement..."</p><p>"I saw the jade pendant on her. I tore it off—didn't the Concubine leave the pendant to humiliate me? If she could give it away, why can't I smash it?!"</p><p>Su Fimei looked at him for a long time before saying slowly, "Your engagement is dissolved. Why would he keep the pendant?"</p><p>"It's his decision whether to keep or send back the jade pendant," Su Fimei said word by word. "If the Concubine wishes to give it away, she can; if she wants to smash it, she can. What does it have to do with you? How is this an insult?"</p><p>The Marquis of Anping was speechless at her question. "But..."</p><p>"What but?" Su Fimei asked.</p><p>"At that time, it was you who were unhappy with the engagement and dissolved it," Su Fimei said mercilessly. "What are you doing now? Are you resentful? Regretful? Otherwise, why do you pursue what happened to the pendant?"</p><p>"I... "</p><p>Regretful?</p><p>The Marquis of Anping asked himself.</p><p>He had never wanted to admit it or avoid this question, but every time he found himself involuntarily gazing at Jiang Juan and feeling resentment.</p><p>Resentment for his swift change of heart, resentment for his focus solely on the Concubine.</p><p>He...</p><p>Seemed to regret it.</p><p>Otherwise, why would he care about the jade pendant?</p><p>Why would he angrily smash this piece of jade?</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Duke Ping An was frozen in place.</p><p>Su Feiyue did not want an answer; he simply said with disappointment, "In these three days, you should reflect on yourself."</p><p>"We raised you as a foster parent, and this is how you repay us!"</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Su Feiyue continued, "Since you proactively mentioned the betrothal and unilaterally broke it off, you have not apologized either. Three days later, I will go with you to the Palace of Departure to apologize to Princess Li."</p><p>After finishing his words, Su Feiyue did not look at him again, only bowing slightly to Zhang (character missing), before leaving.</p><p>Zhang (character missing) stood there for a while, looking at Duke Ping An's ashen face. He waved his hand and cautiously asked, "Your Excellency?"</p><p>Duke Ping An walked a few steps in a daze.</p><p>Yes, he regretted it.</p><p>He regretted breaking the betrothal.</p><p>But he still had to go apologize for breaking the betrothal.</p><p>With a clatter, he entered the cell, the door was locked, and Duke Ping An's heart sank along with it.</p><p>He regretted it.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>At night.</p><p>At the General's residence.</p><p>"Prince, Princess, this way please."</p><p>The servants of the General's residence led them in with servile compliance.</p><p>Jiang Juan was still in a bad mood and did not say anything along the way. He looked around and found that the General's residence was quite spacious, with a style that was both elegant and simple.</p><p>Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli were invited to the dining area. This time it was a private banquet, so there was only one table. As soon as they arrived, the butler ordered the meal to be set up.</p><p>Soon after, General Jiang Sen Tao arrived slowly. He bowed, "This subordinate greets Prince and Princess."</p><p>"I just practiced a sword routine, hence the delay. Please forgive us, Prince and Princess."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and led Jiang Juan to their seats.</p><p>"I have heard about the matter of the tavern."</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Jiang Sen Tao brought up this topic first. He looked at Xue Fangli with a complicated expression, "Prince's way of handling it was unexpected to this subordinate."</p><p>Over the years, Jiang Sen Tao had been keeping an eye on Xue Fangli and naturally knew how absurd his actions were. Otherwise, that day when he drank with Su Fei Yue, he would not have expressed such hatred in his heart.</p><p>To Xue Fangli, his sister owed him, the Jiang family owed him, and even the Emperor and Empress Dowager owed him.</p><p>Even now, Jiang Sen Tao still remembered a few years ago when he had rushed into Cining Palace to save someone. A teenager kneeling in a pile of filth, slowly lifting his head to look at him, those black eyes cold and hollow, filled with hate that left him shaken.</p><p>He was late.</p><p>Was he really late?</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao, upon seeing the scene, only felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>At that time, Yu Mei—also known as Qingmei after her death—the Emperor Hong Xing grieved so deeply that he locked himself in the Yangxin Pavilion. He neither attended court nor met with officials; even the Empress Dowager was kept outside. Filled with hatred, she vented her anger on Xue Fangli, who was still young.</p><p>She had him lock Liwang and his mother's corpse together in a cell.</p><p>On the fourteenth day.</p><p>Locked up for exactly fourteen days.</p><p>No food or drink were given; nothing at all.</p><p>During those fourteen days, beauty turned into a pool of pus, bones emitting an unbearable stench. Jiang Sen Tao could not even bear to think about how Xue Fangli had survived those fourteen days.</p><p>When his father went late, Qingmei vanished from the world, leaving only Yu Mei. Later, he too went late, and the young man's lips were as red as if he had drunk blood. His eyes were bloodshot, his state akin to madness, "None of you want me to live, but I will live!"</p><p>"Back then she disgusted me, made me drink her blood, and forced me to eat her flesh. She did not want me to live, so even if I drank her blood and ate her flesh, I would still live!"</p><p>"Why should I die just because you all want me to? I want to live well, and that is exactly what I will do!"</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao had fought on the battlefield, his hands stained with countless drops of blood, but at this moment, he felt fear due to a teenager.</p><p>Because his hatred was too profound and intense.</p><p>Even when Jiang Sen Tao received news of Qingmei's death from former officers and learned that the Empress Dowager had imprisoned Xue Fangli, he rushed back from the frontier late night. But what could he do?</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao boasted of his conscience being clear, yet he was no different from Emperor Hong Xing. These years, he had been indulging Xue Fang Li.</p><p>It was only because he knew how bitter Xue Fang Li's youth had been and how deeply ingrained his hatred was.</p><p>"Is that so."</p><p>Xue Fang Li replied coolly, showing no concern. He raised his hand to signal the maid not to serve him and then personally picked up a silver chopstick to feed Jiang Juan, "Try some."</p><p>In a bad mood, he naturally had no appetite. Jiang Juan shook his head, "I don't want to eat."</p><p>He tried to push it away, but Xue Fang Li glanced at him without changing his expression, merely preparing another bowl of crab meat porridge for Jiang Juan, "Drink the porridge."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I really—"</p><p>He was about to shake his head again when Xue Fang Li already brought the crab meat porridge to his lips. Jiang Juan had no choice but to open his mouth.</p><p>But even after taking that one bite, Jiang Juan still shook his head reluctantly. He furrowed his brow and said, "Your Highness, I really don't want to eat."</p><p>Xue Fang Li looked down at him without any displeasure in his voice, speaking gently as if soothing him, "Take another bite."</p><p>In the mansion, Jiang Juan had already gotten used to Xue Fang Li feeding him and coaxing him to eat. It had become second nature to him, so he found nothing strange about it. However, he forgot that he was now in the General's Mansion.</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao had never imagined that Xue Fang Li would be this patient or gentle before. He stared in astonishment.</p><p>A few decades ago, the kneeling youth resembled an evil spirit, deranged by hatred.</p><p>A few decades later, the man wore exquisite attire. His temperament was cold, his eyes lowered, but his gaze towards the person beside him was inexplicably tender.</p><p>"If you don't eat this porridge properly, I'll feed it to you myself."</p><p>He spoke casually, even his threats were gentle.</p>
