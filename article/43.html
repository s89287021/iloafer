						<p>Jiang Juan was still waiting for him to look at the painting when he finally came back to his senses, although it didn't take long before he gave an answer: "I think it's not good."</p><p>He said it wasn't good, but Jiang Juan was still smiling faintly with a blush on his face. The fluttering of his eyelashes made the light dance in an indescribable way.</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyelids, and for a moment, his expression turned dark, but only briefly. He then smiled and asked Jiang Juan leisurely, "Why not?"</p><p>His tone was gentle, and his smile warm, but there was still a dangerous aura emanating from him.</p><p>"......It also has to be considerate."</p><p>Last time, they were still at Miaoling Temple. Jiang Juan had mentioned some things about the prince and his mother-in-law to prevent the prince from being overwhelmed by the past, so he made him pay attention to himself in the future.</p><p>But the prince refused him.</p><p>"So what."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled again, his ruby lips slightly parting as he smiled with a sense of regret and indifference.</p><p>Whether Jiang Juan agreed or not, Xue Fangli already had an answer in mind when he asked the question.</p><p>No matter how Jiang Juan felt, he only needed one answer.</p><p>Asking Jiang Juan was just to show that he was a "good person."</p><p>The only regret was that if Jiang Juan had been more obedient and his answer a bit different, perhaps it would have pleased him, and he would have been more patient.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and saw Jiang Juan asking him again, "Prince, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Hmm?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said gloomily, "zhèngshì bùxíng, nǐ jiù bù wèn yī biàn ma? Wànyi tā gǎi de jīnyì ne?"</p><p>He didn't ask, so Jiang Juan could only imply, "Nǐ jujéguò yī cì, tā yě jujé le nǐ yī cì. Xiànzài wǒmen chēng píngle, Wáng Yé, nǐ juédé néng zài wèn yī biàn le."</p><p>Xue Fangli was stunned, and then a burst of fireworks suddenly rose into the sky, streaming down in light and brilliance. Jiang Juan looked up at the fireworks while Xue Fangli stared intently at him.</p><p>A moment later, Xue Fangli smiled softly, his inner malice completely gone, and he laughed joyfully and lightly.</p><p>Jiang Juan turned to ask him, "Wáng Yé, what are you laughing about?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at the scroll, "Zhè yī fú huà... Have you opened it to look?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. Seeing this, Xue Fangli slowly unfolded the scroll in front of him.</p><p>Huo shù yín huā bùyè.</p><p>They were watching fireworks, and so was the painting.</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help but say, "What a coincidence."</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Yes."</p><p>Those things from those years, he had not forgotten even a trace or a drop. He learned painting to please that woman; he drew her portrait after another for her pleasure.</p><p>Because of Hong Xing Emperor's sān kěn qiú.</p><p>—"Nǐ shì tā de gǔ ròu, nǐ lái jiù shì tā wéiyí de qiānbàn. Nǎ bāng duì zhèn měn hé hěn xīn, yě bù huì hèn nǐ. Tì fùhuáng liú xià tā ba, bié ràng tā zǒu le, Lǎowǔ, tā hěn xīn zhì cǐ, wéiyǒu nǐ néng tì fùhuáng liú xià tā, wéiyǒu nǐ néng ràng tā xīn ruǎn..."</p><p>His departure was merely a counter, a bet.</p><p>His insubstantial and detestable person had, for once, existed for himself, only to then plunge back into endless hatred.</p><p>Seven years later, there was such a young man; he wanted to keep him.</p><p>What he used to hate and despise now softened the youth's heart, making him even more compassionate. He began to be grateful for having enough suffering to manipulate the youth day by day, so that he could stay by his side.</p><p>He should have drowned in endless hatred and disgust, but a hand reached out to him, pulling him back into humanity.</p><p>That was his Little Bodhisattva, who helped him escape from the sea of suffering.</p><p>"Since that is the case, this king can only ask you once more," Xue Fangli said with a smile, "From now on, I will care only about you. What do you think?"</p><p>"You can care if you want," Jiang Juan was unexpectedly honest this time, saying seriously, "Your Highness, you could care a little more."</p><p>"You are in such poor health, with headaches or coughing blood every day. If you cared a little more, perhaps you could live a bit longer, and I would not send you away so soon."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>He paused his action, glancing at Jiang Juan several times. The youth did not only speak seriously but also had an incredibly serious expression, as if he truly believed that Xue Fangli would die before him, and he needed to take care of sending Xue Fangli off.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xue Fangli said nothing, merely smiling faintly: "Alright, I will try to stay longer. As for you, your illness flares up so frequently; you must endure a bit longer."</p><p>Xue Fangli could not keep him for too long. On that day, he would personally send the youth away, but he did not want to do it too soon.</p><p>They stared at each other for a long time, and Jiang Juan sighed lightly.</p><p>—Alas, how severe is his illness? Even if Your Highness stays longer, how much longer can he stay?</p><p>Xue Fangli also lowered his eyelids, with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>——Heart disease flares up so frequently, how long can the young man hold on?</p><p>"Bang——!"</p><p>Fireworks ascended into the sky, sparks blossoming, and the enormous sound made Xue Yun's hand tremble, nearly dropping the teacup. Scalding tea spilled out.</p><p>"Why did His Majesty let them set off fireworks for such a long time?"</p><p>Xue Yun was deeply puzzled. The fireworks show tonight had lasted too long, leaving his ears ringing incessantly.</p><p>Sitting opposite him, Jiang Nian smiled and said, "Presumably the Emperor was in good spirits today, so he allowed them to set off more fireworks."</p><p>During the day, Xue Yun did not go out for a spring outing but instead made dinner plans with Jiang Nian and others at Juyan Pavilion. However, Jiang Qingliang and Duke Anping had matters to attend to, so only Xue Yun, Jiang Nian, and Gu Puwang were present.</p><p>Xue Yun sighed and said, "If it weren't for the fireworks, that Jiang person's incessant prattling would have given me some peace of mind."</p><p>Jiang Nian took a sip of tea and smiled helplessly. Suddenly remembering something, he apologized to Gu Puwang and said, "By the way, I'm afraid we won't be able to attend the archery competition between REXING Hall and GUANGYE Hall tomorrow."</p><p>REXING Hall and GUANGYE Hall were both one of the six halls within the National Academy. The students in REXING Hall were led by Gu Puwang, while those in GUANGYE Hall were led by Jiang Qingliang. They had a good relationship, making their interactions frequent. Recently, they had planned an archery competition, with Jiang Qingliang inviting Jiang Nian to join.</p><p>Hearing the news that Jiang Qingliang was absent, Gu Puwang merely took a sip of tea and calmly replied, "It's no problem if we can't make it."</p><p>Both Gu Puwang and Jiang Qingliang had studied at the National Academy. As one was a chancellor and the other a general, Xue Yun couldn't participate and could only attend classes in the Great Hall honestly without any companions. His days were unbearably dull.</p><p>After some thought, Xue Yun enthusiastically said, "Since Brother Nian can't go, I'll come to watch your competition tomorrow."</p><p>Gu Puwang responded coolly, "You needn't bother. Jiang Qingliang is talkative enough on his own. The two of you together will be unbearable."</p><p>Xue Yun was unhappy and lunged at him, pinching his arm. "His Imperial Majesty graces us with his presence, but you don't even kneel to greet me. You dare to reject me? Damn it, rephrase that."</p><p>Gu Puwang pushed away his hand, too lazy to argue back, and merely adjusted his clothes. Just as Xue Yun was about to continue berating him, he suddenly noticed a group of scholars at the neighboring table discussing Jiang Nian.</p><p>"Have any of you heard, today in the Hundred Flowers Garden, our capital's number one person has changed hands?"</p><p>"Changed hands? Who is it now?"</p><p>"You all guess."</p><p>He suddenly brought up the topic without any hints, so nobody could guess correctly. After a few names were suggested and dismissed, everyone urged him to hurry up and say, "The famous bookshop is still selling..." </p><p>"You don't know, Sir Er Gong is renowned for his gentle and proper demeanor, earning him the title of Xiao Moxian. In front of this person, he doesn't even stand a chance. Yang Liu said—"</p><p>"Sir Er Gong! It's like a firefly's light; that person is like the brilliance of the moon. Sir Er Gong in front of him doesn't amount to anything at all!"</p><p>Jiang Nian's finger trembled, and his teacup fell with a "bang."</p><p>He had long predicted that news about the Hundred Flowers Garden would soon spread throughout the entire capital. But actually hearing it firsthand made him feel uneasy. However, unlike being in the Hundred Flowers Garden, even if he was humiliated now, he couldn't show any displeasure because—</p><p>"Brother Nian, are you okay?"</p><p>He didn't look like it at all. Xue Jun worried greatly, wanting to comfort him but not knowing what to say. Meanwhile, the scholars at that table continued their endless chatter.</p><p>"How is this possible? Is it true?"</p><p>"Don't you know who Yang Liu is? He's a famous master of painting and calligraphy. Only people as good as he can paint such masterpieces. Would you doubt his words?"</p><p>Amidst the exclamations, someone suddenly said, "Speaking of which, the first time I saw Sir Er Gong, I was wondering how he could be the capital's number one person. His face is just plain handsome. But Lord Hou and Sixth Prince both praise him excessively, so I had to go along with it too."</p><p>"Brother Wang, you think so too? To tell you the truth, I thought the same way!"</p><p>"You two also think so? Did you think only he had poor taste and low-level appreciation for Sir Er Gong's work? So it wasn't just him?"</p><p>None of them knew who "Hao Yue" was, yet everyone began to agree. They usually acknowledged that Second Master of the Ministry of Personnel was the number one person in the capital and praised him endlessly when mentioned. Today, they discovered that everyone had their doubts—</p><p>His face did not seem particularly handsome.</p><p>His demeanor was decent, but not the best.</p><p>As for what is called bone structure, it was even more ethereal and intangible.</p><p>The two patriarchs of the Shangshu Mansion were originally unrelated to ordinary people; they insisted on talking about bone structure. To be honest, whether it's bone structure or facial features, as long as there is something, it can always be seen. One cannot say that one aspect is unattractive and then forcefully mention another?</p><p>"So, who is the current number one person?"</p><p>Someone could not help but ask out loud, at the same time, Xue Jun also slammed down his chopsticks and said to Jiang Nian, "Nian Ge, go over there."</p><p>Jiang Nian's face turned pale, his voice full of tenderness, "What are you going to do? Is it because of...? Let them talk, it doesn't matter..."</p><p>Xue Jun looked at him and still stood up, "Let's see for ourselves, Nian Ge, you're not the number one person, who is? Are they really worthy of being called the number one person?"</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly stretched out his hand to stop her, but could not hold her back. Xue Jun rushed over with great momentum, Jiang Nian frowned and looked at her back, his gaze flickering.</p><p>He had spared no effort, doing everything he could to please them, not just for the sake of being called "Nian Ge". They were useful to him, like a fleeting moment.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jiang Nian curled up his lips. He slowly withdrew his gaze and unexpectedly met Gu Puwang's eyes, causing his heart to tremble.</p><p>He got along with Xue Jun, Jiang Qingliang, and Gu Puwang. Among the three of them, he had put in the most effort with Gu Puwang, but it was precisely Gu Puwang who often left him feeling defeated—he was too clear-eyed, as if he pretended to be friends with him while not truly confiding in him; sometimes Jiang Nian felt that Gu Puwang could see through him.</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled at Gu Puwang. Gu Puwang did not say anything but looked towards Xue Jun, who had already walked over to the table of scholars.</p><p>"Hey, you guys——"</p><p>"The current number one person is Wang Xin's newly wedded concubine, and she is also the third patriarch of the Shangshu Mansion!"</p><p>Xue Jun: "..."</p><p>They both opened their mouths at the same time, and his hand almost reached out to pat the speaker's shoulder but then froze mid-air.</p><p>Why was it him?</p><p>Foolish country bumpkin—no, he is now known as Jun. Although he tends to cry a lot, he is still quite handsome.</p><p>Nian's first person gave it to him, and it seemed like...</p><p>There wasn't much of a problem?</p><p>It felt rather fitting.</p><p>Xuejun fell silent.</p><p>The most talkative Shu was followed by someone else, and his companion saw this, their eyes widening in shock. They frantically tried to signal to him with their eyes. Shu, receiving these signals, turned around curiously, almost falling off the chair.</p><p>Six Huang!</p><p>It was Six Huang!</p><p>Who would have thought he was friends with Erong!</p><p>"Si—Six Huang..."</p><p>Thinking about all the bad things she had said about Jiang Nian, Shu hesitantly called out, afraid that Xuejun would punish her. However, Xuejun didn't say anything; he just stared at her, creating an eerie atmosphere.</p><p>After a long moment, Xuejun's hand hanging in mid-air came down slowly. He gave a slightly awkward but polite smile and said, "I made a mistake, see you later."</p><p>And then—</p><p>he left.</p><p>Shu: "???"</p><p>Jiu? Wasn't he here to stand up for Second Master Gong?</p><p>Shu, who had narrowly escaped danger, was completely bewildered, while Jiang Nian was utterly astonished. He recalled Xue Yan's personality; she was always fiery and outspoken. If it were in the past, he would have already overturned their table by now.</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his fists and suddenly felt uneasy. He asked casually, "You seem to have changed your nature today, still worrying?"</p><p>Xue Yan was quite guilty. He didn't dare tell Jiang Nian the truth, feeling that Jiang Juan was a worthy match for the Crown Prince. He whispered, "Fifth Brother is too terrifying. Once he becomes his Concubine Wang, I can't speak up."</p><p>Jiang Nian was stunned. Indeed, with the King's protection of Jiang Juan, Xue Yan could not avoid dealing with them both. If word reached the King, Xue Yan would definitely have trouble.</p><p>Originally, Jiang Nian expected Xue Yan to vent his frustrations today and tone down his words somewhat, but he had miscalculated. Jiang Nian didn't know what to say and could only smile gently, "Well, it's good that you're fine. When you return to the palace, His Majesty won't blame you."</p><p>Xue Yan waved his hand and picked up his teacup for a drink. Thinking of the phrase about the glow of the bright moon and the light of fireflies, Jiang Nian was deeply depressed. He wasn't really indifferent, but he said softly, "Go out to take some fresh air."</p><p>Jiang Nian stood up. After he left, Gu Puwang looked intently at Xue Yan and asked leisurely, "What's going on between you and Concubine Wang?"</p><p>Gu Puwang was just like that; his eyes were sharp enough to spot the slightest hint. Xue Yan leaned over the table and whispered to him, "I had trouble with him once before, but later I felt..."</p><p>Xue Yan scratched his head and asked Gu Puwang, "Have you ever seen him? Anyway, I feel there might be some misunderstanding between him and Brother Nian. He doesn't seem like someone who would push Brother Nian into the lake."</p><p>Gu Puwang thought for a moment. He had no strong impression of the Concubine Wang, only hearing occasional mentions from Jiang Nian. Gu Puwang shook his head, "No."</p><p>As for whether there was any misunderstanding between them, Gu Puwang was even more uncertain. He merely reminded Xue Yan, "Don't ask Brother Nian about misunderstandings."</p><p>Xue Yan looked bewildered, "Why not?"</p><p>Gu Puwang didn't answer.</p><p>His nature tended to be reserved and wasn't like Xue Yan and Jiang Qingliang, who were often naive. Therefore, he somewhat understood that Jiang Nian was not as gentle and indifferent as he appeared.</p><p>Jiang Nian thought this person had ambition and was full of schemes. Since he mentioned Jiang Juan to them, it was clear that he did not like Jiang Juan.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Gu Puwang continued, "Time reveals one's true nature. You've only seen Princess Li a few times, while you've lived with Nian Ge for years; how can you be so sure about him?"</p><p>Xue Jun said, "He... well, I really... sigh, I don't know how to explain it to you."</p><p>The consequence of being unlearned is realizing too late that knowledge is scarce when needed. Xue Jun didn't know how to describe Jiang Juan, but after a moment's thought, he suddenly understood and said, "How about this? Tomorrow during the archery competition, bring him along to play with us."</p><p>"You think he's interesting just by seeing him once."</p><p>Gu Puwang did not comment on whether he was interesting or not, but he noted that Princess Li seemed quite capable. Xue Jun kept talking about Nian Ge all the time and had always been led around by Jiang Nian's nose, but this was the first time he didn't speak up for Jiang Nian.</p><p>Gu Puwang did not mind, and seeing her would at least allow him to figure out what made Princess Li so captivating. "Do as you please."</p>
