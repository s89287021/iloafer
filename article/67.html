						<p>This Living Yama King, how could he be here?</p><p>At this moment, all the patrons in the tavern had their hair standing on end with fear.</p><p>King Li's personality was often cold and vicious, his actions ruthless, and his methods cruel. However, few knew him, or understood him.</p><p>The patrons were frightened, let alone the storyteller, who saw stars before his eyes, wanting nothing more than to pound his chest and stomp his feet.</p><p>If King Li was here, then those accompanying him, including the young man who had just told this story, must be none other than the recently notorious Empress Dowager Li from the capital city.</p><p>—It is said that she is extremely beautiful, so much so that even the renowned painter Yang Liu Sheng marveled at her beauty and called her the most beautiful woman in the world. She was also deeply loved by King Li.</p><p>If he had known, he would have remained silent.</p><p>If he had known, he would have fled immediately.</p><p>The more the storyteller thought about it, the more he felt his life was in mortal danger, trembling as if a sieve.</p><p>Duke Ping of An did not look like him, pale with fear. However, after moving aside the screen and seeing who was inside clearly, his pupils contracted.</p><p>King Li… Jiang Juan.</p><p>Since last time he saw their engagement tokens on the prostitute's body, Duke Ping of An had felt an extremely complicated mix of emotions towards Jiang Juan.</p><p>He hated Jiang Juan. He hated how Jiang Juan did not give him any face, rewarding the prostitute with a jade pendant and letting him suffer humiliation. He also hated how Jiang Juan allowed himself to be misunderstood, acting like a fool while repeatedly stating his intention to compensate but never explaining.</p><p>As his thoughts drifted away, Duke Ping of An's gaze at Jiang Juan became filled with both hate and resentment until he heard Xue Fangli speak again.</p><p>"Your Excellency, what are you so engrossed in?"</p><p>He subconsciously glanced over, seeing a man dressed in dark robes. Though he had rosy lips and white teeth, his laughter sent shivers down one's spine, as if his lips were stained with blood.</p><p>"…Nothing."</p><p>Duke Ping of An was startled and bowed respectfully. "I have met Prince Wang and Princess Wang."</p><p>"At this moment, you know the guests," Xi Fanglei asked him smilingly. "Duke, shall I send out my princess for you?"</p><p>After a pause, he said coldly, "Perhaps even I and my princess will leave to make room for you. What do you think?"</p><p>Duke Ping of An struggled to say, "I did not know it was Prince Wang and Princess Wang."</p><p>"Not knowing? Good not knowing."</p><p>Xi Fanglei smiled with a hint of mockery. "You have quite an imposing presence, Your Excellency. I feel ashamed in comparison."</p><p>Seeing his insistence on probing the matter, Duke Ping of An bit his tongue discreetly. He raised both hands high and bowed deeply, offering an apology proactively. "Princess, what I said just now was very rude. Please forgive me."</p><p>"Regardless of how you say it, as a princess, you should speak to me like this."</p><p>It seemed that Duke Ping of An was apologizing, but in fact, he was secretly undermining Jiang Juan.</p><p>His "regardless of how you say it" referred not only to Jiang Juan's previous arrogance but also to his own ignorance of who lay behind the screen. The meaning was clear.</p><p>He apologized only because he had offended them. In front of Prince Wang and Princess Wang, as a Duke, he naturally could not speak like this, but he still agreed with the princess's actions.</p><p>Thus, by merely apologizing, Duke Ping of An earned himself some reputation.</p><p>Indeed, most of the guests present were swayed by his words. Although they appeared unmoved on the surface, after hearing what Duke Ping of An said, they sighed in admiration.</p><p>Duke Ping of An was truly noble and righteous!</p><p>Shi Kai is truly deserving of being pointed out by Mr. Bai; he indeed inherited some of Mr. Bai's true teachings!</p><p>But who is this Mr. Bai?</p><p>Baixue Chao is known for his integrity and righteousness, his impartiality between public and private matters, and his strict enforcement of justice against corrupt officials. For these reasons, he was widely admired and respectfully called Mr. Bai.</p><p>Anping Marquis studied under Mr. Bai, although it was a secret in the capital city. People naturally admired him for his sincere apology while remaining steadfast in his convictions.</p><p>However, Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli did not include themselves in this admiration.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt wronged and had never been spoken to like that by even a prince. Regardless of whether they called him Anping Marquis or advised him to be cautious, he had already offended them many times. So Jiang Juan said, "Why should I tolerate it just because you say so? My heart is as narrow as a needle."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not dwell on the matter, but Xue Fangli was moved by Anping Marquis's sincerity.</p><p>He held Jiang Juan's hand, his sleeves covering Xue Fangli's fidgeting fingers. His voice calm, he said, "Did Lord Marquis hear? The concubine is still upset. What should we do?"</p><p>"He has heart problems. Usually in the palace, I let him suffer a little."</p><p>Anping Marquis spoke softly.</p><p>"If that's the case, then I'll make the decision myself," Xue Fangli said. "Servants, take Lord Marquis out of my presence."</p><p>Upon hearing his words, several guards immediately approached Anping Marquis. The latter was not surprised and merely said, "I'll leave by myself."</p><p>However, the guards were determined, even to the point of not uttering an apology as they restrained Anping Marquis and escorted him away like a prisoner.</p><p>"Let go!"</p><p>Anping Marquis struggled a bit. Despite his strength as a grown man, the well-trained guards made sure no one could escape. They forcibly took him downstairs.</p><p>In the midst of all eyes, Marquis Anping was particularly vain. After realizing his predicament, Marquis Anping struggled once more.</p><p>He was merely being chased out.</p><p>Marquis Anping silently repeated in his heart and finally regained some of his former composure. He was dragged outside the tavern by the guards. Marquis Anping hid his anger and only said with restrained bitterness, "You should let go now."</p><p>In the next moment, the guards released him, but they suddenly kicked him in the knee, causing Marquis Anping to fall to the ground.</p><p>No matter what Marquis Anping said, he was a marquis who had never been treated so before. After a brief moment of shock, he became enraged and shouted, "You dare! Let go right now!"</p><p>"I thought that merely chasing you out was enough," Xue Fangli looked down at him condescendingly, "Marquis, you should properly apologize."</p><p>The expression on Marquis Anping's face changed.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing did not adhere to the etiquette between monarch and minister. Therefore, Marquis Anping rarely knelt before Emperor Hongxing. Now, he was forced to kneel on the ground in front of everyone, facing Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli, as if kneeling to them or for someone else.</p><p>His title had been bestowed upon him by Emperor Hongxing's imperial decree, but at this moment, Marquis Anping was pressed to his knees before everyone because King Li wanted him to apologize to Jiang Juan.</p><p>Marquis Anping felt deeply humiliated. His hands slowly clenched into fists, but Xue Fangli ignored it, only smiling and saying, "Marquis, apologize."</p><p>Passersby outside the tavern looked in curiosity, while guests inside stared at him intently. Many eyes fell upon Marquis Anping as if they were real.</p><p>He had experienced humiliation before, but never like this.</p><p>Anger and resentment raged in his heart. Marquis Anping knew he should be restrained, but—</p><p>This was King Li, the king who repeatedly humiliated him.</p><p>And Jiang Juan, who toyed with him and humiliated him along with King Li.</p><p>His dignity shattered, Marquis Anping opened his mouth and finally spoke the words he had been keeping inside for so long.</p><p>"— Li Wang, you really overstep the bounds!"</p><p>"Why should I apologize?" Duke of Anping said angrily. "What's my mistake in scolding this queen?"</p><p>"He knows technique and has a good head on his shoulders but lacks any sense of shame! All he does is bully people with power, oppress the common folk!"</p><p>Duke of Anping spoke grandly as if he were telling an audience about the righteous act of condemning Jiang Juan. However, in reality, he was just venting his hatred.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>Having been inexplicably berated, Jiang Juan felt bewildered and responded indifferently, "What are you talking about? How have I bullied anyone with power?"</p><p>Before he could argue back, Xue Fangli gently pinched Jiang Juan's finger, signaling him to stay silent. Xue Fangli said coldly, "Is my queen someone you can speak ill of?"</p><p>"What he excels at the most is bullying people with power. Since you insist on accusing him of that, I will show you precisely what bullying with power means."</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly said, "Bring me the palm striker."</p><p>Duke of Anping was shaken and raised his head with disbelief. The next second, there was a slap, and a guard delivered a heavy blow to his face. Duke of Anping was stunned.</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Duke of Anping, how do you feel now?"</p><p>Duke of Anping: "H..."</p><p>Another slap came, knocking Duke of Anping's head to one side and interrupting his words.</p><p>"Slap, slap, slap—!"</p><p>The slaps continued relentlessly. Soon, Duke of Anping's face was disoriented with red marks all over it. He struggled continuously but was held down tightly by the guards. Although he felt immensely humiliated in his heart, he gritted his teeth and tried to finish his sentence.</p><p>"How could he bully..."</p><p>"Snap——!"</p><p>The guards were all martial arts experts, putting their full strength into it. No matter what Duke Ping tried to say, he was always interrupted and couldn't even form a complete sentence.</p><p>At this moment, Duke Ping looked pathetic. The patrons in the tavern knew of the situation; in their eyes, Duke Ping still held his honor despite the defeat.</p><p>Tormented to such an extent, he also bitterly condemned Concubine Li for using her power to bully people!</p><p>Duke Ping was truly virtuous and righteous.</p><p>Concubine Li, as the king's concubine, was indeed too arrogant!</p><p>The storyteller had no exception; he felt this way too.</p><p>But just at that moment, not long after the storyteller started his tale, the guard whom Schue Fangli dismissed returned upstairs. "Your Highness, I've asked the manager. They are aware," Schue Fangli whispered.</p><p>At the same time, the tavern's manager pulled over the storyteller and told him a shocking thing with fear. In the next moment, something unexpected happened!</p><p>"Concubine! Thank you, Concubine——!"</p><p>The storyteller's heart pounded wildly. After hearing it all, he felt his limbs go weak. He yelled out loud and practically crawled upstairs to kneel down in front of Jiang Juan's feet, "Plop," crawling on the ground, "Your Excellency, you are truly kind-hearted! I am short-sighted for not recognizing your greatness earlier!"</p><p>It turned out that this young man stopped him from telling the story not because he was arrogant and impulsive, but due to a hidden reason.</p><p>This story was not about something from the previous dynasty or a fictional tale, but rather——</p><p>something confidential from the palace of the Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>The storyteller was dumbfounded. After the manager mentioned it, he almost immediately understood.</p><p>Since this story wasn't fictitious and was about events during the Zhou Dynasty, then that madman must be...</p><p>Leaving the King!? </p><p>No wonder the Queen Consort kept intercepting him.</p><p>No wonder the Queen Consort &#59393;&#8204;allowed him to continue speaking.</p><p>The Queen Consort was actually trying to save his life.</p><p>He was actually&#60116;&#8204;speaking in front of the King about how he was insane and disregarding human ethics?</p><p>If it weren't for the Queen Consort's intervention, if he had continued speaking, he would have surely been executed today!</p><p>The storyteller grew increasingly fearful as he recalled what happened, feeling more and more grateful. He said with relief, "Thank you, Your Excellency, the Queen Consort, for saving my life. I recognize your kindness; I know Your Excellency's good intentions!"</p><p>Having finished his sentence, the storyteller hurriedly bowed to the guests at the inn, defending Jiang Juan by saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, do not misunderstand Your Excellency, the Queen Consort. She allowed me to continue telling the story because of the circumstances, not because she was taking advantage of her position. The Queen Consort——"</p><p>"Just had good intentions!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>What kind of good intentions? What saved his life?</p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt bewildered. Whenever he faced a decision, he would ask the King for advice, and that's what he did this time as well. He asked softly, "Your Majesty, what did he say?"</p><p>The storyteller was relieved, but Xue Fangli understood clearly. This man truly had reason to feel relieved.</p><p>If Jiang Juan hadn't been there, regardless of how the storyteller came to know about the story, they would have sewn his mouth shut, preventing him from making a living by telling stories or spreading this tale.</p><p>But these things, Xue Fangli wouldn't tell Jiang Juan. He merely said lightly, "Of course."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "oh," the Prince said, bǐng huì, then it must be something very important.</p><p>Jiang Juan realized this, but the guests in the tavern were still máng rán, zhān rán, not just them, even Duke of Anping was stunned for a moment and then his eyes widened in fury.</p><p>This storyteller is actually so bǐng huì!</p><p>I helped him out and came here, yet he didn’t say a word of gratitude but turned to be grateful to Jiang Juan?</p><p>What did he become?</p><p>He suffered humiliation for nothing, becoming a laughingstock!?</p><p>Duke of Anping felt his blood boil, nearly vomiting. He swayed, putting both hands on the ground, veins popping out.</p><p>But this was not over yet.</p><p>Jīng huò zhī duǎn, outside the tavern someone knocked loudly on the dà mén, it turned out to be a few soldiers.</p><p>"Sir official, what’s going on here?"</p><p>The manager smiled and asked. After the leader of the soldiers showed his token, he asked, "Is Duke of Anping here?"</p><p>"S-S-Sir."</p><p>The manager hesitated before lowering his head. The soldiers followed him, this was so alarming that everyone jumped in fright.</p><p>A mighty duke, kneeling with disheveled hair on the ground, face swollen red, could no longer show any former glory, even worse than a beggar!</p><p>"What’s … going on?"</p><p>The leader of the soldiers looked around and suddenly noticed Xue Fangli. He immediately guessed what happened about six or seven tenths.</p><p>It seems that the Marquis had offended the Prince again.</p><p>Why is it said "again"?</p><p>The soldiers bowed to Lord Anping, "My lord, a woman reported that you smashed her jade pendant and ran away. Please go with us to the courthouse."</p><p>This woman was not an ordinary woman; she was a prostitute. Under normal circumstances, the authorities would not take the complaint of a prostitute seriously, especially since she was accusing Lord Anping. Moreover, this prostitute held a token from Prince Li, so the authorities could no longer ignore her claim.</p><p>It is easy to guess that Prince Li, who is not known for his kindness, would give a prostitute such a token only if he had been offended by Lord Anping.</p><p>The soldiers' words caused a stir in the room!</p><p>Lord Anping smashed someone else's jade pendant and even ran away?</p><p>And the other party was a weak woman?</p><p>How could that be possible?</p><p>Lord Anping is known for his gentlemanly behavior, having learned some true teachings from Mr. Bai. He understands etiquette, knows it, and follows it; how could he bully a weak woman?</p><p>Everyone expressed doubts about this claim. Lord Anping became enraged upon hearing this, biting his teeth, "What are you saying?"</p><p>"When have I done such a thing?"</p><p>A guard reminded him, "My lord, you have a good memory but forget many things. Didn't you take a jade pendant from the Crown Prince and then smash it?"</p><p>"This jade pendant is——"</p><p>Lord Anping remembered and tried to defend himself, but his words suddenly stopped.</p><p>He had intended to say that this jade pendant was a token of his trust.</p><p>Ke Yùpèi was originally in Jiàng Juàn's hands, and then he gave it to someone else, ultimately ending up with a dancer. Indeed, it was all because of him...</p><p>He smashed someone else's jade pendant.</p><p>Duke Ping of An was stunned.</p><p>"Your Excellency, please."</p><p>The soldiers bowed politely, not treating him like an ordinary prisoner by rushing forward to apprehend him, but rather giving him due respect.</p><p>Even so, Duke Ping of An neither harshly rebuked the soldiers for their lies nor refuted a single word, thus proving that the matter was true.</p><p>Duke Ping of An actually bullied a defenseless woman!</p><p>He smashed someone else's jade pendant and abandoned it heedlessly, leading to someone lodging a complaint with the authorities!</p><p>No matter how unbelievable, at this moment, even those who had praised him just moments ago accepted this reality.</p><p>Duke Ping of An was indeed a fake gentleman.</p><p>He condemned Consort Wang for using her influence to bully people, yet in the end, he himself used his influence to bully someone!</p><p>After Duke Ping of An was taken away, it was the leading soldier. Before leaving, he remembered to go upstairs and respectfully presented an item: "Your Highness, your token."</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with a "hum" and put it away. He said coolly, "You guys sure came at just the right time."</p><p>Indeed, they came at the right time, arriving just as Consort Wang was there to restrain Duke Ping of An. Before setting out, the soldiers had prepared to take Duke Ping of An away but ended up being punished by him, after all, when gods fight, mortals suffer. They were the unfortunate ones caught in the middle, and yet—</p><p>It turned out to be a waste of effort.</p><p>"If not for Your Highness, I would have been troubled today."</p><p>The soldiers sighed in relief. Schue Fangli did not show any concern and said lazily, "Investigate the case thoroughly, impose penalties where due, and for compensation—by this King's judgment, that woman seems rather pitiable; if Lord Hou were to double his repayment."</p><p>Since the Prince had made his statement clear, the soldiers naturally nodded in agreement. "Of course, Your Highness is right. That woman was indeed pitiful; it was fortunate that she met you and received your token of authority."</p><p>"Prince, are you truly... rescuing people at random and offering help?"</p><p>The soldiers only said some polite words, but even so, they found it quite difficult to say this about Prince Li. After all, describing him in such a manner felt almost surreal.</p><p>Schue Fangli's expression changed. "This King merely saw someone using their influence to bully others."</p><p>"..."</p><p>He seemed at a loss for words and was also baffled by how naturally Prince Li could utter such words.</p><p>Jiang Juan remembered Schue Fangli from that time and linked it with previous events, finally realizing the situation.</p><p>Before they left the Crown Prince's residence, Jiang Juan felt pity for the dancer, so the Prince gave him his token of authority and winked at him. Only then did Jiang Juan understand what the Prince had in mind.</p><p>—If Lord Anping broke Xue's jade pendant and refused to compensate, let the government punish him.</p><p>No matter how Jiang Juan thought about it, he felt that the Prince was a kind person, kind to him and others alike—seemingly oblivious to their true natures—the dancer or storyteller, were merely benefiting from his influence.</p><p>Jiang Juan squinted his eyes in agreement. "Mm, you're right. The Prince has a good heart; he is willing to help those who are bullied."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"??" </p><p>A good heart? Willing to help?</p><p>The soldiers' faces showed a trace of cracking.</p><p>It wasn't just him; the storyteller standing close by also had an instant of daze.</p><p>No matter what, today's events were full of twists and turns, with an unpredictable ending that was like being shrouded in fog. However, two things were crystal clear.</p><p>First, Duke Ping's treatment of a weak woman was truly despicable!</p><p>No matter how he pretended to be courteous and polite, his true colors were revealed; one can indeed know a person by their actions!</p><p>Secondly,</p><p>Duke Li, with his authority to grant life or death, his tyrannical and capricious nature, and his imposing demeanor—why was it that when he returned to the palace, he became fearful of his wife!?</p><p>Let him leave if he wants to.</p>
