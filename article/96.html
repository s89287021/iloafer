						<p>Junge, that little slut was getting dressed. You could use your powerful purchasing power to drive her out. He never dared to meet anyone's gaze, let alone interact with others. In the capital, he was ridiculed by all except Jiang Nian, who knew that this hateful Third Son was actually extremely handsome.</p><p>He often secretly watched Jiang Nian with a look filled with envy and longing.</p><p>This face should have been beautiful, but his self-loathing and gloom had sapped much of its charm. But now, it was completely transformed. Jiang Juan seemed to have undergone a metamorphosis.</p><p>His gaze was pure, almost otherworldly in beauty, yet untouched by the vulgarity of human society, as if he came from the Jade Pool.</p><p>While one's appearance could be altered temporarily with external means, could a person's temperament and character change so rapidly?</p><p>It was impossible, completely impossible.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Jiang Nian suddenly remembered something and widened his eyes.</p><p>Could it be that Jiang Juan had also been reborn?</p><p>No, that couldn't be possible.</p><p>Jiang Nian quickly dismissed this terrifying thought.</p><p>But how could Jiang Juan have changed so drastically?</p><p>And why did he sit calmly in Li Wang's arms without a trace of fear or unease, as if he had no idea of this man's brutality?</p><p>Jiang Nian couldn't figure it out.</p><p>Of course, there was another thing he found even more perplexing.</p><p>-- How could King Li be willing to hold Jiang Juan in his arms?</p><p>This time, does he not mind getting his hands dirty?</p><p>Jiang Nian stared at Jiang Juan intently for a long time before smiling and saying, "Princess Wang."</p><p>In the end, it was the main character who received attention. Jiang Juan politely responded, "Mm, big brother, you're here."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and then explained to him, "I made you wait so long just now, it's all my fault--"</p><p>Not knowing how to say it without coming across as an antagonist taunting him, Jiang Juan faltered. Xue Fangli saw the situation and calmly said, "He was sleeping, and this king did not order anyone to report it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>It seemed rather arrogant.</p><p>He gently tugged on Xue Fangli's sleeve, shook his head, indicating that he didn't need him to do anything. Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan but showed no reaction.</p><p>What was he so nervous about?</p><p>Even he wasn't afraid, yet facing this second son, he was this nervous.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>This fell upon Jiang Nian's eyes as having another meaning.</p><p>-- He was displeased.</p><p>At this moment, King Li had no expression on his face and did not say anything, finally allowing Jiang Nian to find some solace in himself.</p><p>No matter how favored one was, it was still just about being favored.</p><p>Look, even a tiny gesture could make the King unhappy?</p><p>Jiang Nian felt a sense of vindictive pleasure and lost his usual composure. "Brother, with the Prince protecting you like this, why do you complain about him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "I didn't."</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled slightly. "Then—"</p><p>He suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyelids, staring at Jiang Nian with a smile that was hard to read.</p><p>The same look as in his previous life.</p><p>Arrogant and aloof. The man was smiling, but there was no trace of warmth in his eyes. He looked at Jiang Nian lazily, as if he could see all the ugliness in Jiang Nian's heart and was mocking him.</p><p>Jiang Nian hated him, and he was also genuinely afraid of him.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat, his face turned pale, and he lowered his head, managing a weak smile. "... I spoke out of turn."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang frowned. Jiang Nian had always been gentle and courteous; the words that had just stirred up trouble were not something he would say. However, Shangshu Jiang did not think much about it and assumed that after waiting so long, Jiang Nian was simply unhappy.</p><p>Shangshu Jiang felt quite frustrated.</p><p>He had planned to scold Jiang Juan for his behavior, but Xue Fangli was also there. He could only temporarily hold back his anger.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Shangshu Jiang respectfully said, "Your Highness, we came to visit the Princess Consort. We just have some casual talk. You can do your own thing and don't need to accompany us."</p><p>"I have nothing much to do. I just came to visit the Princess Consort, not because I knew Lord Jiang was coming and decided to accompany him," Xue Fangli glanced at him with a smile. "Lord Jiang, you needn't worry."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang choked.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli continued, "Since it's just some casual talk, Lord Jiang can be as relaxed as he wishes. When this King is not around."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang: "... "</p><p>How could one be so relaxed with the Prince sitting there? How dare he be so relaxed?</p><p>He shouldn't have come here in the first place.</p><p>Shangshu Jiang regretted it deeply.</p><p>But since he had already come and his words were out, being cautious of Xue Fangli, Shangshu Jiang stifled his anger and forced a smile. He asked Jiang Juan gently, "Where did you get hurt?"</p><p>The change in attitude was too sudden, making Jiang Juan look at him curiously. After a long while, she finally replied, "... My foot."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang's smile froze. Suppressing his anger, he asked politely, "How did you get hurt?"</p><p>Jiang Juan evaded the question, saying, "I twisted my ankle accidentally."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang and Jiang Juan were not close; they didn't have much to talk about on a daily basis. After asking about her injury, Shangshu Jiang didn't know what else to say. He fell into an awkward silence.</p><p>"Why did you stop talking?" Xue Fangli asked leisurely, "Is that it?"</p><p>"There's still more," Shangshu Jiang forced a smile and said, "Little Nian, you two have always had a good relationship. Do you have anything to say?"</p><p>Jiang Nian looked dazed and didn't hear Shangshu Jiang calling him. Seeing this, Shangshu Jiang could only pretend again and said to Jiang Juan, "You can't go back home tomorrow. Once your foot injury is healed, be sure to come back and visit. Everyone at home misses you."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't stupid; she responded insincerely, "Okay, okay."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang pretended to be worried and said, "By the way, a broken bone or muscle injury takes a hundred days to recover from. You need to take good care of your foot wound so that you don't develop any chronic illness in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "You're right."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang: "..."</p><p>He was straining his brain here, and Jiang Juan was almost fooling him right into his face. Shangshu Jiang nearly fainted from frustration. He then scowled and said, "You——"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Xue Fangli opened his eyes and casually remarked, "Lord Shangshu, the King says whatever he wants when he's not around, doesn't mean you can be so casual."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang stared at him, feeling a chill run down his spine. He remained stiff for a while before softly addressing Jiang Juan, "Are your heart troubles flaring up again? It's hot; you need to take care of yourself, don't seek the cool, and even less..."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang started rambling on, partly out of social courtesy. Initially, Jiang Juan tried to fake interest in his words but gradually became more and more drowsy, her eyelids growing heavier until she could no longer pretend.</p><p>—She fell asleep in Xue Fangli's arms.</p><p>Shangshu Jiang: "..."</p><p>This made him even angrier.</p><p>But he dared not voice his anger and could only grit his teeth as he suppressed the rising fury within him. He then lowered his voice and asked Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, since Lady Jue is tired, I will take my leave so as not to disturb her rest."</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent for a long time before finally replying slowly, "Lord Shangshu speaks the truth."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang: "?"</p><p>Xue Fangli continued, "Bring in someone to see off our guest."</p><p>Shangshu Jiang clenched his teeth tightly. Regardless of what happened, they had managed to escape.</p><p>After being escorted out of the villa, Shangshu Jiang felt that even the air was unusually fresh. He said with a sour expression, "Your Highness sure does protect him."</p><p>Jiang Nian did not want to admit it, only mumbling, "The Prince should have just been in a moment of whimsy."</p><p>This man was the most heartless.</p><p>Even though he now pampered and protected Jiang Juan, how long could this affection last?</p><p>There would be no exception.</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>Jiang Nian took a deep breath, repeating to himself over and over.</p><p>——Li is far from a good match for the Prince, but Duke of Anping is.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Nian felt like seeing the Duke of Anping, so he said to Jiang Shushu, "Father, I want to visit the Marquisate."</p><p>Hearing him mention the marquisate, Jiang Shushu asked, "The Marquis mentioned a few days ago that he wanted to go into the palace to request the imperial marriage. Has it been granted?"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook his head, "He hasn't told me yet; he should still be at home."</p><p>"If not for his uncle, you two would have already become engaged," Jiang Shushu snorted, "Back then, being a bit arrogant was fine. But what about Mr. Bai's top disciple? You've been well-read since childhood, and he looked down on you but favored Jiang Juan."</p><p>Jiang Nian forced a smile, "Mr. Bai is renowned worldwide and revered by all. Sir Chamao has inherited his true teachings; perhaps I truly lack in some way compared to my brother."</p><p>"How could that be possible," Jiang Shushu disagreed, "By the way, the Eldest Princess will return to the capital soon, and his uncle should also be back. Let the Marquis go into the palace to settle it as soon as possible."</p><p>Jiang Nian nodded, "Alright."</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Jiang Nian couldn't help but ask about what had long puzzled him, "Father, where did my brother's engagement with the Marquis actually come from?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu replied, "It was settled between his grandfather and Sir Chamao."</p><p>Jiang Nian said in surprise, "Isn't that an old man who lives in the countryside? How could he know the Marquis?"</p><p>Jiang Shushu remembered vaguely, "It seemed to be said that he saved the Marquis's life once. I didn't inquire further."</p><p>Jiang Nian said with a troubled mind, "So that's how it is..."</p><p>Inside the pavilion, Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched slightly as if he was starting to wake up. His eyes hadn't opened yet, but he had already started working diligently, "Mm, you're right."</p><p>Senior Clerk nearly burst into laughter beside him. Schue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan in his arms and quickly suppressed it, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>In his opinion, being deceived was more infuriating than being directly offended or ignored. Unfortunately, their Empress Consort didn't seem to realize this.</p><p>The Empress Consort is really a remarkable person.</p><p>Senior Clerk sighed deeply.</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly opened his eyes and found that Jiang Shushu and Jiang Nian were not there. He said bewilderedly, "Where are they?"</p><p>Schue Fangli replied, "They left after you fell asleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh," and the next second, he thought of something, causing his body to stiffen.</p><p>Had I offended the main character three times in a row?</p><p>I even fell asleep while talking about it.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He really was a villain who kept jumping onto the main character's pain points, Jiang Juan sighed sorrowfully.</p><p>Schue Fangli asked him, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said dazedly, "In the future, I must be more careful in my dealings with people."</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan remembered that Xue Fangli was also quite flamboyant in his behavior. He then said to Xue Fangli, "Your Highness, you should be careful too and not offend people randomly anymore."</p><p>The young man just woke up from a long sleep, his eyes bright and moist, and his voice soft. Xue Fangli looked down at him; he was about to sneer, but instead, he only smiled and said, "Alright."</p><p>Wang Zongguan quickly invited him to rest in the pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion was surrounded by a lake on three sides, with green lotus leaves floating on the water's surface. Jiang Juan leaned over the railing to catch the breeze; it wasn't hot yet, so the natural wind felt very pleasant.</p><p>He wondered what he would do when summer arrived. There would be no cola, and there definitely wouldn't be an air conditioner.</p><p>Thinking of this made Jiang Juan feel a bit dejected again.</p><p>He let his hands hang down, resting his head on his arm. The wide sleeves were lifted by the wind, revealing a small portion of his wrist, which should have been snow-white but instead bore several red finger marks.</p>
