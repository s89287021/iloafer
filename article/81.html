						<p>Snow White Morning?</p><p>Is he the grandson of Snow White Morning?</p><p>Jiang Juan: "??"</p><p>In the original text, Snow White Morning never officially appeared, but whenever anyone mentioned him, they showed deep reverence for this elderly man as if he were a saint.</p><p>Later on, even the main character Shou and Duke Ping An wanted to invite him out of retirement, but Snow White Morning always remained unseen, leaving Shou and Duke Ping An disappointed.</p><p>When Jiang Juan saw this part, she found it quite strange. After all, no one should be able to resist the aura of the main character, and Duke Ping An had even received guidance from Snow White Morning, yet Snow White Morning ignored them both.</p><p>Now Jiang Juan seems to understand.</p><p>According to the plot, the reason why the character with the same name as him committed suicide by biting his tongue was unrelated to Duke Ping An and Shou. Therefore, this elderly man did not come out of retirement and refused to see them.</p><p>After all, they were his grandson. No matter how saint-like Snow White Morning appeared, he was still a human being and could not tolerate any grudges.</p><p>Jiang Juan understands the reasoning, but—</p><p>Snow White Morning is actually her grandfather!</p><p>He is actually such an old grandfather!?</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned.</p><p>She was stunned, and Sir Li was also shocked.</p><p>"What? He is...?"</p><p>Sir Li struggled to speak, "Your Majesty, how can that be? Mr. Bai is not..."</p><p>He first lashed out with a tirade, seemingly implying that the Princess Consort had been raised in the countryside and received good education, lacking any sense of decorum, hence unworthy to be a Crown Princess. However, now—</p><p>the man who raised him turned out to be Mr. Bai!</p><p>Who was Mr. Bai?</p><p>When Emperor Hongxing inquired about this, how did he respond?</p><p>—Mr. Bai is upright and noble, with the soul as pure as ice and snow. His descendants must also have excellent backgrounds and characters.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Prefect Li was at a loss for words.</p><p>The words he had spoken earlier seemed like a slap to his face. Prefect Li opened his mouth but remained in shock, "How can that be?"</p><p>"Your Majesty, are you joking?"</p><p>Someone then spoke with a trembling voice. This time, the one speaking out of turn was none other than Secretary Jiang. Prefect Li was stunned, and Secretary Jiang's astonishment was no less. After all—</p><p>if Secretary Jiang Juan's grandfather were indeed Bai Xuechao, then wouldn't Bai Xuechao be his father-in-law?</p><p>Yet he had no knowledge of this!</p><p>During his tenure, he encountered bandits and was wounded. He was eventually rescued by a peasant girl. The woman was rather pretty, and after spending some time together, Prefect Jiang developed feelings for her. She reluctantly complied with him.</p><p>In Prefect Jiang's mind, it was merely a fleeting affair, so when he later learned that the woman had died of heart disease, he didn't take it to heart. He even paid little attention to the son she bore—Jiang Juan—who was fostered by her father.</p><p>But now, Emperor Hongxing claimed that Jiang Juan was Bai Xuechao's grandson!</p><p>Did this mean that the peasant girl was actually Bai Xuechao's daughter?</p><p>How could this be? Chancellor Jiang was incredulous as he said to the Emperor, "Your Majesty, if what you say is true... Mr. Bai... is actually my father-in-law? Why didn't I know about this?"</p><p>"My lord, you are truly foolish."</p><p>Chancellor Jiang looked at him blankly and suddenly recalled many details that he had previously overlooked.</p><p>Back then, when Duke of Anping called off the engagement and forced Lady Jiang Juan to remarry Duke Li, Chancellor Jiang had also played a role. He and Duke of Anping went to the palace to meet with Emperor Hongxing. The emperor seemed reluctant but agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>—"Since that's the case, let's send her to the prince's mansion on the originally scheduled date. The wedding attire hasn't been made in time, and Lao Wu also liked Xijing. Perhaps this child will be inconvenienced."</p><p>At that time, Chancellor Jiang thought the date was set and changing it midway would not be good; failing to marry on the day would also be problematic. It was only then that Emperor Hongxing relented under duress. Now he recalled...</p><p>Was Your Majesty afraid that things might change over time?</p><p>Chancellor Jiang once loathed this son.</p><p>He resented his mother for lacking self-respect, criticized him for growing up in the countryside, disliked his gloomy disposition, and above all, hated that he—</p><p>Had arranged such a good marriage without going through him.</p><p>It turned out that his father-in-law was Snow White.</p><p>So it was.</p><p>Chancellor Jiang's feelings were complicated.</p><p>His current father-in-law had provided him with much help and promoted him several times, leading to his current position of rank three. But if his father-in-law was indeed Snow White—</p><p>He is bound to rise to the top and reach even greater heights!</p><p>Prefect Jiang suddenly felt immense regret.</p><p>How foolish he had been!</p><p>It seemed like a farce. After learning that Bai Xue Chao was Prefect Jiang's grandfather, everything fell back into place, and Emperor Hongxing proceeded with the ancestral rites.</p><p>This time, Manager Wang sent someone to bring new incense, so there should be no more mishaps.</p><p>The emperor had offered sacrifices last year, and since this ceremony also marked the announcement of the crown prince, the rituals were not overly complicated. After a single hour, the rites were completed.</p><p>Jiang Juan was led away from the altar but remained in a daze.</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Manager Wang heard and said with a smile, "You should change your way of addressing me."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, "Crown Prince?"</p><p>He had been used to calling him "Prince," so it felt strange to call him "Crown Prince." Xue Fangli glanced at him but did not say anything; he merely nodded and asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered, "It feels like a dream."</p><p>Since Chapter Three where Wang Ye lived, the plot had fallen apart one after another, always giving him surprises. Now, Wang Ye was the crown prince, and he even had an illustrious grandfather.</p><p>"I have a big backer now."</p><p>Xue Fangli misunderstood him and spoke in a calm tone, "I told you earlier—"</p><p>Before he could finish, Jiang Juan said joyfully, "Prince, if you can't be crown prince anymore in the future, come back to my hometown with me and seek refuge under my grandfather. He's reliable."</p><p>Lián the main character and Anping Marquis both had to eat from his elder's leftovers.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, pinched a piece of soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face, and asked with a smile that wasn't quite a smile: "Do you think this king is dead?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was bewildered, "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was not pleasant. "Is this king not your protector?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He quickly changed his words and said in what seemed to be a more sincere tone: "Yes, Your Highness, you are also."</p><p>Xue Fangli sneered, but did not release Jiang Juan's face as he asked in a calm voice: "Who makes you feel safer, this king or your grandfather?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Is this a question of life and death?</p><p>Jiang Juan asked bitterly: "Your Highness, are all the Xues very competitive for victory?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly. "What do you think?"</p><p>For some reason, the king's smile was gentle and courteous, but Jiang Juan always felt danger lurking. His instinct for survival made him blurt out without hesitation: "Your Highness, of course it is Your Highness!"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, seemingly much more satisfied, and Jiang Juan heaved a sigh of relief. The head steward, Wang, was overjoyed to see this and said excitedly: "His Highness the Crown Prince, you..."</p><p>As they descended from the altar, Xue Fangli gave him a glance, and Wang finally followed after them. This was a good opportunity, so he hurriedly asked: "Did Your Highness summon your servant for something?"</p><p>Xue Fangli took out an incense stick, broke it in half, but the incense core was soaked.</p><p>Manager Wang was shocked, "T-this... the sacrificial ceremony to honor our ancestors is of great importance. How dare someone tamper with it!"</p><p>Xue Fangli joined in, but since this was something related to Emperor Hongxing, he didn't want to get involved and instead asked Jiang Juan, "Return home?"</p><p>Jiang Juan, however, pointed at a pagoda, "Prince Wang, what is this pagoda?"</p><p>"Mirror Flower Tower."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at it and said calmly, "Want to go up?"</p><p>Manager Wang also looked over but provided more details, "This is a thousand-year-old Buddhist pagoda that houses a relic. Legend has it that if one kneels and prays all the way up to the thirty-seventh level, the true Buddha will appear."</p><p>Jiang Juan was speechless, "Thirty-seven levels? That's so high, I can barely climb it, let alone kneel and pray my way up."</p><p>Manager Wang shook his head, "Where there is a heart's desire, don't say thirty-seven levels. Even three hundred seventy levels would be done by people praying."</p><p>Jiang Juan found the idea terrifying just thinking about it. He said to Xue Fangli, "Prince Wang, I want to see this tower."</p><p>Since he wanted to go, Xue Fangli naturally accompanied him. Just as Jiang Juan was about to take a step, Xue Fangli was stopped by someone.</p><p>"Prince Wang! Prince Wang!"</p><p>Xue Fangli turned around and saw a servant who whispered something. Jiang Juan caught a few key words.</p><p>Teahouse, storyteller, beggars, etc.</p><p>The prince must still be investigating the story of the storyteller, thought Jiang Juan for a moment before he couldn't wait any longer. He said, "Prince Wang, I'll go into the tower first."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and was initially reluctant to let Jiang Juan leave but seeing how bored he looked, finally nodded.</p><p>Jiang Juan rarely enjoyed going out on his own initiative, especially for climbing a pagoda, but this Buddhist pagoda genuinely piqued his curiosity. Soon enough, Jiang Juan arrived at the tower and looked up as he climbed level by level.</p><p>The wooden ladder was narrow, and Jiang Juan moved slowly as he swayed along the river. The guards following him also walked haltingly. With so many people gathered together, Jiang Juan thought for a moment and said, "You guys go up first."</p><p>He shooed the guards upstairs and stopped at the fifth floor, unwilling to climb any higher. Jiang Juan started wandering around; most of the interior of the pagoda consisted of vibrant wall paintings depicting the faithful bowing floor by floor. Jiang Juan was not very interested in them. He headed towards the observation deck, hoping not to see the prince.</p><p>"Clomp—"</p><p>Before he could go far, footsteps suddenly echoed in the quiet pagoda. Jiang Juan jumped in surprise and turned back, only to find no one there.</p><p>Was it a guard?</p><p>Jiang Juan was not too concerned and took another step outside.</p><p>"Pilgrim, would you like to draw a slip of paper?"</p><p>Suddenly, someone spoke. Jiang Juan turned around to see an old monk dressed in tattered robes with emaciated bones walking up the stairs. He held a bamboo tube in one hand and pulled a dirty little monk by the other.</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not want to draw a slip of paper, but the old monk whispered something to the little monk, who then ran over holding the bamboo tube. The little monk stumbled and nearly fell, so Jiang Juan caught him and helped steady the bamboo tube. With a clatter, one of the bamboo slips fell out.</p><p>The old monk was satisfied and said, "Pilgrim, please come quickly; let this humble monk interpret your slip for you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Was this a scam?</p><p>Jiang Juan felt his throat constricting. It was the little monk who tugged on Jiang Juan's hand, moving it back and forth when he saw that Jiang Juan did not move. Jiang Juan lowered his head, and the little monk whispered softly, "Father is very good at interpreting slips."</p><p>Whether or not it was accurate, Jiang Juan was not too concerned. However, both the old and young monks were severely emaciated. He sighed and decided to participate in the scam, returning from the observation deck to inside the pagoda.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The old monk saw the situation and laughed with his teeth showing, "Donor, let me take a look at it—eh? You got the bottom lot, your luck isn’t too good."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>Alright then.</p><p>"Your life is extremely auspicious, you could be said to have a wealthy fate, but destiny has decreed three calamities for you. The first calamity, you were already hanging by a thread, but fortune took a turn. The second calamity… phew, it was dangerous."</p><p>The old monk rolled his eyes, "It’s not that it can’t be resolved, but—"</p><p>"Give me some silver coins?"</p><p>The old monk waved his hand, "No."</p><p>"Wealth is an external possession," the old monk said enigmatically, "Donor, if you truly want to completely resolve it, there is only one way—follow this poor monk on a path of cultivation."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>Cultivation is so arduous, Jiang Juan wouldn’t have it, but why didn’t the old monk take his silver coins and instead dragged him into cultivation? Jiang Juan strangely asked him, "Does your temple lack monks that much?"</p><p>The old monk glanced at him and was still laughing, "This poor monk has more to say. If you are truly attached to worldly pleasures, there is a lower option—"</p><p>He twirled his fingers, his gaze rather calculating, "Spend money to dissipate the calamity."</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>Jiang Juan took a glance at him, "Do you know who I am?"</p><p>The old monk scrutinized Jiang Juan for a few moments and then smirked, "Venerable, you are blessed with a life of wealth and honor. You will surely become the golden branch and jade leaf, a wealthy household."</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly asked him, "Can you be more specific?"</p><p>It seemed as though the old monk was caught off guard by his question. He said hesitantly, "Venerable, this humble monk can only give you a general impression."</p><p>Jiang Juan inquired further, "If you can only give me a general impression, will you resolve my troubles only partially? Wouldn’t that mean I’ve wasted my silver coins?"</p><p>The old monk defended himself vehemently, "Venerable, one should not speak like this. You have calamities in your destiny. Even if they are resolved partially, the most dangerous parts will be dealt with. The rest you can easily overcome."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not believe him and thought it was all an excuse, "Deceiver."</p><p>The old monk grew agitated, "Venerable, do not defame this humble monk without reason. Although I cannot discern your identity, I can see other things."</p><p>Jiang Juan gave him another chance, "What can you see?"</p><p>The old monk asked him, "Are you unusually fond of sleeping?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback; he did love to sleep. He pressed on, "And then?"</p><p>The old monk spoke in a mysterious tone, "This is due to your weak physique and unstable spirit!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>It seemed the old monk had said something or perhaps nothing at all.</p><p>With his congenital deficiency, it was natural for him to have a weak physique. It could be seen from his sunken eyes, after all, he looked sickly with no hint of color on his face. As for his unstable spirit, it was probably just the old monk’s attempt to mystify things.</p><p>Jiang Juan responded insincerely, "Mmm, what you say is very enlightening."</p><p>The old monk seemed satisfied after hearing half of Jiang Juan's response and boasted, "As I said, this humble monk is not a deceiver."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not want to engage in idle chatter with him anymore, so she asked the old monk, "Do you know about Li Wang?"</p><p>Not mentioning Li Wang was fine; upon hearing his name, the old monk immediately shuddered. With a grim face, he said, "Sir, why would you mention this living Yama? It's ominous."</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly replied, "Sorry, but the living Yama in your words is my husband. Can't even figure that out?"</p><p>Old Monk: "... "</p><p>Old Monk: "........"</p><p>His expression changed drastically, and he immediately pulled on the young monk to run away. Jiang Juan said slowly, "Don't go. You still have to dispel the calamity for me. If you run now, I'll make sure it's not pleasant for you."</p><p>Whether it was because Wang Ye was too powerful or because of her threat of displeasure, the old monk immediately stopped in his tracks, turned his head with a gloomy expression, and said with difficulty, "Originally, Your Majesty, this humble monk did not recognize a jade mountain... did not recognize a jade mountain."</p><p>Taking a moment, the old monk tried to find an excuse for himself. He muttered, "Your Majesty, look, I said you had a life of prosperity, and it turned out true, didn't it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him, "Are you sure you want to continue lying?"</p><p>The old monk remained silent for a few seconds before admitting honestly, "Your Majesty, this humble monk still needs to make a living."</p><p>As he spoke, he pulled the young monk over. He said, "Half-grown brat, eating my life out, this humble monk also has no choice... this kid keeps saying he's hungry, this humble monk..."</p><p>The old monk chuckled and tried to convey that his deception was forced.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at them. She originally felt sorry for the old man and the young boy and let the old monk divine her fortune. Although she did not really intend to make it difficult for him or even wanted to do a good deed, she still needed to clarify things with them.</p><p>"Don't lie anymore in the future."</p><p>Jiang Juan took out some silver from her pouch. The old monk's eyes lit up as he reached out to grab it. However, Jiang Juan held on tightly and said, "I won't give you any. You're not honest at all."</p><p>The old monk rubbed his nose nervously and looked longingly at the silver in Jiang Juan's hand. Instead of giving it to him, she handed the silver to the young monk and said, "Keep this."</p><p>Little monk looked up at him, stunned for a moment before slowly clenching his fists.</p><p>"If I catch you cheating again, beautiful one," he said menacingly.</p><p>Jiang Juan frowned and glared at him sternly; the old monk was genuinely frightened. He hurriedly responded, "Poor monk knows, poor monk will not do it again."</p><p>"You better really mean that."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him before finally letting him off. Seeing this, the old monk rubbed his hands together and asked, "Sir Pilgrim, is there anything else you need?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, and the old monk grabbed little monk and started running. Although he was thin, he ran fast; little monk had short legs and could not keep up for long. As a result, the old monk dropped him and ran off by himself.</p><p>Little monk chased after him frantically, shouting, "Master, wait—wait for me, Master—!"</p><p>"Master Ananda—!"</p><p>Ananda?</p><p>That name sounded so familiar.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and leaned over the railing to look down. Before he could see anything clearly, someone pushed him forcefully from behind.</p><p>"BANG—!"</p><p>The world spun around him.</p>
