						<p>Jiang Juan wanted to stay overnight, and Xue Fangli also agreed. The maids quickly tidied up the bed and added an extra pillow.</p><p>"Everyone out."</p><p>Once it was nearly finished, Xue Fangli dismissed everyone as usual. They all left, but Lan Ting hesitated and said, "Young Master, you still need medicine. Servant…"</p><p>"I'll do it myself," Jiang Juan said. "You've taken care of me for a day. You don't have to worry about me today."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Lan Ting was used to staying in the side room and taking care of Jiang Juan. Before she could say more, Gao Guoshi interrupted her, "The Concubine has someone else to take care of her. Just do as she says."</p><p>Lan Ting had no choice but to give up.</p><p>However, she still couldn't help feeling uneasy. After all, Jiang Juan had some congenital health issues. Lan Ting carefully said, "Young Master, if you feel unwell, please don't push yourself."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. Only then did Lan Ting leave with Gao Guoshi and the others.</p><p>Lan Ting reminded Jiang Juan that he still needed medicine for his foot. Jiang Juan carefully removed the gauze. Fortunately, the wound wasn't deep; it had already healed and formed a scar.</p><p>How could I have stepped on a piece of glass? Jiang Juan sighed. "I'm so unlucky."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at his foot. The skin was delicate, yet there were several dark scars. He said, "Be more careful next time."</p><p>Jiang Juan solemnly vowed, "It won't happen again!"</p><p>Soon enough, someone brought Jiang Juan's medicine. With pale pink fingertips, he gently applied the ointment to his foot. Due to the pain, Jiang Juan applied it rather hastily, unwilling to touch it for too long.</p><p>He finished quickly. Just as he was about to put down his foot, Xue Fangli suddenly gripped his ankle. Jiang Juan was taken aback. "Your Highness?"</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly said, "Keep applying."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him guiltlessly, "I have done my best to apply it; I finished already."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, his hand still gripping Jiang Juan's ankle without letting go. With the other hand, he touched Jiang Juan's sole, spreading the uncured ointment.</p><p>He was very gentle, but too light, and Jiang Juan felt an itch. Her pearl-like toes curled up, a faint pink tinge appearing on them.</p><p>Jiang Juan took in a shallow breath, "Stop..."</p><p>Xue Fangli paused his movements.</p><p>He lifted his eyelids; Jiang Juan was biting his lower lip—too itchy for him to bear still, his fingers unconsciously clenching the soft cushion beneath the bed. His knuckles turned slightly pale, forming a sharp contrast with the dark-colored cushion.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fangli with watery eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli's hand suddenly tightened its grip on Jiang Juan's ankle; Jiang Juan inhaled again, "It hurts."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at him for a moment before finally releasing Jiang Juan's ankle. Jiang Juan took the opportunity to retract his foot.</p><p>He was so itchy that he turned around and said as if facing an enemy, "I'll do it myself this time; I will apply it properly."</p><p>When Jiang Juan came, his hair had only been loosely tied with a single satin ribbon, now fully spread out. His neck and shoulders were covered in dark hair, emitting a faint osmanthus scent that blended with the herbal smell.</p><p>Xue Fangli disliked the mixed scents of various aromas, but when they lingered on Jiang Juan, he did not find them unpleasant.</p><p>"Your hair was dried by a hand warmer?"</p><p>"Yes, it took too long to air dry, and Lanting was worried I would catch a chill."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head, truly applying the ointment seriously. After some time, he turned around again, holding out both hands to Xue Fangli, "It's all ointment."</p><p>Xue Fangli clapped several times, and soon, a maid brought in a basin of clean water. After cleaning up, Jiang Juan thought for a moment before asking Xue Fangli, "Should I call someone to help?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Hm?"</p><p>"Here," Jiang Juan pointed to the soft bed with one finger and stretched his other hand towards the bed, "to here. It's too far for me to reach, and with your poor health, you shouldn't be able to lift me either."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>He bent down, directly picked up Jiang Juan in his arms, and walked over.</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked, hesitated to speak, "You... "</p><p>Xue Fangli replied with a smile that was not quite a smile, "Even if this King is in poor health, I can still carry you such a distance."</p><p>He emphasized certain words heavily. Jiang Juan couldn't help but reflect on himself; he should have expressed it more tactfully; it hurt his pride too much. Even if the Prince was really unable to do it, he should have insisted that he could.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded vigorously and sincerely said, "Yeah, Your Highness can manage."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "... "</p><p>With Jiang Juan's mobility issues, once on the bed, he instinctively positioned himself on the inner side.</p><p>He had never shared a bed with anyone before. After lying down, he felt awkward and didn't dare to move much. Xue Fangli reached out to pull back the canopy and said indifferently, "Sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't speak; he lay on his side facing away from Xue Fangli. Clearly, he was extremely tired before getting into bed, but now that he was in bed, he couldn't fall asleep. He rubbed his head against the pillow, his hair being pressed beneath him.</p><p>A hand probed his nape, and Xue Fangli pulled out Jiang Juan's long hair. He casually asked, "Do you have a pet name?"</p><p>"Yes," Jiang Juan replied, "Jiang Lan."</p><p>Having said that, he suddenly turned around and grumbled, "Don't laugh. My mom—my mother would have given me the name Jiang Qin if she had, maybe I would be more active now."</p><p>Xue Fangli originally didn't intend to laugh but found himself wanting to smile seeing Jiang Juan's reaction; he curled his lips upwards.</p><p>There was no mockery, nor the usual cold smile; he simply wanted to laugh. Xue Fangli was actually quite beautiful, so beautiful it almost seemed sharp. At this moment, his expression softened, truly like a clear and bright day, with orchids and jade trees. Jiang Juan looked at him and found him quite pleasing to the eye, so she said generously, "Forget it, go ahead and laugh if you want to."</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan asked him, "Do you have a personal name?"</p><p>Xue Fangli still smiled, but something seemed to be weighing on his mind, making his eyebrows and eyes cold and thin. After some time, he answered rather regretfully, "No."</p><p>With a pause, Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said carelessly, "I'll tell you a story. Do you want to listen?"</p><p>Since he couldn't sleep anyway, Jiang Juan nodded, expressing great curiosity about ancient bedtime stories, "Okay."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "There was once a daughter whose first half of life was smooth and stable, loved and spoiled by her parents, respected and protected by her husband's family."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>"Then..."</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly. He suddenly remembered a very peaceful night. That night, the woman did not go mad; she merely knelt at the table, sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>Her shoulders shook violently, tears soaking all the papers, and the woman said with a choking voice, "Love desire to people is like holding a torch. Going against the wind, there must be the danger of burning one's hands."</p><p>"...there must be the danger of burning one's hands."</p><p>Xue Fangli's hand on Jiang Juan's neck suddenly moved as if it had been scalded.</p><p>Jiang Juan waited for a long time without any continuation of the story. He asked again, "Your Excellency, and then?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyelids. He said nothing, only staring at Jiang Juan, his gaze calm and still, so peaceful it made one's flesh crawl.</p><p>He left the young man, simply because he wanted to leave him; it had nothing to do with desire.</p><p>He did not have desire; he only had boundless hatred.</p><p>No one knew how long passed before Xue Fangli finally spoke. His tone was calm as he said, "There is no more. You should go to sleep."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Forget it, if they don't want to talk, then they won't talk. If it turns out to be a story about love-sick and heart-broken teenagers, he might get so angry that he can't fall asleep.</p><p>Jiang Juan tried to comfort himself, turned his head, and started to think of ways to fall asleep. Soon enough, he was lost in a sweet black dreamland.</p><p>Jiang Juan slept through the night until the next morning.</p><p>Not sleeping enough gave him a headache, but sleeping too long also made him uncomfortable. Just as Jiang Juan sat up with his hand on his forehead, Lanting pulled back the curtain.</p><p>"Sir, you are awake."</p><p>"Hm."</p><p>Jiang Juan realized belatedly that he was alone in bed and asked Lanting, "Where is the Prince?"</p><p>"The Prince had already left by the time I arrived."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded with an "oh." Lanting was about to ask if he wanted something to eat when a high official heard the noise and knocked on the door. "Princess Consort, the Sixth Prince has arrived. He waited for you for a while."</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned. "The Sixth Prince?"</p><p>The high official chuckled. "He said he wants to show you something special."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He did not want to see the treasure and did not wish to become unhappy. However, since everyone had already arrived, Jiang Juan could only reluctantly say, "Alright."</p><p>Gao Zhengshi hurriedly went to fetch someone. By the time Xue Congjun walked in with his head held high and chest puffed out, Lanting had almost finished preparing for Jiang Juan.</p><p>The moment Xue Congjun saw him, he said proudly, "Country bumpkin, today I will broaden your horizons."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he pushed the small box he was holding to Jiang Juan. "Take a look inside."</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously opened it and, upon looking down, nearly fainted.</p><p>——There was a bug at the bottom of the box!</p><p>Jiang Juan was extremely afraid of bugs. When he was young, he had experienced something similar as a prank; he intended to take a book from under the table, but instead touched a bug.</p><p>Years later, Jiang Juan was once again controlled by this fear. He was so scared that he almost threw the box away, fortunately Xue Congjun caught it in time.</p><p>Xue Congjun angrily asked, "What are you doing?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was also somewhat angry. "And what about you?"</p><p>"I——" Xue Congjun roared at him with great momentum, but after just uttering one word, he panicked himself and stammered, "Why are you crying? Why are you crying? Why are you crying?"</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan did not intend to cry; it was just that in the past, when he had been frightened badly, his tears seemed to have a mind of their own. Jiang Juan refused to admit it, "I’m not crying."</p><p>Xue Congjun, a notorious troublemaker, never tolerated weakness but always confronted strength head-on. He opened his mouth to say something but abruptly closed it again; his eyes kept involuntarily glancing at Jiang Juan.</p><p>——Why isn’t he crying? His eyelashes hung softly downward, and his gaze was moist with tears, as if the whole face were immersed in a mist.</p><p>Strange, this country bumpkin looks pretty even when he cries?</p><p>No way, that’s too dangerous of a thought.</p><p>He Niange is the true beauty, with both a beautiful appearance and a kind heart. This bumpkin is only a false beauty, superficial at best!</p><p>But——</p><p>This bumpkin really is strangely handsome.</p><p>Xue Congyun struggled for a long time but still failed. He pouted moodily and fiddled with the buckles, "Last time you refused to acknowledge that conch and sparrow were good things, so I specially found these two items for you. If you don’t like them, why are you crying?"</p><p>After saying that, Xue Congyun looked at him again. Although he didn’t know what was wrong with himself, he still hesitated before apologizing awkwardly, "I really don’t know what there is to cry about. Can I say sorry or not?"</p><p>Jiang Juan hadn’t recovered yet, but considering the apology from the other party, Jiang Juan still consoled him, "But you can’t act like this either."</p><p>Xue Congyun asked him, "What did I do?"</p><p>"You brought me these things and you’re asking me?" Jiang Juan said irritably, "Such a big insect."</p><p>Xue Congyun was even more confused than he was, "What insect? There’s only one jade peacock and one golden, golden…"</p><p>His words abruptly stopped. Xue Congyun suddenly realized something and burst into laughter.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>Xue Congyun pushed the box towards Jiang Juan again, indicating for Jiang Juan to open it. Jiang Juan shook his head fiercely, so Xue Congyun had to open it himself.</p><p>"Take a good look."</p><p>Xue Congyun took out a delicate object from the box—a thin jade leaf as delicate as a cicada’s wing, with a gold cicada perched on it, lifelike.</p><p>Xue Congyun: "Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "Hahahaha, what a huge insect!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "............"</p><p>Humans' joys and sorrows are not the same. Xue Congjun laughed like a pig, while Jiang Juan lost her dreams.</p><p>"It's impossible."</p><p>Xue Congjun made a final decision, "There must be some misunderstanding between you two."</p>
