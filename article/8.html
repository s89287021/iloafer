						<p>Jiang Juan wandered around without much interest.</p><p>He took a few steps but didn't feel like moving anymore. Whether it was the Imperial Flower Garden or the mountainous rockery, Jiang Juan was satisfied with just a distant glance and had no desire to wander through them personally.</p><p>Wang Zongguan noticed his lackluster expression and quickly approached him to inquire, "Princess, are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Of course, Jiang Juan couldn't tell the truth—he was tired and bored—so he nodded slightly, "I feel a bit unwell."</p><p>Wang Zongguan immediately escorted him to a pavilion to rest.</p><p>The pavilion was surrounded by three sides of the lake, with green lotus leaves floating on the surface. Jiang Juan leaned against the railing to enjoy the breeze; since it wasn't hot yet, the natural wind felt very comfortable.</p><p>He just didn't know what to do when summer arrived. There would be no cola or air conditioning.</p><p>Thinking about this made Jiang Juan feel a bit dejected again.</p><p>He lowered his hands, rested his head on his arm, and let the wide sleeves of his robe flap in the breeze, revealing a small section of his wrist, which should have been snow-white but had several red finger marks instead.</p><p>"Hey, you——"</p><p>Xue Congjun had waited all morning and finally caught Jiang Juan alone. He strutted into the pavilion with great flair, intending to put on a show, but he jumped back in surprise as soon as he lowered his head.</p><p>Jiang Juan's skin was fair, and these red marks were quite eye-catching, almost as if he had been tortured. Xue Congjun changed his tone, "What happened to your hand?"</p><p>After that, he remembered something and said cautiously, "I'm just asking, it wasn't me who did this, so don't go telling my older brother anything—Wang Zongguan, you need to vouch for me too."</p><p>It wasn't unreasonable for him to overreact; given Jiang Juan's malicious thoughts and the brutal beating he had received the previous night, Xue Congjun was forced to be cautious.</p><p>"Your servant has seen Prince Ling," Wang Zongguan bowed respectfully and said with a smile, "Prince Ling is being overly anxious."</p><p>Jiang Juan was still feeling hurt—he had lost his air conditioning and cola in summer and didn't want to deal with Xue Congjun at the moment. Xue Congjun waited for a while, seeing Jiang Juan's dejected mood made him feel somewhat uneasy, so he asked, "Hey, what's wrong? You don't look happy?"</p><p>He was just afraid that he would be misunderstood as the one who caused it; it was just a question, with absolutely no other intention.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him slowly and deliberately.</p><p>Therefore, although he was not particularly eager to deal with the main characters, Jiang Juan still put in some effort. He evaded the question by saying, "I feel a bit unwell."</p><p>Xue Congjun said "Oh," as he had heard his cousin mention that Jiang Juan suffered from heart disease. Xue Congjun continued asking, "What about your hand? Could it be that you were bullied?"</p><p>He did not say anything, and even Jiang Juan himself had forgotten. Jiang Juan lowered his head; his hand and wrist were red, looking quite painful, but he had long lost any sensation. Jiang Juan shook his head, "No."</p><p>Xue Congjun did not believe him. If he had not been bullied, why would he be lying here in a dejected mood.</p><p>Although Xue Congjun was generally careless, he had strong sense of justice. Therefore, he sternly said, "My cousin said that you invited him to the lake that day with prior intention."</p><p>"I don't think you're stupid," Xue Congjun said as he looked at Jiang Juan in puzzlement, "You didn't explain what happened after all those questions—Although I also dislike you, I do distinguish between public and private matters. If you really were bullied, I could still go out of my way to support you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Did the main character know that you are such a two-bit fool?</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan truthfully said, "It was accidentally squeezed by His Highness Wang."</p><p>Xue Congjun was silent for a few seconds before modifying his statement smoothly, "…Just consider it nothing happened."</p><p>He had just been the paragon of virtue, but upon hearing it was Xue Fangli, he turned into a spineless chicken. Jiang Juan could not resist laughing.</p><p>Xue Congjun also valued his pride. He became slightly irritated and angry as he looked up to glare at him, but once he met Jiang Juan's smiling eyes, he instantly deflated.</p><p>Damn, she looked really beautiful. </p><p>She was already as pretty as a fairy, and when she smiled, she looked even more beautiful.</p><p>No, no way.</p><p>He couldn't be deceived by her beauty.</p><p>The true beauty was his friend Ren. She was not only beautiful but also kind-hearted, and she had inner and outer beauty. Jiang Juan was just superficially attractive; he considered her a false beauty.</p><p>Xue Congjun struggled hard.</p><p>After a long time, Xue Congjun finally straightened his face and reluctantly got to the point, "Hey, what do you think about the little seagull pendant I sent you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Little seagull pendant? What kind of bird?</p><p>He looked bewildered. Xue Congjun reminded him, "It's a plaque carved with a small bird that looks and feels like a pearl."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Congjun tried to suppress his frustration, "My fifth brother gave it to you last night. Didn't he tell everyone to send the gifts there? I also sent the little seagull pendant along with them."</p><p>Jiang Juan fell into silence.</p><p>How should he respond? The several boxes of gifts were too rich; he didn't even finish reading the gift list, let alone notice the little seagull pendant. Jiang Juan hadn't paid any attention to it at all.</p><p>However, out of social etiquette, Jiang Juan still cooperated and said, "I remember now."</p><p>Xue Congjun stared at him expectantly, his eyes urging him on, but Jiang Juan didn't continue. Xue Congjun, unwilling to give up, hinted at him, "Don't you have anything to say about it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was utterly confused, "What?"</p><p>Of course, he would praise it to the skies!</p><p>Xue Congjun's vanity had not been satisfied. He took a deep breath and started putting on airs again, "A rustic like you has never seen such good things before, right?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had never even seen a conch pheasant, so there was nothing for him to compare it with. After hesitating for a few seconds, he said very calmly, "...You're right."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "?"</p><p>Hesitate, damn it! You actually dared to hesitate!</p><p>Forget about celestial maidens; now even the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother would make his heart race.</p><p>"Do you know how difficult it is to raise a conch pheasant?" Xue Congjun was visibly agitated. "Fishermen put the sign inside the shell, and they have to wait for many years before it can be as beautiful as a pearl. There are only a few in the whole world!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Oh, I see. That makes sense. I understand."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>He felt like he was being fooled again.</p><p>The more Xue Congjun thought about it, the angrier he got—after all his efforts to obtain this treasure, he had to hand it over, and the other person didn't even recognize its value, not to mention not praising it at all. Instead, they were being dismissive of him.</p><p>"My conch pheasant is not a good thing. Then what would you consider a good thing?" Xue Congjun was furious. "Forget it. Even if you have seen something more precious than a conch pheasant, I have something even better."</p><p>"Wait and see!"</p><p>After holding it in for so long, Xue Congjun squeezed out three words from between his teeth. He had so many treasures in his warehouse; he didn't believe he couldn't pick out the finest one to send to Jiang Juan and let this rustic broaden his horizons.</p><p>That damned competitive spirit of his!</p><p>Xue Congjun stormed off, completely forgetting the reason he had squatted by River Juan in the first place—to give his baoque one last pat, or perhaps to slip a few more treasures into it.</p><p>River Juan sighed. He didn’t want to get angry with Xue Congjun even if the latter provoked him; he would still end up furious anyway. Was Prince Ling of the Sixth House a pufferfish that had come to life, always brimming with anger?</p><p>Ignoring Xue Congjun, River Juan continued to quietly blow in the wind, feeling it was time to return. However, his day seemed particularly unlucky as he had already encountered Xue Congjun and now bumped into Duke Ping of An.</p><p>River Juan: “……”</p><p>Sighing, he wished for better luck. He had intended to pretend not to see him and simply walk past, but Duke Ping of An called out to him, "Madame."</p><p>River Juan could only stop and greet him, "Duke."</p><p>Duke Ping of An looked at him with a complicated expression.</p><p>During his alone time with Emperor Hongxing, he had actually become distracted by River Juan and did not insist on Emperor Hongxing granting him in marriage as before.</p><p>He thought it was guilt.</p><p>In the past, upon seeing him, River Juan would nervously bow his head and cautiously approach to flatter him. This was a stark contrast to his current polite yet distant attitude.</p><p>If he had not known that River Juan still retained the jade pendant and witnessed their interactions with Prince Li, Duke Ping of An would have assumed that River Juan had finally given up or completely let go.</p><p>Yes, it was Prince Li after all.</p><p>Even the Empress could not win him over, how much less so River Juan. He feared him and dared not anger him in the slightest, much less reveal his feelings—it was only natural.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Duke Ping of An asked River Juan softly, "Do you resent me?"</p><p>This marriage arrangement should have fallen to Jiang Niantou. It was due to the joint efforts of Duke Ping of An and Secretary General Jiang that even Prince Eldest contributed significantly, that Emperor Hongxing agreed and changed it to be with River Juan.</p><p>He knew that Jiang Juan had feelings for him, but he could do nothing about it.</p><p>"No."</p><p>How could Jiang Juan hate the Duke of Ping An? If not for them, Jiang Juan would never have married King Li or become a eunuch. He sincerely said, "I wanted to thank you."</p><p>The answer was unexpected. The Duke of Ping An frowned after listening and then firmly replied, "You resent me in your heart."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He didn't, really.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at the Duke of Ping An curiously, not wanting to deal with him anymore and tried to leave. However, the Duke of Ping An grabbed his wrist suddenly.</p><p>The Duke of Ping An pursed his lips.</p><p>Jiang Juan's expression earlier inexplicably irritated him.</p><p>That kind of transparency was also filled with indifference.</p><p>It was completely different from his former gloominess. Moreover, the Duke of Ping An could not see any sentiment in his eyes; only avoidance of himself.</p><p>Jiang Juan instinctively struggled. The Duke of Ping An realized something was amiss and let go of his wrist, switching to grabbing his sleeve instead. Jiang Juan's wrist was exposed, covered with eye-catching red fingerprints.</p><p>The Duke of Ping An was stunned, "Is it His Highness the Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him, saying, "Let go of me."</p><p>If it had been mere speculation before, now the Duke of Ping An was completely certain.</p><p>Jiang Juan did not have a good time in the Palace of King Li.</p><p>I knew it. Duke Li was a man like this, with a cruel nature and a penchant for torturing others.</p><p>His unprovoked anger faded away, and Marquis of Anping felt guilty, saying, "Entering the Prince's Mansion is my fault."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... No, you didn't."</p><p>—You're just talking trash; I don't believe it.</p><p>But Jiang Juan really wasn't angry. He had changed his mindset, having died once, he valued life and knew that being angry wasn't worth it. What if anger made him sick?</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan said seriously, "Your Excellency, Duke Li did not wrong me at all. In fact, Prince Wang is virtuous and refined, quite different from the rumors. He treated me well; entering the Prince's Mansion was my good fortune."</p><p>Who Duke Li was, Marquis of Anping couldn't be unaware. He had interacted with Duke Li before, knowing how dangerous and tyrannical the man was.</p><p>Marquis of Anping said, "You don't need to do this. Duke Li is eccentric, cruel, and vicious; I know him better than you."</p><p>But hearing is believing, right? And Jiang Juan wasn't unfamiliar with Xue Fangli. He didn't want to argue with Marquis of Anping anymore and tried to pull away again, "Your Excellency, please be cautious with your words."</p><p>Marquis of Anping looked at him for a long time, thinking he was scared, "Jiang Juan, you——"</p><p>"No matter how this Prince behaves, I am still inferior to Your Excellency in discussing behind my back."</p><p>A man's soft voice came from afar. He seemed indifferent, unsure how long he had been there or what he had heard.</p><p>Marquis of Anping's expression changed.</p><p>After a pause, Xue Fangli said slowly, "Your Excellency has said so much, yet you forgot that Third Young Master is this Prince's lawfully wedded wife."</p><p>Marquis of Anping froze.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and seemingly kindly reminded, "Duke of Anping, your hand."</p><p>Duke of Anping neither took it nor left it, and Jiang Juan felt unlucky when he seized the opportunity to snatch it back.</p><p>Running into Duke of Anping and being caught on the spot by Xue Fangli, would he be misunderstood by His Excellency?</p><p>Thinking this way, Jiang Juan glanced at him several times with moist eyes.</p><p>Acting so helpless?</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, naturally noticing Jiang Juan's little moves. He frowned and finally spoke again.</p><p>"His Highness is frivolous, cruel, and fierce. Duke of Anping should be more careful in the future," Xue Fangli said slowly with a smile, "If this happens again, His Highness might take your entire hand."</p><p>He spoke calmly as if making an innocent joke, but Duke of Anping knew that Xue Fangli was serious.</p><p>He was warning him.</p><p>Duke of Anping bowed his head and replied, "Yes."</p><p>Xue Fangli had a hint of a smile on his lips. After a long while, he said leisurely, "Does Duke of Anping not know how to address Young Master San?"</p><p>Unable to understand Xue Fangli's intentions, Duke of Anping could only reply with dignity, "…Princess Consort."</p><p>"Turns out Duke of Anping knows," Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow and said with a half-smile, "Then why did this Highness hear Duke of Anping call Young Master San by his given name just now?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's smile did not fade, yet his eyes were cold.</p><p>Duke of Anping knew that His Highness was deliberately insulting him, but he could do nothing about it. When His Highness went berserk, even the current emperor was helpless and had to listen helplessly, let alone himself.</p><p>Silence fell for a moment. The Duke of Ping An said, "It was this vassal who offended. Please forgive us, Your Highness and Lady Wang."</p><p>Xue Fangli lifted his eyes, looking at him with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, clearly still not satisfied.</p><p>Seeing this, the Duke of Ping An gritted his teeth, raised both hands above his head, bent deeply, and performed a proper bow, "Please forgive—Your Highness and Lady Wang."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan, signaling him to speak up.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...It's fine, it's fine."</p><p>His Excellency was magnanimous, of course choosing to forgive.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Juan didn't dare not forgive either; he was feeling quite complicated inside.</p><p>The Duke of Ping An was the main character's attacker after all.</p><p>But lying flat like a flounder and having someone support him was so happy, truly very happy.</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded and didn't even spare the Duke of Ping An another glance, only saying to Jiang Juan, "Let's go back."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "Don't we need to see the Emperor again?"</p><p>Xue Fangli hummed and took a step forward first, with Jiang Juan quickly following him.</p><p>The Duke of Ping An stood up, looking silently at the two departing figures, a hint of killing intent flashing in his suppressed gaze.</p><p>Departing from the King.</p><p>Let's see how long you can still be arrogant.</p><p>As for Jiang Juan, he didn't blame him for airing his grievances against himself; after all, he had indeed wronged him.</p><p>He would do his best to make up for his deep emotions.</p><p>If Jiang Juan knew Lord Pinghuan's thoughts, he might flee the capital city overnight, but Jiang Juan was unaware of it.</p><p>The imperial city did not allow carriages to enter. He and Xue Fangli were still on their way when Jiang Juan absentmindedly recalled the plot.</p><p>Regarding the death of King Li, the book had this passage:</p><p>—"That night, King Li rested at his villa. In the middle of the night, he suddenly fell ill, coughing up blood uncontrollably. The accompanying imperial physician rushed to his side but could do nothing to help. Before dawn, news of King Li's death reached the capital city. Upon hearing the news, the emperor was furious and dismissed court for three days, executing over a hundred people."</p><p>Why were so many people executed?</p><p>Was it sheer pique, or...</p><p>Jiang Juan thought deeply about this when Xue Fangli suddenly asked him, "What are you thinking about?"</p><p>His train of thought interrupted, Jiang Juan instinctively replied, "Thinking about you..."</p><p>The news of his death.</p><p>Fortunately, he came back to his senses in time and did not finish the sentence. Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow with interest and asked, "Oh? What do you think about this king?"</p><p>"But Your Majesty said," Xue Fangli said, "I am frivolous, cruel, and vicious."</p><p>What is there to think about that, Jiang Juan looked at him strangely, "Your Majesty isn't like that. Why would you think so?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked carelessly, "Don't you believe him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan immediately shook his head, "I only believe in Your Majesty."</p><p>After a moment's thought, he raised his head, blinked his eyelashes a few times, and curved his soft lips upward, smiling with furrowed brows, "Just like how Your Majesty believed in me before."</p><p>He would do his utmost to make amends for his deep emotions.</p><p>If Jiang Juan had known Lord Pinghuan's thoughts, he might have fled the capital city overnight, but Jiang Juan was unaware of them.</p><p>The imperial city did not permit carriages to enter.
