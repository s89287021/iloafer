						<p>Xue Fangli: "……hand."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't let go of him, "You better explain clearly first."</p><p>Being pinched by someone was an experience Xue Fangli had never had before. After all, no one dared to be so bold in front of him unless they wanted to die.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan without any expression, but Jiang Juan wasn't afraid at all. Instead, she asked sympathetically, "Your Highness, do you need some time to think up an excuse?"</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't stupid. The jade pendant was a gift from his master; of course, only the King could have given it to her. If he hadn't mentioned it himself, it was purely because he disliked Duke Pingan and wanted to show some respect to the King. Now that Duke Pingan was gone, Jiang Juan couldn't bear it anymore.</p><p>Xue Fangli asked her, "Are you unhappy?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "Guess."</p><p>Xue Fangli covered Jiang Juan's hand expressionlessly, "It's just a jade pendant. There are many more in the warehouse. If you want one, go and take another to play with."</p><p>The key wasn't whether he had a jade pendant to play with; Jiang Juan emphasized, "Your Highness, you're lying."</p><p>He was indignant, silent for a few seconds, then Xue Fangli said slowly, "This matter, this king is also unaware of it."</p><p>"That day, this king gave the jade pendant to Gao De and asked him to put it in the warehouse. You were there; have you forgotten?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Mm, I was there. But—"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Later, this king rewarded him and let him pick something from the warehouse himself. He chose this jade pendant."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him without speaking, as if she was somewhat convinced. Xue Fangli released Jiang Juan's hand apologetically, "This king is wrong. He said he took a jade pendant, but this king didn't ask further and had no idea that he would give it to someone else immediately."</p><p>In fact, every word he just said was an attempt to fool Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Fangli knew very well what kind of person Gao Degongshi was, and precisely because of his promiscuity, Xue Fangli gave the jade pendant to him. After all, this jade pendant was truly eye-catching. He had thought it would be seen by Duke Pingan in a few days, but he hadn't expected to run into him today.</p><p>Isn't this too coincidental? Jiang Juan asked doubtfully, "Really?"</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded, "Mm."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Alright."</p><p>"Palace?"</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and took a few steps forward to look at the Dance Pavilion. Due to Fang Shangshang's sudden misfortune, all the women had knelt down in despair. The lead dancer, who was being blamed, also lowered her head and looked at the shattered jade pendant with tearful eyes, trying to piece it together.</p><p>The pendant wasn't stolen, but it got smashed into pieces. Today, the only victim was herself, an unjust calamity. Jiang Juan slowly frowned.</p><p>He stood still, and Xue Fangli stopped as well, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed, "So unlucky."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, his brows slightly furrowed in sympathy.</p><p>Xue Fangli had seen this expression on Jiang Juan's face countless times before. In the past, the person being looked at and pitied by Jiang Juan was him.</p><p>Unconsciously frowning, Xue Fangli did not want to share anything about Jiang Juan with others. He asked casually, "Did Little Bodhisattva have a compassionate heart?"</p><p>Jiang Juan protested, "Don't call me that; it's so strange."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled and changed the question, "Want to help her?"</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan honestly nodded and hesitated, "But..."</p><p>He hadn't figured out how to help yet. The pendant could be repaired, but even if it were restored perfectly, its value would be diminished after being shattered once. Giving her another one wasn't impossible, but—</p><p>"The jade pendant was not broken by me. I can send you another one if you like, although I think I have already replaced one for Lord Hou, and I am not too keen on it."</p><p>"So, let's do it," Xue Fali said happily, "Whoever breaks the jade pendant should replace it."</p><p>After saying that, he moved closer to the woman, whispered a few words to her, handed her a token, and then approached Jiang Juan. He glanced at him blandly and said, "Go ahead."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at the woman, who indeed stopped crying and smiled. Curiously, he asked, "Your Highness, what did you say to her?"</p><p>Xue Fali glanced at him, raised his hand to turn Jiang Juan's face, and casually replied, "You'll know in a few days."</p><p>He was actually setting a mystery! Jiang Juan pushed Xue Fali's hand a few times but couldn't push it away. He even imitated Jiang Juan earlier and held his face.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "...Your Highness, let go of my face."</p><p>Not only did Xue Fali not release him; he squeezed a few more times. He evaluated slowly, "The feeling is nice."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Thank you?"</p><p>Xue Fali: "So formal. How about letting this king squeeze it a bit more?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sincerely said, "Your Highness, you can squeeze your own face. The feeling isn't bad either, really."</p><p>Xue Fali yawned lazily and raised his crimson lips, his voice deep and melodious, "But I prefer the feel of my lady."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Being stunned by the title "Madam," Jiang Juan was quiet for a while before he managed to calm down. He said softly, "Prince, your sense of revenge is truly formidable."</p><p>When he pinched him, the Prince would pinch back; unintentionally calling him husband, the Prince would retaliate with "Madam." Jiang Juan slowly said, "Can't you be more magnanimous?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes and asked, "Is this not already magnanimous enough from this prince's side toward you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head. "Where is it magnanimous?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't say anything more but simply chuckled softly. "Greedy."</p><p>Being pampered to such an extent that he didn't even realize his own arrogance, still complaining about him not being magnanimous.</p><p>He really was spoiled rotten.</p><p>"Prince, Princess."</p><p>He respectfully called out. Not long after, the curtains were lifted, and Jiang Juan was carried down from the carriage by Xue Fangli. Jiang Juan clung to Xue Fangli's shoulder, looked at Gao Guanshi, remembered something, and said to him, "Manager, you..."</p><p>"Go ahead and light up the path."</p><p>Xue Fangli calmly ordered, and Gao Guanshi smiled at Jiang Juan before taking a few steps forward with his lantern. Without giving it much thought, Jiang Juan continued, "Manager, it's just that..."</p><p>"If there's anything to say, go ahead and say it later."</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression didn't change as he once again interrupted Jiang Juan's words. Curiously, Jiang Juan asked, "Why should I say it later?"</p><p>Xue Fangli appeared casually indifferent and asked, "What do you want to tell him?"</p><p>Jiang Juan whispered his answer, "Isn't Hua Yang the manager's lover? She suffered an unjust calamity today; shouldn't the manager go comfort her?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>It turned out he had overthought it.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xue Fangli smiled gently and said in a mild tone, "Talking to him now would only distract him. Later on, when his lover... should also be sent away, I will speak with him."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an “oh” and fell silent. Instead, Xue Fangli examined Jiang Juan for a moment before slowly saying, "You have a good heart."</p><p>Jiang Juan grumbled, "Your Highness, every time you say this to me, it feels like you are mocking me."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "Why do you think so?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Just like that feeling."</p><p>Xue Fangli laughed and said in a leisurely tone, "Of course, I am not mocking you. The more kind-hearted you are, the happier I am. After all..."</p><p>there can be even more compassion shown to him.</p><p>When they arrived at Liangfeng Courtyard, Jiang Juan was placed on the bed. Xue Fangli, without looking back, ordered the chief steward, "I have brought a chef with me; go and arrange for him."</p><p>"Yes, Your Highness."</p><p>Jiang Juan paid little heed to it, while after dismissing the chief steward, Xue Fangli also went to take a bath. Jiang Juan fiddled with his Nine-Linked Rings, but before he could play with them properly, someone returned.</p><p>"Princess Consort."</p><p>The chief steward, feeling guilty like a thief, lowered his voice and said, "What do you wish to say to me?"</p><p>Having served Xue Fangli for several years, the chief steward naturally understood that every time Xue Fangli interrupted, it was because he did not want Jiang Juan to speak with him.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the chief steward would of course honestly avoid being seen by Jiang Juan so as not to be caught. However, things were different now; over this period, the chief steward had come to understand.</p><p>-- The Prince responded to the Princess's requests without fail, even flattering her when necessary, let alone his servants.</p><p>Whenever the Princess spoke to him, he would naturally listen carefully.</p><p>Even behind the Prince's back, he listened attentively.</p><p>The Prince said he would speak with the steward later, so as not to distract him. Jiang Juan asked, "Are you done with your work?"</p><p>The high steward smiled and said, "Yes, I'm finished."</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment and then roughly described today's events in Chengde Hall. He told the high steward, "The jade pendant was broken, it seemed to upset her very much."</p><p>The high steward was taken aback; he did not expect Jiang Juan to mention this. He hurriedly replied, "Thank you, Your Highness, for specifically informing me. I will go check on it right away."</p><p>Feeling that the high steward might worry too much, Jiang Juan added, "You don't need to be too worried. The Prince said he would help."</p><p>How could the Prince refuse? The high steward knew well that this must have something to do with the Princess. He was rather grateful and stood respectfully to one side, waiting for Jiang Juan's next words.</p><p>But after waiting and waiting, Jiang Juan did not continue his explanation but instead focused on playing the nine-link ring. After a few seconds of hesitation, the high steward asked him, "Princess, do you have no other matters to discuss?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up blankly, "Ah? What else is there?"</p><p>Whenever the Princess tried to speak with him, the Prince would interrupt her repeatedly, which made it seem as though he was hiding something from her. It didn't seem to be just a reminder that Hongyu had been wronged today.</p><p>The high steward scratched his head and gently reminded him, "Princess, aside from this, weren't you going to inquire about something from me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "No."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Juan suddenly thought of something. He spoke slowly, "The Prince reminded you that the jade pendant belonged to the Marquis. If you touched it, there might have been some trouble. But you insisted on taking this jade pendant anyway."</p><p>"Steward, there are so many treasures in the warehouse. The Prince told you to choose whatever you wanted, yet why did you select this jade pendant?"</p><p>Heigansi: "???"</p><p>Which warehouse would he choose? He insisted on taking this jade pendant. Didn't the Prince give it to him after taking it from the Princess?</p><p>The Prince was deceiving the Princess.</p><p>If the Princess asked around, Heigansi would definitely reveal everything; however, he couldn't say anything about such matters. Heigansi chuckled and evaded the question, saying, "This jade pendant has a good waterhead. The slave instantly fell in love with it. Even though the Prince said it was troublesome, I still took it."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He murmured softly, "The Prince is indeed deceiving me."</p><p>Heigansi's heart sank as he cursed inwardly.</p><p>—It seemed like he had been deceived by the Princess.</p><p>Not long after, Xue Fangli left the room.</p><p>Dressed in a complex dark robe with his hair still dripping water droplets and damp patches on his shoulders and sleeves, Xue Fangli entered the room but found Jiang Juan absent. Only Heigansi stood trembling beside him. Raising an eyebrow, he asked, "Where is the Princess?"</p><p>Heigansi answered evasively, "She... left."</p><p>Xue Fangli shot a questioning glance at him. Bracing himself, Heigansi said, "The Princess accused you of deceiving her and even claimed that it happened twice, saying that you should sleep alone tonight—"</p><p>"Go to bed yourself."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>Heigansi secretly observed him, swallowing hard before saying, "Your Highness, do you have any other orders? If not, the slave will leave."</p><p>Xue Fangli asked with a fake smile, "Where are you going?"</p><p>Anyway, it was all the same. Loving to compete would lead to victory. The executive eunuch gathered his courage and said, "The Duchess ordered me to go see my concubine. He also said that if Your Highness did not allow me to go or blamed me for it, he——"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "What would he do then?"</p><p>The executive eunuch spoke slowly, "You won't just be sleeping alone; in the future, he won't even send you off."</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>A glance swept over the executive eunuch. Xue Fangli did not know if he was laughing at being angered or what else, but his rosy lips curled slightly, and his breath was as cold as ice.</p><p>The pressure was overwhelming, and the executive eunuch barely dared to breathe. After an unknown amount of time, Xue Fangli slowly said one word, "Leave."</p><p>The executive eunuch bowed and quickly ran away, fearing that His Highness might change his mind and come back to punish him.</p><p>However——</p><p>It was said that relying on a big tree provided good shade. The Duchess sure knew how to enjoy the shade.</p><p>Retreating while watching from afar, the executive eunuch marveled inwardly and realized something.</p><p>They would probably have to rename it the LiWife Palace soon.</p>
