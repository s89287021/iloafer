						<p>Most of the time, Jiang Juan's dullness was very... this moment, however, he sensed something.</p><p>Xue Fangli's gaze was too complicated and too intense.</p><p>Hatred, disdain, mockery, but more than anything else, a cold chill in his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, "Your Highness..."</p><p>"Who told you?"</p><p>The steward, upon hearing this, immediately lowered his head guiltily. Xue Fangli glanced at him, but Jiang Juan did not reveal who it was, "I heard."</p><p>It wasn't exactly lying. He first learned from Xue Congjun and then asked the steward for more details, but Jiang Juan still felt a bit guilty.</p><p>He shouldn't have mentioned it; it made the Your Highness even angrier.</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan quietly.</p><p>No wonder he came to accompany him, no wonder he wanted to soothe him.</p><p>His little Bodhisattva knew nothing...</p><p>Ignorance was frustrating, yet she willingly offered her innocent heart boldly.</p><p>How many people had his heart been given to?</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly, letting the inexplicable emotions ferment and then suppressing them deeply. After a moment, he returned to normal, smiling as he said, "How am I related to her?"</p><p>That woman is dead; how could he not be indifferent.</p><p>Only regret that even in death, she lingered like a ghost. During his episodes, in his brief dreams, the woman wept bloody tears, cursing him relentlessly day after day.</p><p>"The King is not in a bad mood, and there's no need for you to accompany me," Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. "Since you are not interested in watching the peacock, go back to rest. I have matters to attend to and can't afford to be distracted."</p><p>He gave the guest an indication to leave. Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment, afraid that he might miss something important, and then nodded, "Alright."</p><p>Just before leaving the door, Jiang Juan turned around. The man stood by his desk, tall and imposing, with a few strands of black hair falling onto his shoulders. His lips were painted an unnaturally vivid red; although he was smiling, it seemed forced, adding to an air of loneliness.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan looking at him, Xue Fangli continued, "A few days later... on her memorial day, I will go to Miaolin Temple alone in the mansion, so feel free."</p><p>Jiang Juan instinctively asked, "Can I go with you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli simply replied, "In the mansion."</p><p>This meant he was unwilling to bring him along. Jiang Juan responded with a single "uhm," followed by, "Alright."</p><p>He had no objections, though he wondered why Xue Fangli mentioned this so early on. But Jiang Juan soon understood.</p><p>That day onwards, Jiang Juan did not see Xue Fangli for three consecutive days.</p><p>Without Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan enjoyed the king-sized bed alone, which was quite pleasant. The eel could finally turn over freely without worrying about disturbing anyone nearby. However, Jiang Juan couldn't help but feel concerned about Xue Fangli's condition.</p><p>During that period, Dr. Sun, the imperial physician, visited to check on his foot injury. Jiang Juan's recovery was going well; he had already been able to walk, though he could not stand for too long yet.</p><p>At the end of the month, Jiang Juan woke up early as planned. He pulled back the canopy and asked, "Lanting, is he...?"</p><p>As expected, Lanting stayed by Jiang Juan's side. She hurriedly responded, "Yes, Your Excellency. What's wrong?"</p><p>"Could you check if the Prince is..."</p><p>"The Prince left the mansion with the steward before dawn."</p><p>Lanting knew what he was inquiring about; she had seen it that morning. Upon hearing this, Jiang Juan let go of the canopy.</p><p>Today was the memorial day for the Lady Yu Mei, and Jiang Juan was not quite at ease. He had originally intended to spend some time with Prince Wang, but the person was already gone. He could only nod and say, "Alright."</p><p>With nothing to do, Jiang Juan lay back on the bed again, stretching out like a fish pancake. Lanting saw this and said, "Public affairs have been settled. You can go back to sleep after having your meal."</p><p>Well then, Jiang Juan dressed up and sat at the table, but an unexpected guest suddenly arrived in the palace.</p><p>"Princess Consort," a maid by Empress Dowager's side bowed her head and said, "Empress Dowager is devoted to Buddhism and does not concern herself with worldly affairs. A few days ago, she learned of your marriage to Prince Wang. Today, she has found time to invite you to the palace for a visit."</p><p>Empress Dowager?</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled and recalled the plot.</p><p>The joy of a coddled protagonist novel lies in the fact that everyone except the antagonist admires and willingly serves as tools for the protagonist's suffering.</p><p>In the story, Empress Dowager was one such tool. Jiang Juan remembered her fondness for the protagonist and thought she was quite a kind elderly lady.</p><p>However, no matter how kind she was, she still belonged to the protagonist's entourage. Jiang Juan did not want to be in the spotlight, and since she was also an elder, he was hesitating when someone called out to him.</p><p>"Princess Consort."</p><p>Xue Fangli accompanied by his steward, only guards remained in the courtyard. Someone whispered, "You..."</p><p>How should he respond?</p><p>There had long been deep-seated resentment between Empress Dowager and Lady Yu Mei as well as Prince Wang. How could common servants like them discuss such grievances?</p><p>The guard spoke but did not know how to stop Jiang Juan. Instead, he turned to the maid and said, "Princess Consort's foot injury is yet to heal. It would be inconvenient for her to enter the palace. Perhaps another day..."</p><p>The maid interrupted him softly, "Empress Dowager does not have time every day."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought for a moment and decided to make an appearance, albeit reluctantly. He said to the guard, "Alright, I suppose so. Doctor Sun said recovery is almost complete; there's no need to worry."</p><p>After saying that, he looked at the palace maiden. The maiden smiled and said, "Please follow me, Lady Jiang."</p><p>Jiang Juan then left with her.</p><p>The guards who were left to protect Jiang Juan watched from afar. Soon, the leader of the guards gritted his teeth and said, "Follow him, I will go find His Highness."</p><p>This was Jiang Juan's first time entering the palace without the King.</p><p>Last time, there had been the King; this time, it was just him. Jiang Juan silently repeated her cautionary words and finally arrived at Cining Palace.</p><p>The Empress Dowager knelt amidst a sea of incense smoke, continuously turning the prayer beads in her hand. The palace maiden softly said, "Your Highness, the person has been brought here."</p><p>With a snap, the Empress Dowager clenched the beads and stopped turning them. Without looking back, she asked, "Just Jiang Juan?"</p><p>"… Yes."</p><p>"What do you know about the ancestor being worshipped here?"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked up; there were many memorial tablets around the Buddha statue. She answered this question: "Xue's ancestors?"</p><p>"Not bad," the Empress Dowager slowly opened her eyes, and a palace maiden helped her up. "All my Xue family's ancestors are here."</p><p>"I pray to the Buddha day and night for my ancestors' blessings, hoping they will bring prosperity to our nation and ensure it endures without interruption."</p><p>The Empress Dowager turned around and said, "…"</p><p>Her voice paused as she said with a complicated expression, "Such a beautiful child."</p><p>The Empress Dowager hated beautiful people more than anything in life. However, Jiang Juan's good looks were not frivolous or vulgar; she had the beauty of a blossoming flower, yet her demeanor was as clear and pure as a mirror. Seeing her brought peace to one's mind.</p><p>Having worshipped Buddha for many years, the Empress Dowager particularly admired those with a Buddhist aura. Her satisfaction with Jiang Juan stemmed from his tranquil demeanor, which made her believe he had good karmic connections.</p><p>Today, I saw Jiang Juan and was even more amazed by her beauty. When the Empress Dowager looked at him, Jiang Juan was also staring at her intently. Amidst the incense smoke, she had a momentary illusion that she saw a Bodhisattva sitting on the lotus throne.</p><p>At this point, the Empress Dowager sighed and said slowly, "The newly wedded Lady of Li Wang should kneel before our ancestors for three days and pray for the prosperity of our great country."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at her in shock. Praying for three days meant kneeling for three days. Wasn't that too long?</p><p>The Empress Dowager smiled at him, looking truly kind and benevolent. "What? You're unwilling?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was indeed reluctant, but he could sense this was a life-threatening order.</p><p>If he refused to kneel before his ancestors, it would mean showing no respect for elders. If he refused to pray for the country's prosperity, they might execute him.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Why did he have to be the one to do wrong?</p><p>He felt incredibly conflicted. He wanted to behave cautiously.</p><p>Still, kneeling for three days was really long and tiring.</p><p>No, he had to try to resist.</p><p>"No," Jiang Juan said slowly, "I... my younger self has always been in poor health..."</p><p>Heart disease brick, Jiang Juan was just about to move the bricks when he suddenly had a brilliant idea and thought of a better excuse. He asked Dowager Empress, "Empress Dowager! Do you know about Child Life?"</p><p>Dowager Empress has been a Buddhist for many years and naturally knows about Child Life.</p><p>Immortal children are fond of the human world and sneak down to earth, but with their full divine connections, they have no connection to the secular world; therefore, most of them are weak, often ill, and prone to early death.</p><p>"My junior frequently suffers from heart disease, almost not surviving several times. Later..." Jiang Juan said, "My grandfather encountered a master who said that my junior has a Child Life fate, destined for an early demise. If one wants to live longer, they must not enter temples in this life, nor worship Buddha."</p><p>After finishing, Jiang Juan hesitated and said uncertainly, "That master... seemed to be called Ananda?"</p><p>"Master Ananda?"</p><p>When Dowager Empress heard that, she was startled out of her seat, "Have you seen him? Where and when?"</p><p>Jiang Juan mentioned Master Ananda purely to increase credibility. He did not expect such a strong reaction from Dowager Empress. He vaguely said, "I don't know either. I was too sick at the time and had already lost consciousness..."</p><p>Dowager Empress frowned but did not say anything, only continuing to twist her rosary beads.</p><p>If Child Life fate were placed on others, Dowager Empress would be furious, but with Jiang Juan, she had always believed he had Buddha in him. Moreover, he mentioned Master Ananda.</p><p>Many years ago, Dowager Empress was just an unloved concubine. The previous emperor exiled her to Zhao'an Temple, thinking that this would be the end of her life. Dowager Empress cried nonstop. Then a monk comforted her, "Do not cry, miss. Your fate is noble, and whenever you encounter difficulties, auspicious signs will appear. Your future will be glorious."</p><p>This monk called himself Ananda.</p><p>No one knew about this incident; Dowager Empress never mentioned it to others. However, on every Buddha's birthday, she would visit Zhao'an Temple once. Unfortunately, after that, she had never seen the master again.</p><p>"If so, you indeed cannot worship Buddha."</p><p>Dowager Empress gave a light snort. She originally planned to force Jiang Juan to kneel using ancestral and national fortune as an excuse, but today he managed to dodge this fate.</p><p>Jiang Juan secretly sighed in relief and said sincerely, "If the life fate does not allow it, my junior is willing to worship Buddha daily for the prosperity of the nation."</p><p>"Imperial rites are not in order," the Empress Dowager glanced at him a few times and said with a smile, "Then why don't you copy it for Aimei?"</p><p>As she finished speaking, the Empress Dowager seemed to recall something and slowly asked Jiang Juan, "If I remember correctly, today should be Yumei's memorial day, right?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded. "Yes."</p><p>The Empress Dowager smiled again. "Well, that's fortunate. Then you can copy The Brilliance for Aimei."</p><p>Deciding to do it, Jiang Juan agreed. However, as soon as a maidservant brought the book over, he began to regret his decision. It was a thick volume, comparable to the Oxford English-Chinese Dictionary.</p><p>So many characters.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed. No matter how much he regretted it, he eventually picked up his brush. After all, Yumei was Prince Wang's mother; copying the text might have some blessing effect.</p><p>Since Prince Wang didn't take him to Miaolin Temple, Jiang Juan thought of it as a rare opportunity to bless Prince Wang's mother.</p><p>With this in mind, Jiang Juan began to copy page by page. However, with so many characters, he couldn't help but sneak in a little laziness.</p><p>Seeing that he was writing seriously, the Empress Dowager signaled for the maidservant to help her over. She lowered her head and examined it closely before saying strangely, "These characters are written... well..."</p><p>They were neat, but just barely neat. Far from reaching the standard praised by Jiang Nian one day.</p><p>The Empress Dowager expressed dissatisfaction. "Write properly."</p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Juan subconsciously switched hands.</p><p>He was left-handed; when he didn't feel like writing properly, he would switch to his right hand and write in a messy manner.</p><p>After switching hands, Jiang Juan began copying again. But after writing a few lines, the Empress Dowager asked him, "Why is it in Regular Script?"</p><p>Is Regular Script not good?</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment, changed the font, and not long after, the Empress Dowager said, "Cursive script?"</p><p>Jiang Juan detected her surprise, assuming that the Empress Dowager was dissatisfied. He could only change to another font again. This time, the Empress Dowager did not speak but frowned.</p><p>What is wrong?</p><p>After a while, the Empress Dowager said slowly, "You are actually proficient in so many fonts."</p><p>"A few days ago, your brother said that you write exquisite slender gold script with clear brushstrokes and slim elegance," the Empress Dowager praised. "Today I see that it is not just your slender gold script; you have also mastered Tangkai, cursive script, and Yan style to a high degree."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>So this was why.</p><p>He had been startled, thinking that the Empress Dowager would be like his grandfather, displeased with him for not writing properly.</p><p>But—</p><p>Jiang Juan felt immensely relieved.</p><p>"It's a pity..."</p><p>The Empress Dowager spoke again, feeling that Jiang Juan suited her in every way. He was separated from his concubine and had a childlike disposition, yet no matter how much she liked him, she could not summon him into the palace like Jiang Nian.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, the Empress Dowager said lightly, "Since you are proficient in so many fonts, why don't you write each one for me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Is this considered law enforcement fishing?</p><p>Not like that at all.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very reluctant. Just transcribing one copy would take him a whole day without eating or drinking, let alone four copies. Moreover, standing for so long, his feet were starting to ache.</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated and said, "Empress Dowager, I have an injury on my foot and can't stand for too long."</p><p>The Empress Dowager glanced at him and said with a smile, "If you can't stand for too long, then kneel and finish transcribing."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>No way, there was no way he could finish so much. His hand also hurt.</p><p>He had to think of a solution.</p><p>Usually, Jiang Juan was lazy and didn't like moving or thinking, but once faced with excessive work that threatened his slothful life, he would do anything to overcome the difficulties so that he could get back to lying around comfortably.</p><p>Like at this moment.</p><p>Writing four times was sheer torture. Not allowed to sit down, Jiang Juan tried to think of a way out, but he couldn't bear it and decided to play a trick.</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head, regained his pen, and began copying the text line by line again, as if he had accepted reality and would honestly write here until the end of time.</p><p>Seeing that she didn't need to waste more words on him, the Empress Dowager was quite satisfied with Jiang Juan's timeliness. She let a maid help her sit down and started leisurely drinking tea.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at her and then around the environment. Spying a place covered with soft red velvet carpet, he suddenly dropped the pen from his hand with a "clatter."</p><p>In the next second, Jiang Juan put his hand on the table and frowned, saying, "... My heart feels really painful."</p><p>With his fingers slowly tightening around his chest, Jiang Juan took shallow breaths and gradually lowered himself. His forehead touched the table, motionless as if he was in extreme pain.</p><p>The Empress Dowager was startled and remembered Jiang Juan's heart condition. She abruptly stood up, "Someone, quickly come!"</p><p>The palace maids rushed over just then, while outside Cining Palace, a commotion erupted.</p><p>"Prince, Her Majesty the Empress Dowager has summoned you; you may not enter!"</p><p>"Prince! Prince——!"</p><p>"Her Majesty the Empress Dowager, Prince has barged in!"</p><p>Footsteps and cries echoed one after another, creating chaos everywhere. Jiang Juan fell onto the soft red carpet as he wished, without even hurting himself.</p><p>Feigning illness was his specialty.</p><p>He played a seasoned heart disease patient well.</p><p>Jiang Juan lay still, pretending to be dead, unaware that someone had entered Cining Palace in big strides. The man's sleeves flapped in the wind and nearly lifted the trailing hem of his robe.</p><p>"Bang——!"</p><p>In the next moment, Xue Fangli stepped into the room expressionlessly.</p><p>"Where is this Prince's Consort?"</p><p>He smiled, with a vicious look on his face. His eyes were bloodshot as if he had crawled out from hell itself, radiating an aura of hostility.</p>
