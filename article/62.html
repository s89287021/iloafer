						<p>Prince Wang&8204; He flew into a rage, leaving Jiang Juan feeling quite bewildered. He sat there in a daze for a long time, barely reacting when the maid brought him a hand warmer to dry his clothes and hair. It wasn't until the curtain was lifted again and someone entered that Jiang Juan regained consciousness: "Prince Wang..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Su Feiyue&8204; He smiled, followed by Supervisor Wang and the imperial physician.</p><p>Upon seeing Jiang Juan's pitiful state, Supervisor Wang exclaimed, "Princess Consort, you must take care of yourself. Your constitution is not good."</p><p>He hurriedly came forward to take the hand warmer from the maid, beginning to dry Jiang Juan's hair. At Su Feiyue's signal, the imperial physician proceeded to examine Jiang Juan's pulse.</p><p>"Princess Consort has nothing serious wrong with her, but... your clothes can be dried, although it will take some time. Princess Consort should quickly bathe to avoid catching a chill."</p><p>That's good to hear, Su Feiyue nodded. He glanced at Jiang Juan, who still looked listless, and sat beside him, whispering gently, "Don't overthink things... I rather think that your perspective..."</p><p>Su Feiyue smiled knowingly: "Is quite interesting."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback and asked, "Did you hear?"</p><p>Su Feiyue responded with a nod and without hiding his thoughts: "I am human, as is Your Excellency, but—"</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Su Feiyue continued: "Since you act this way, I assume you don't like driving others away. However, one must do one's best in all things. Prince Wang is capable, and if he weren't here to pull you back in time or if the guards arrived late, what would you have done?"</p><p>"Being kind-hearted is commendable, but take care of yourself as well."</p><p>His gentle tone and persuasive words resonated with Jiang Juan, who nodded: "Alright, I remember."</p><p>Su Feiyue looked at him and teased, "Fortunately, your words didn't reach Fu Ying; otherwise, she might not be able to sleep tonight."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked blankly, "Why wouldn't she be able to sleep?"</p><p>Sophie Yue gazed at Jiang Juan with a gentle expression, "Mou and Fu Ying both highly admire Mr. Wuliu very much."</p><p>Mr. Wuliu? Tao Yuanming?</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes. Sophie Yue recited, “...The fields are crisscrossed, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard. Among them, the people going back and forth, men and women's clothing, all resemble outsiders. Elders with hanging hair and young children, they are all content and happy.”</p><p>Jiang Juan had memorized the entire piece, "The Peach Blossom Spring Record."</p><p>Sophie Yue exclaimed in admiration, "Very good, it is indeed this one, have you read it?"</p><p>After asking, he laughed himself, "Since you have such thoughts, you must have read this. We share similar interests."</p><p>Sophie Yue explained for Jiang Juan. After thinking, Jiang Juan did not refute and acknowledged quietly. Just as Sophie Yue was about to say something else to him, someone came over, peeking outside cautiously.</p><p>"Big Brother Juan! Big Brother Juan!"</p><p>Xue Jin had inquired that his fifth brother was not around before he sneaked over again, "Auntie and Jiang Qingliang, you brought the cat, come quickly..."</p><p>He suddenly spotted Sophie Yue and quickly stood up straight, afraid of being scolded, "Uncle."</p><p>Sophie Yue nodded with a smile, asking Jiang Juan, "Are you here to find you?"</p><p>Hearing Xue Jin mention the cat, Jiang Juan fell into melancholy once more. He thought about the Prince and simply replied with an "um." Sophie Yue patted his shoulder, "Go out and take a walk together."</p><p>Jiang Juan did not want to go at first, but after being comforted by Sophie Yue for so long, he agreed quietly, "Okay."</p><p>"Then we won't keep you," Sophie Yue said, "The Emperor will let him come see. Since you have nothing to do, I will report this to him now."</p><p>Sophie Yue stood up, and since Jiang Juan was going out with Xue Jin, he did not maintain that solemn expression everywhere. The hot water was already ready, so Jiang Juan took a bath.</p><p>In no time, he dressed himself up, and Xue Jin immediately dragged him away.</p><p>When they arrived, Jiang Qingliang sat on a tree, having an argument with Gu Puwang.</p><p>Of course, he was arguing one-sidedly with Gu Puwang.</p><p>"Gu, you are truly wily and cunning, with extremely malicious intentions. Just what were you fishing for in broad daylight? Turns out your plan was this."</p><p>"Is it wrong to be a good person?"</p><p>Gu Puwang ignored him, simply sitting on the ground with an overturned basket beside him. He held onto the basket, occasionally a furry paw peeking out.</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "What's going on?"</p><p>Xue Jun waved his hand, "Nothing, nothing."</p><p>While he said that, Xue Jun's face fell.</p><p>This matter would have to be settled by him being punished. After getting off scot-free, Xue Jun hurriedly ran to the racetrack. It wasn't a big deal if he didn't go, but once he did, he caught Jiang Qingliang on the spot.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang. Fifth Brother came without warning him, yet now Jiang Qingliang sneaked into the racetrack. This was truly outrageous.</p><p>Xue Jun almost got into a fight with him, but after much ado, they finally agreed that whoever won the horse race would be their joint prize.</p><p>The result—</p><p>After running around frantically, they managed to catch this four-eared cat and planned to show it off to Gu Puwang. But who knew the cat, upon seeing him, straightaway approached Gu Puwang. They reached out to grab it but backed away, and the leisurely Gu Puwang slowly revealed a smile: "Count it as our joint prize."</p><p>What were they to do.</p><p>If they refused, this cat wouldn't let go of Gu Puwang, but even if Gu Puwang took his share, who could blame him for fishing with fishy intentions.</p><p>When they arrived at their destination, Jiang Qingliang perched on a tree and was having an argument with Gu Puwang. </p><p>Of course, it was a one-sided argument.</p><p>"Gu, you are truly cunning and malicious. Just what were you fishing for in broad daylight? It turns out your plan was this."</p><p>"Aren't I being a good person?"</p><p>Gu Puwang ignored him, simply sitting on the ground next to an overturned basket. He held onto the basket, occasionally revealing a furry paw.</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "What's going on?"</p><p>Xue Jun waved his hand, "Nothing, nothing."</p><p>While he said that, Xue Jun’s face fell.</p><p>This matter would have to be settled by him being punished. After escaping punishment, Xue Jun hurriedly ran to the racetrack. It wasn’t a big deal if he didn't go, but once he did, he caught Jiang Qingliang on the spot.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang. Fifth Brother came without warning him, yet now Jiang Qingliang sneaked into the racetrack.

Even if Gu Puwang took his share, who could blame him for fishing with fishy intentions?</p><p>Upon arriving at their destination, Jiang Qingliang perched on a tree, engaged in a heated argument with Gu Puwang.</p><p>Of course, the argument was decidedly one-sided.</p><p>"Gu, you are truly cunning and malicious. Just what were you fishing for in broad daylight? Your real intention was something else entirely."</p><p>"Aren't I being a good person?"</p><p>Gu Puwang ignored him, simply sitting on the ground beside an overturned basket. He held onto the basket, occasionally revealing a furry paw.</p><p>Jiang Juan curiously asked, "What's going on?"</p><p>Xue Jun waved his hand dismissively, "Nothing, nothing."</p><p>While he said that, Xue Jun’s face fell into a frown.</p><p>This matter would have to be settled by him being punished. After escaping punishment, Xue Jun hurriedly ran to the racetrack. It wasn’t a big deal if he didn't go, but once he did, he caught Jiang Qingliang on the spot.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang—fifth brother had come without warning him—and now Jiang Qingliang sneaked into the racetrack. This was truly outrageous.</p><p>Xue Jun almost got into a fight with him, but after much ado, they finally agreed that whoever won the horse race would be their joint prize.</p><p>The result—</p><p>After running around frantically, they managed to catch this four-eared cat and planned to show it off to Gu Puwang.

They reached out to grab it but backed away, and the leisurely Gu Puwang slowly revealed a smile: "Count it as our joint prize."</p><p>What were they to do.</p><p>If they refused, this cat wouldn’t let go of Gu Puwang. Even if Gu Puwang took his share, who could blame him for fishing with fishy intentions?</p><p>The cat smelled the scent and wouldn't leave.</p><p>But not telling Jiang Juan this would be embarrassing, Xue ?n changed her mind and said, "The cat is in the basket, all three of us brought it here together."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't pay attention to the details. He walked over, squatted down, and looked at the cat hiding in the basket.</p><p>It was a small marmot, just as Xue ?n had said, with four ears, big ears containing smaller ones.</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to touch it but was afraid the marmot would be scared of him. Gu Pu noticed this and took the marmot out of the basket.</p><p>Thanks to the fish smell on his hand, the marmot didn't panic but only lowered its head to sniff Gu Pu's hand. Gu Pu then said to Jiang Juan, "You can touch it; it seems in a good mood."</p><p>Jiang Juan reached out and carefully touched the marmot. He was too curious about those two ears and immediately gently played with them, feeling much better himself. He sighed, "It's so cute."</p><p>Having finished, Jiang Juan said to Gu Pu, "You're really good at making cats like you."</p><p>Gu Pu: "Alright."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Xue ?n: "..."</p><p>Damn dog!</p><p>Both Jiang Qingliang and Xue ?n cursed inwardly.</p><p>At the same time, they both suddenly felt a sense of crisis.</p><p>Jiang Juan and Gu Pu were like two pieces of salt fish who appreciated each other, certainly possessing the tacit understanding that comes with being like-minded outcasts. However, Xue ?n and Jiang Qingliang were unaware of this and had once felt like outsiders. They immediately decided to forcefully join in.</p><p>"Āmā mō."</p><p>"Mō yī qié."</p><p>Jiāng Juàn still had his people, so they joined in the commotion. Little Li Hua finally became afraid and rolled into the basket, peering out warily; it could no longer be touched.</p><p>Xuě Yún rubbed his nose and pushed the pot without hesitation, "It's all Jiǎng Qīngliáng's fault. With one fierce look, he scared the cat away."</p><p>Jiǎng Qīngliáng rolled his eyes at him, "Just because it got scared, does that mean you're a cat too? Are you saying you're the one who scared it? Or perhaps you made it run away with your stupidity?"</p><p>Xuě Yún pounced on him and pinched his arm, "Say sorry. The prince says sorry."</p><p>Jiāng Juàn replied, "I angered the Prince."</p><p>Gù Pǔwàng asked, "What happened?"</p><p>Jiāng Juàn explained the incident briefly, and after a few moments of silence, Gù Pǔwàng commented, "Your idea is quite unique."</p><p>Xià Mǎ didn't say anything. Jiāng Juàn asked him, "Are you very curious?"</p><p>Jiāng Juàn already knew the answer: "Forget it, don't bother with him; he knows."</p><p>Xià Mǎ was still a minority because of different educational systems. In his time, everyone was equal, but in this era, there were clear social hierarchies.</p><p>Jiāng Juàn said slowly, "He's just angry."</p><p>He furrowed his brow, pursing his lips, and looked at Gù Pǔwàng blankly, "What should I do?"</p><p>Gù Pǔwàng glanced at him and confidently replied, "Act helpless."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, her eyebrows furrowing even more. "Ah? ! Wont'ao."</p><p>Gu Puwang nodded slowly, " , That's right."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>What is this?</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to ask further when she suddenly heard a scream, followed by the sound of a woman's angry voice.</p><p>"Come here, Gong Naya! This damn animal!"</p><p>Jiang Juan looked in the direction of the voice. The woman was wearing an exquisite dress with a single plum blossom on her forehead. She seemed to have been frightened and kept gently patting her chest. A wicker basket rolled towards her feet, which was Xiao Lihua's basket.</p><p>— Jiang Juan was seeking help from Gu Puwang while Xue Jun was playing around with Jiang Qingliang; neither of them noticed Xiao Lihua. The cat got carried away playing and the basket rolled far away, seemingly colliding into the woman.</p><p>— It wasn't just a collision; it wasn't entirely so.</p><p>The woman said angrily, "Are you deaf? Gong Ping sheng hates cats and dogs all his life. Why did you still bump into it? That's bad luck! Don't come slow, Gong will dig its eyes out!"</p><p>She was furious. Not only Jiang Juan and Gu Puwang, even Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang stopped playing. Xue Jun hurriedly said, "Empress Mei, this is my cat!"</p><p>The one who came was Empress Mei. Whether it was Jiang Qingliang or Gu Puwang, they didn't dare to speak; only Xue Jun approached. Xue Jun smiled slyly, "If you don't like cats, I'll take it away right now so as not to bother your eyes."</p><p>"Where did this wild cat come from in the imperial stables?" Empress Mei glanced at him, "This is the cat you won in the racetrack just now?"</p><p>With these words from Empress Mei, Xue Jun understood.</p><p>— Whatever cat bumped into her and whatever bad luck, she was looking for trouble specifically.</p><p>Empress Mei had a fiery personality; she loved to compete and win. Not only did she love to compete herself, but she also loved to see her brother win.</p><p>In the recent horse race, his elder brother participated but was far behind by Xue Yun. He didn't like his elder brother because of Mei Fei. Every time, it was his elder brother who lacked skills, yet Mei Fei always found fault. Xue Yun tried to avoid his elder brother, but Juan Ge wanted the cat, so couldn't he try his best? Xue Yun said with a smirk, "It wasn’t a win; it just happened to be lucky." "Madam Mei Fei, please don’t dig out its eyeballs. This is a four-ear cat, a divine cat bestowed by Emperor Father. I wish to take it back and raise it for some time." Xue Yun bit down heavily on the words ‘bestowed by Emperor Father’ so that Mei Fei wouldn’t dare to dig out its eyes again. Such an action would be disrespectful. Mei Fei understood his intentions, snorted, "Divine cat?" "It has four ears and understands human nature," Xue Yun explained. "The locals call it a divine cat." "So what." Mei Fei nodded her head. She looked at the little kitty in the basket, deep in thought, and said, "Gongzhu yesterday went to Cining Palace to pay respects to Empress Dowager. Empress Dowager was still with Gongzhu. This place is quite desolate. If I want a small, obedient pet for company, why not send this cat to accompany Empress Dowager?" "You are fond of playing around. You might not be able to take care of the cat for long once the novelty wears off. It would be better if it enjoys its days by Empress Dowager." Xue Yun was momentarily at a loss for words. If Mei Fei had asked him directly, he could have chuckled and refused. However, she mentioned his grandmother. If he refused and word got to her, his mother would be in trouble. His mother being in trouble meant Xue Yun’s ruin. The cat would have been fine if it belonged to him, but it was brought by Juan Ge! He had promised to take it to play with Juan Ge whenever the fifth brother wasn’t around and also improve their relationship. Everything fell apart at this point. Xue Yun was caught between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>"Come, then he won't have any cats to play with. But if I don't agree, his stepmother will definitely punish him.</p><p>However, from start to finish, he never thought about telling the truth—Jiang Juan is the one who raised the cat. After all, his 'elder brother' looks frail and loves crying. If Princess Mei were to challenge him, he might end up in tears.</p><p>Amidst the tense atmosphere, someone suddenly spoke up with a clear voice.</p><p>It was Jiang Juan who spoke. He had seen the Empress Dowager before and was even forced to copy scriptures, so he remembered very clearly.</p><p>Jiang Juan's words made Xue Yun realize her mistake. Her grandmother did mention it, but she would never take this cat to her grandmother, as the cat would inevitably end up in Princess Mei's hands!</p><p>She was now shouting for someone to dig out eyeballs; if the cat fell into her hands, who knew how she would vent her anger and torment it.</p><p>"Oh, is that so?"</p><p>Princess Mei smiled. "Do you mean the palace is lying?"</p><p>She had a vague memory of Xue Yun from when they were acquaintances. When she glanced over, she hadn't really paid much attention. It was only when Jiang Juan spoke that she realized he was a stranger's face. Princess Mei asked with a half-smile, "Are you...?"</p><p>Xue Yun hurriedly replied, "The Wangfei of my fifth brother!"</p><p>At this moment, her fifth brother was particularly useful. Whether inside or outside the palace, everyone had some fear of him. Xue Yun shouted loudly, afraid that Princess Mei wouldn't hear.</p><p>Princess Mei's hand concealed in her sleeves clenched tightly, and an endless hatred surged within her. However, she smiled sweetly. "Wangfei Li."</p><p>She was fiercely competitive. In her youth, she was one of the favored concubines in the palace until Yu Meiniang entered it, losing favor overnight and enduring cold glances and mockery.</p><p>Later, when Yu Meiniang passed away, she finally climbed back to power. But alas, her son—Xue Chaohua—could never gain the Emperor's affection. Just as much as she hated Yu Meiniang in her youth, she now hated Xue Fangli equally.</p><p>This mother and son pair truly was annoying!</p><p>After a pause, Mei Fei raised her eyebrow and said, "You think Empress Dowager believes in Buddhism, so she shouldn't want to keep cats? Are you suggesting she lied about it in the palace?"</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head and honestly replied, "Maybe you didn't know; I'm just reminding you."</p><p>"Empress Dowager wants a listening toy that can talk. She probably wants Consort Mei to visit her more often."</p><p>She had been trying to bring up the topic, but this "The palace understands" sounded like Jiang Juan was scolding her. Mei Fei nodded obediently.</p><p>Xue Yü found it hilarious and almost burst out laughing, hastily covering her mouth with her sleeve.</p><p>No matter how quick his reaction was, a snort escaped him, which Mei Fei heard immediately. Her face fell, looking rather unhappy.</p><p>"In any case," Mei Fei said slowly, "Since Empress Dowager mentioned it, the palace must pay more attention to her wishes. Yü this cat is indeed cute. Whether Empress Dowager keeps it or not is her decision. How can you overstep?"</p><p>"Why doesn't Yü say anything? Could it be he's unwilling to give the cat to Empress Dowager?"</p><p>Here we go again.</p><p>Xue Yü felt his scalp tingling. He knew very well that his grandmother was just using an excuse, and Mei Fei wanted to take the cat to torment her. But he couldn't voice this directly.</p><p>What could he do?</p><p>How should he respond?</p><p>Xue Yü scratched his head in desperation.</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him; no matter what happened, the cat was a result of Xue Yü and his friends' hard-earned efforts. If the Empress Dowager wanted it, she should ask Xue Yü for it directly rather than Mei Fei trying to play a trick.</p><p>He gently said, “Princess Mei, the Sixth Prince is not reluctant to part with it. He just cannot make a decision about this cat; he... gave it to the Duke.”</p><p>“If you want it, you can ask the Duke for it.”</p><p>Jiang Juan was eager to help Xue Jun and could only tell a harmless little lie.</p><p>He thought it simple: Xue Jun is not the owner of the cat, and the Duke is not present, so he naturally cannot make a decision. Princess Mei wouldn’t go out of her way just for a cat.</p><p>Princess Mei indeed would not go out of her way to find Xue Fangli for a cat.</p><p>However, hearing this, she wanted the cat even more.</p><p>Princess Mei: “Gave it to the Duke? That’s perfect; no need to ask him. You are his duchess, you can make the decision on his behalf.”</p><p>Jiang Juan: “I...”</p><p>“Why don’t you?” Princess Mei covered her mouth and smiled, “You are his lawfully wedded duchess, surely you shouldn’t be unable to deal with even a cat, right?”</p><p>If Jiang Juan got provoked and dealt with the cat on his own, Duke Li surely would not let him off easily.</p><p>“Since you are close to the palace, you are greatly favored by the Duke,” Princess Mei said, “He won’t even let you take a single step without him. This kind of favoritism is just for a cat.”</p><p>These were naturally things she heard from Xue Chaohua’s mouth. However, Princess Mei did not care. Even when Emperor Hongxing doted on her, there were still matters she could not interfere with. How much more so was it with Xue Fangli, a complete madman.</p><p>“How about saving the Duke’s face? What do you think?”</p><p>Princess Mei smiled gently and waited for Jiang Juan to make his choice.</p><p>But Jiang Juan said, “Even a cat cannot be disposed of.”</p><p>What face did Jiang Juan care about? He shook his head, "No, you should ask the Prince yourself."</p><p>Empress Mei froze, stared at him for a moment, and was rendered speechless by Jiang Juan's candor again.</p><p>Wanting to disgust Xue Fangli, why did it end up frustrating her repeatedly?</p><p>Empress Mei was never an easy person to deal with. After receiving a lesson from Jiang Juan, she had now lost face again. Finally unable to hold back, she retracted her smile and said coldly, "You have stayed in the countryside for too long, even less knowledgeable than those rustic villagers. It’s understandable if you don’t know the rules, but you are rather clueless. Upon meeting you today, it turns out to be true."</p><p>"Palace and imperial courtesies should not be taken lightly by you! You do not yield at all; what a grand attitude!"</p><p>Empress Mei said angrily, "Bring this beast away!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was about to speak when someone beside Empress Mei stepped forward. It seemed he saw someone and respectfully said, "Greetings, Prince."</p><p>Empress Mei's expression changed. A man slowly approached. His original robe had covered Jiang Juan, but now he wore a dark cloak that trailed on the ground. His expression was extremely cold and vicious, "Imperial Consort Mei, did the Prince misunderstand something?"</p><p>"You, as the Prince’s consort, do not know right from wrong?"</p><p>He calmly said, "The Prince feels that you are truly clueless."</p>
