						<p>The bitter taste on the tip of his tongue was suppressed, and sweet honey filled his mouth.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt slightly better, but he had already bitten Xue Fangli's finger. After careful consideration, he decided to take another bite.</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan did not bite hard; his teeth gently grazed over it, more like playing than retaliating.</p><p>After biting enough, he used the tip of his tongue to press against it, trying to push it away.</p><p>With moist breath, Xue Fangli should have withdrawn his hand, but the soft sensation at the tip was too tempting, so he did not move.</p><p>Pushing once did not work; Jiang Juan tried several times. No matter how hard his tongue pressed, the force was no more than that of a cat's, unable to push it away. Jiang Juan could only lift his head to look at Xue Fangli.</p><p>He held his finger in his mouth, his lips slightly parted, looking rather bewildered and unsure why someone would prefer being bitten to letting go.</p><p>After staring down at him for a long time, Xue Fangli smiled lightly, "Not biting anymore?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded sullenly. He had had enough of biting, but the prince seemed too cooperative, making it seem as if he had not managed to retaliate at all.</p><p>Xue Fangli withdrew his hand and casually glanced at it, water droplets still glistening on his fingers, and the tingling sensation from the tip of Jiang Juan's tongue had yet to fade.</p><p>Many indescribable desires were aroused in this moment.</p><p>Xue Fangli nonchalantly twirled his finger and took the towel handed by the servant, wiping his hands leisurely.</p><p>Jiang Juan released the honey candy, his voice muffled, "It's bitter. You didn't tell me the truth on purpose to lower my guard."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, "If I didn't coax you, how would you have submitted?"</p><p>Jiang Juan disagreed and corrected him, "You tricked me into drinking, not coaxed me into it."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his eyebrows slightly, looked at Jiang Juan a few times, then laughed softly, "I understand. Next time, I'll use coaxing."</p><p>The bitter taste on the tip of his tongue was suppressed, and honey-like sweetness filled his mouth.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt somewhat relieved, but he had already bitten Xue Fangli's finger. After some thought, he decided to take another bite.</p><p>This time, Jiang Juan did not bite hard; his teeth merely grazed it, more like play than revenge.</p><p>After biting enough, he pressed the tip of his tongue against it, trying to push it away.</p><p>With moist breath, Xue Fangli should have withdrawn his hand, but the soft sensation at the tip was too tempting, so he did not move.</p><p>Pushing once failed; Jiang Juan tried several times.

Next time, I'll use coaxing."</p><p>He put on a show of being humble and willing to learn, but Jiang Juan was not in the mood. The moment he tried again, he immediately flopped onto the bed, sprawling like a sad salted fish cake.</p><p>"Get up, it's time for dinner."</p><p>Before he knew it, the servants had already set the table with food. Jiang Juan slowly sat up as an arm wrapped around his waist, and Xue Fangli lifted him up and placed him in his arms once more.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "……"</p><p>He raised his head and asked softly, "Prince Wang, didn't you promise me that you wouldn't stop holding me just like that?"</p><p>Xue Fangli hesitated for a moment before responding calmly, "Let's talk about it tomorrow. You've had another heart attack today; now is the time when you're most vulnerable."</p><p>"Alright," Jiang Juan reluctantly agreed.</p><p>In any case, it was the last day of the human-shaped pillow operation, and Jiang Juan cooperated—sitting in Prince Wang's arms for him to hold and accepting various offerings with grace.</p><p>However, as he ate, Jiang Juan suddenly bit down on the tip of his chopstick.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned. "Why do you always bite things?"</p><p>Jiang Juan thought his accusation was unreasonable; he hadn't bitten anything random. But that wasn't the point. He asked curiously, "Prince Wang, why do you only feed me and not yourself?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied apathetically, "I have no appetite."</p><p>Jiang Juan looked at him, picked up a silver chopstick, and picked up a piece of eight-treasure tofu to offer him, "You have an appetite."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes but still showed no intention of eating. Jiang Juan could only say, "Prince Wang, my chest still hurts."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan dramatically touched his chest, "You're not a fairy; I don't allow you to drink dew alone."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked into his eyes. Although the youth threatened him with words, his brow was knitted in worry, his expression filled with pure concern and affection, so pure that it almost made him drown in it.</p><p>No one knew how long passed, but Xue Fangli eventually gave in. He lowered his head, eating a mouthful with a weary expression.</p><p>The reverse feeding was successful.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt satisfied and quite accomplished, intending to give the Prince more, when Manager Wang returned at that moment.</p><p>He bowed politely and asked Xue Fangli softly, "Your Highness, His Majesty ordered me to come and ask... "</p><p>Manager Wang lowered his head. "When you were young, it seemed that you had a great interest in painting and often created artwork. Your Highness, I would like to ask if those paintings are still around?"</p><p>Xue Fangli suddenly raised his eyelids, looking at him with a detached expression.</p><p>There was no change in his demeanor; he looked just as usual, only adding a touch of coldness and sarcasm. Manager Wang, even though bowed low, could feel a chill running up his spine, involuntarily shivering.</p><p>How could he not know that the Prince usually did not like to bring up old matters? But—</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent, so Manager Wang could only wait.</p><p>A long silence ensued; the spoon hit the edge of something, producing a crisp "ding" sound. Jiang Juan picked it up and brought it close to Xue Fangli's lips, continuing his reverse feeding, "Your Highness, have some soup."</p><p>Manager Wang was startled.</p><p>"Princess—!"</p><p>Though Manager Wang had only met Jiang Juan twice, he had quite a good impression of her, so he could not help but stop him, saying, "Your Highness does not like..."</p><p>His voice paused. As the head eunuch, Manager Wang naturally knew his limits, what to say and what not to say.</p><p>He had intended to say, the Prince was quite picky about his food. If the Prince wanted to eat, he would just pick up his chopsticks——although, at times, the Prince only ate out of necessity, forcing himself to maintain his spirit and strength. If the Prince did not wish to use his chopsticks, no matter how good-hearted the Princess Consort was, it would be futile, and she might even anger the Prince.</p><p>When the Prince went on a rampage, there was truly no one who could stop him; moreover, the Princess Consort had just fallen ill with heart disease and could not afford any shocks.</p><p>"Ah?"</p><p>Jiang Juan raised her head, looking at Wang Zongguan in confusion.</p><p>Wang Zongguan did not want to explain it directly to her, so he only shook his head at Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan did not understand his meaning and thought for a moment, feeling tired from holding her hand up for too long, deciding to finish the Prince’s meal before talking further.</p><p>"Prince," Jiang Juan said, "hurry up and drink, my hand hurts."</p><p>Xue Fali slowly lowered his eyes, as if he were seeing not a spoonful of soup but something that deeply repulsed him. Seeing Wang Zongguan’s displeased expression, Wang Zongguan almost felt like sweating for Jiang Juan.</p><p>The Princess Consort truly is——</p><p>truly is——</p><p>Before Wang Zongguan could find the right words, he saw the Prince coldly nod his head and drink the spoonful of chicken soup with displeasure.</p><p>Wang Zongguan: "?"</p><p>Did the Prince really drink it?</p><p>What surprised Wang Zongguan even more was what happened next. After Xue Fali drank the chicken soup, he looked up at Jiang Juan and asked, "Does your heart still hurt?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, speaking without any shame, "Not necessarily. If the Prince finishes this meal properly, it probably won’t hurt anymore. If the Prince doesn’t eat well, it might hurt."</p><p>Xue Fali: "…"</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>He had intended to say that the Prince was quite picky about his food. If the Prince felt like eating, he would simply lift his chopsticks——though at times, the Prince only ate out of necessity, forcing himself to maintain his strength and energy. Should the Prince not wish to eat, no matter how benevolent the Princess Consort might be, it would be futile; it could even anger the Prince.</p><p>When the Prince was in a rage, there was truly no one who could stand up to him; moreover, the Princess Consort had just fallen ill with heart disease and could not afford any frights.</p><p>"Ah?"</p><p>Jiang Juan raised her head, looking at Wang Zongguan in confusion.</p><p>Wang Zongguan did not wish to explain it directly to Jiang Juan, so he merely shook his head. Jiang Juan did not understand what he meant and thought for a moment, feeling tired from holding her hand up for too long, deciding to finish the Prince’s meal first before continuing.</p><p>"Prince," Jiang Juan said, "hurry up and drink; my hand hurts."</p><p>Xue Fali slowly lowered his eyes, as if he saw not a spoonful of soup but something that deeply repulsed him. Seeing Wang Zongguan’s displeased expression, Wang Zongguan felt like sweating for Jiang Juan.</p><p>The Princess Consort is truly——</p><p>truly——</p><p>Before Wang Zongguan could find the right words, he saw the Prince coldly nod his head and drink the spoonful of chicken soup with displeasure.</p><p>Wang Zongguan: "?"</p><p>Did the Prince actually drink it?</p><p>What surprised Wang Zongguan even more was what happened next. After Xue Fali drank the chicken soup, he looked up at Jiang Juan and asked, "Does your heart still hurt?"</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked her eyes, speaking without any shame, "Not necessarily.

If the Prince finishes his meal properly, it probably won’t hurt anymore. If the Prince doesn’t eat well, it might hurt."</p><p>Xue Fali: "…"</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>Xue Fangli gave a half-hearted glance at him, naturally understanding the true intention behind Jiang Juan's actions. He picked up the silver chopsticks, although he wasn't very hungry, he still tasted each bite.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked with a hint of disappointment, "Your Highness, don't you need me to feed you anymore?"</p><p>His reverse-feeding was actually quite enjoyable—though His Highness had no appetite, he insisted on forcing himself to eat, thus making His Highness consume his meal, which gave him a great sense of satisfaction.</p><p>"No need," Xue Fangli said indifferently, "Your hands will hurt from holding them up for too long."</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered an "oh" and decided not to feed him. He looked back at Manager Wang and asked, "Manager Wang, were you going to say something?"</p><p>Manager Wang glanced at Jiang Juan and then at Xue Fangli, who was slowly eating with a nearly regal posture. It took him a long time before he shook his head and said with a chuckle, "No, I must have misinterpreted."</p><p>Indeed, he hadn't expected His Highness to be so averse to food that he would even eat the food fed to him by the Empress.</p><p>He also hadn't expected His Highness to force himself to eat out of fear of displeasing the Empress.</p><p>Jiang Juan seemed to believe him and nodded.</p><p>Since he had already been fed earlier and was nearly full, being held in his arms with no way to escape, he could only lower his head and play with the pastries. Soon after Xue Fangli put down the silver chopsticks, Jiang Juan suddenly said excitedly, "Your Highness, is the painting Manager Wang mentioned still there? I also want to see it."</p><p>Manager Wang's breath hitched.</p><p>He finally thought of a word that perfectly described the Empress.</p><p>—Opening the can of worms.</p><p>However, no matter what, he couldn't blame the Empress. After all, there were many things he was unaware of.</p><p>The painting Manager Wang came back with and requested His Highness to fetch was actually a portrait of Yu Meiniang.</p><p>Manager Wang wouldn't dare to remind him again this time, fearing it would backfire. He could only stand silently by his side with his hands hanging down.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan pulled on Xue Fangli's sleeve, turning her head to look at him with curiosity in her eyes. "I really want to see it."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke calmly, without any extra emotion. "After so many years, this prince has forgotten where he put it."</p><p>After she finished pulling, Jiang Juan, who rarely gave up easily, said, "Can you try finding it again?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied, "There's nothing very special about it."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Then I still want to see it."</p><p>He shook his head gently, his voice soft and almost unconsciously tender.</p><p>It was so soft that it seemed to melt into her heart.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan but didn't immediately speak. Seeing that he had no intention of responding, she let go of his sleeve and slowly frowned, placing a hand over her chest. "Prince, I feel... kind of unwell."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyelids, staring at her calmly.</p><p>Wang Zongguan: "... "</p><p>The Empress Dowager was truly arrogant when ill.</p><p>When the Prince said he had forgotten where he put it, he was politely declining the Empress Dowager's request. However, she insisted anyway. To add to that, even when Wang Zongguan first mentioned the matter, the Prince didn't respond—indicating his unwillingness to retrieve the painting.</p><p>This time, Wang Zongguan truly believed the Prince wouldn't give in.</p><p>After all, it was the Prince's mother, and he hated everything about his past intensely.</p><p>Thinking of this, Administrator Wang sighed silently.</p><p>But at last, Xue Fangli finally spoke up. His tone was casual, his voice light.</p><p>"Then let's see it," Xue Fangli said, "This king will send someone to fetch the painting."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Administrator Wang was utterly bewildered.</p><p>Did the King actually agree?</p><p>Would the King actually comply with Queen Consort’s wish to see a painting?</p><p>Jiang Juan, unaware of the circumstances, smiled knowingly and sincerely said, "Your Highness, you're truly good."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his head, half-smiling, "Once, this excuse may no longer hold water."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked his eyes guiltlessly, looking at him, "What excuse? I really feel unwell."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him and stood up to give some instructions. But Jiang Juan immediately seized the opportunity to ask Administrator Wang, "Eunuch Wang, what were you going to say just now?"</p><p>"The King doesn't like...?"</p><p>Administrator Wang was taken aback, then realized something, and asked in disbelief, "Queen Consort, do you really want to see a painting just to get rid of the King and inquire about this matter from me?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, "I feel that you were going to say something important just now."</p><p>Administrator Wang: "... "</p><p>What should he say?</p><p>He had merely wanted to remind Queen Consort that the King was not eating. But even if the King refused food, it wasn't an issue in front of Queen Consort.</p><p>It was merely for Wang Fei to clarify this matter that, in a situation of ignorance, she inadvertently provoked the Prince's wrath even further. To her surprise, the Prince readily agreed.</p><p>Thinking about it, Manager Wang's expression was rather complicated. Considering that these matters could be told to Jiang Juan as well, he carefully chose his words and said, "The Prince has always had some complexes regarding food, which are related to his mother."</p><p>"When the Prince was young..."</p><p>Manager Wang really did not know how to continue, so he stammered for a while. Jiang Juan, however, remembered something and asked Manager Wang, "Was the Prince fed human flesh by his mother?"</p><p>Manager Wang was taken aback. "Does the Princess Consort know about this?"</p><p>In reality, it went even further than that.</p><p>Manager Wang whispered, "Due to certain reasons, Beauty Yu treated the Prince poorly. Besides feeding him human flesh, she also often poisoned him..."</p><p>After Xue Fangli finished her instructions and returned, he lazily stretched out his hand to hug Jiang Juan. This time, Jiang Juan did not say anything; if he wanted a hug, he could take it.</p><p>Jiang Juan, for the first time in his life, did not declare that he did not want to be hugged. Xue Fangli looked at him thoughtfully and said, "Nothing."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an "Oh" and lowered his head, lost in thought. After a while, he suddenly asked Xue Fangli, "Prince, why are you so averse to food?"</p><p>Xue Fangli was startled and recalled the matter, smiling carelessly. "You've had enough to eat."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyelashes twitched, and he looked up at him with eyes full of compassion and sorrow, as if he understood all the hardships and the pain behind them.</p><p>Jiang Juan gently held onto the hand resting on his waist. "Prince, you are lying."</p><p>He spoke very slowly, "Prince, I am feeling a bit unwell."</p>
