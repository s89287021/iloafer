						<p>Jiang Nian had a dream.</p><p>In the dream, officials crawled on the ground, their voices of welcome resounding as Duke of Anping entered the magnificent hall. He pulled Jiang Nian, who was standing by his side, and smiled, "This is my empress."</p><p>Jiang Nian walked to the high place with Duke of Anping. Looking down at the kneeling officials, he took in the vast landscape.</p><p>Standing atop the pinnacle of power, all his years of longing were finally realized. Jiang Nian felt immense satisfaction in his heart.</p><p>In his previous life, he missed out on becoming empress and died in depression.</p><p>This time, he had finally obtained everything.</p><p>He wanted it all, and now he had it.</p><p>With a "splash," a bucket of cold water splashed onto Jiang Nian's face, chilling him to the bone.</p><p>Jiang Nian opened his eyes, and the vast landscape and kneeling officials vanished in an instant. At that moment, his hands were bound, and his feet were shackled together. The guard shouted, "Down!"</p><p>Before Jiang Nian could react, he was roughly pushed out of the carriage, almost rolling off. With a "thud," he fell to the ground.</p><p>The fall hurt Jiang Nian severely. He clutched his ankle, in pain so intense that he nearly couldn't speak. The guard ignored him and merely urged, "Get up! You should be on your way!"</p><p>Jiang Nian tried to move but felt a searing pain. He couldn't stand up at all, "I can't move..."</p><p>"My ankle is sprained."</p><p>Tears streamed down Jiang Nian's face, his agony unmistakable. The guard looked at him for a moment and pointed at Duke of Anping, "You—carry him."</p><p>Jiang Nian's hands and feet were shackled, as was Duke of Anping's. It was already difficult for them to walk; carrying another person was impossible. Upon hearing this, his face turned grim.</p><p>"Hold it in."</p><p>Anping Marquis Zhan Wei came, his face dark and frightening.</p><p>He slapped Jiang Nian so hard that Jiang Nian was stunned. But now Anping Marquis was no longer the same; Jiang Nian did not have to cater to him anymore. Immediately, he lunged at Anping Marquis, "You hit me? You actually dared to hit me?"</p><p>Jiang Nian's strength was no match for Anping Marquis's. He scratched and clawed at his body, tearing through the skin with his nails and leaving numerous bloody marks. Jiang Nian even pulled out handfuls of Anping Marquis's hair.</p><p>Anping Marquis was enraged. Seeing how vicious Jiang Nian was, he could not tolerate it anymore. He raised his hand for another slap and then forcibly threw Jiang Nian to the ground!</p><p>With a "thud," Jiang Nian sat on the ground, his twisted ankle being harshly slammed once more. Jiang Nian's face contorted in pain; this time, he truly could not get back up.</p><p>Thus, these newly married spouses, who had just completed their ceremony, showed no affection towards each other but only chaos and disorder.</p><p>The jailer, wielding a long whip, was annoyed by their lingering and wasting his time. He whipped Anping Marquis, "Carry him up, hurry up! If you delay any longer, you'll regret it!"</p><p>The whip was extremely resilient, causing genuine pain with each strike, especially since Anping Marquis's injuries had not healed. Even biting through the pain, he could not help but let out a pained howl.</p><p>No matter how reluctant he was or how annoyed he was with Jiang Nian, he had to carry Jiang Nian.</p><p>The clinking of handcuffs echoed with each step Anping Marquis took, slow and heavy. Jiang Nian, on his back, slowly shed two tears.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Nian remembered something and turned around.</p><p>But at the city gate, there was no one, let alone Secretary Jiang coming to see him off.</p><p>In this lifetime, he might never see his father again.</p><p>Sadness filled Jiang Nian's heart.</p><p>Years of hard work had all amounted to nothing; reborn into another life, he did not even live as well as in his previous life!</p><p>Where was Secretary Jiang?</p><p>At this moment, Secretary Jiang was kneeling at the entrance of the Secretariat, sobbing loudly.</p><p>"Sir, your discerning eyes, I have no knowledge whatsoever of Secretary Jiang Nian's matter!"</p><p>"Sir, I have family both above and below me. Please——show mercy!"</p><p>Secretary Jiang kept bowing his head repeatedly, while his entire family knelt behind him in great fear. Soldiers were coming in and out of the mansion, packing valuable items into boxes and moving them out one by one.</p><p>Watching this, Secretary Jiang felt heartbreakingly helpless but had no means to stop it.</p><p>His good son, Jiang Nian, had secretly rebelled alongside Duke Pingan without a word, leading to his own exile to Youzhou. Now, their entire family was implicated and subjected to confiscation!</p><p>Years of savings would be emptied out in one day.</p><p>They were about to become the laughingstock of the entire capital city!</p><p>—He had two sons. He favored the younger one, but in the end, it was his unremarked-upon son who climbed high and became the Empress, exalted beyond compare, now completely ignoring him, this father!</p><p>Thinking of this, Secretary Jiang's sorrow deepened, as did his resentment towards Jiang Nian. He almost pounded his chest and stamped his feet, saying: "What a calamity! How could I have such a son!"</p><p>"Sir, I know nothing about it either, Sir——please show mercy!"</p><p>They were in despair, but Jiang Juan's mood was quite good.</p><p>With everything finally concluded and the ascension preparations completed, Jiang Juan no longer had to stay up late with Xue Fangli. He could now lie on his bed like a salted fish cake early.</p><p>However, his happiness did not last long.</p><p>While lying in Xue Fangli's arms, nearly asleep, he was suddenly woken up by someone pinching his chin and shaking him. Jiang Juan turned his head, not wanting to deal with anyone, so Xue Fangli directly lifted him up into a seated position.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jiang Juan lightly bumped into him, feeling extremely annoyed and mumbling her complaints, "Is sleeping a crime? Why? Why can't I sleep properly?"</p><p>Xue Fangli's tone was calm. "Try it."</p><p>With her eyes closed, Jiang Juan asked him, "Try what??"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn't respond. After waiting for a while, she realized he was genuinely lazy and had an insatiable curiosity, so she reluctantly opened her eyes.</p><p>In recent days, the Office of Clothing had been making dragon robes and phoenix robes. They sent over one of the phoenix robes at some point.</p><p>This newly embroidered phoenix robe used a just-right shade of crimson. A deeper hue would make it appear somber, while a lighter one would seem frivolous. The design was incredibly intricate, with the spreading phoenix in dazzling gold, embodying utmost luxury.</p><p>It looked beautiful, but Jiang Juan didn't want to move. She hugged Xue Fangli, leaning against him and lazily said, "I'm so tired."</p><p>He complained about being tired every day, yet she never saw him do anything. Gently squeezing the soft flesh on Jiang Juan's face, Xue Fangli glanced at her, "You really live up to your name."</p><p>"Jiang Luan."</p><p>He enunciated each word clearly as Jiang Juan spoke confidently, "What's wrong with being a bit lazy? I'm just lazy; I don't bully people like some others. I'm just a bad thing."</p><p>Though he didn't mention anyone by name, this 'bad thing' had been criticized. Not bullying people anymore would be unprofitable. Xue Fangli stared at him for a few seconds before reaching out and lifting Jiang Juan off the bed.</p><p>Suddenly suspended in mid-air, Jiang Juan quickly hugged him tightly, almost hanging on to Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli's voice was still calm. "What are you hugging??"</p><p>"A bad thing? What's there to hug?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>She could only explain, "I just happened to grab a hold."</p><p>Xue Fangli said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, "Then let go. I'm not like you; I'm just lazy. If you keep holding on, someone else might get bullied."</p><p>Not holding was fine; Jiang Juan let go of his hand.</p><p>But in the next second, the arm that had been around him seemed to want to pull away from Jiang Juan's waist. Jiang Juan jumped in fright, afraid he would be thrown down, and immediately wrapped himself back into the embrace.</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his gaze slightly, asked as if confused, "You hugged me again. Do you really like hugging me so much?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>What kind of nasty creature was this?</p><p>"Are you annoying."</p><p>After holding it in for a long time, Jiang Juan finally managed to utter these few words without much gusto.</p><p>Xue Fangli chuckled and carried Jiang Juan to the soft bed. Before putting him down, he asked with a hint of mockery, "Do you want me to carry you or do you want to sit on your own?"</p><p>Of course, Jiang Juan chose to be beautifully independent. He reached out for the armrest and tried to climb up, but suddenly a strong dizziness hit him, causing his movements to stop.</p><p>Fortunately, this bout of dizziness was brief, and he quickly recovered. However, that momentary discomfort made Jiang Juan instinctively clench his fists. Xue Fangli glanced at him and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Jiang Juan dismissed it casually, "Nothing."</p><p>Xue Fangli sized him up for a moment, saw that Jiang Juan seemed fine, and then took the phoenix robe, lifting his chin slightly, "Put it on."</p><p>Previously, Jiang Juan's bones had been so relaxed, but now that he was pulled up, he didn't try to play the reluctant card. He changed into the phoenix robe, held Xue Fangli up, and asked, "Do I look good?"</p><p>The robe was wide and a fiery red, dragging along the ground. Although Jiang Juan was naturally beautiful, this vibrant color accentuated his beauty even more, making him appear like a burning phoenix wearing this robe.</p><p>Having burned through his fiery youth, all that remained were his icy bones and delicate skin.</p><p>He watched him for a long time. Xue Fangli said in a calm tone, "Not good to look at." It was he who made Jiang Juan try on the phoenix robe and it was also he who did not praise her. Jiang Juan was quite unhappy and lunged towards him. Perhaps because her movements were too quick, she felt dizzy again and nearly lost her balance. Fortunately, Xue Fangli held her steady. Jiang Juan did not take it to heart and reached out to cover Xue Fangli's eyes, "If you think it’s not good, don't look anymore." Taking advantage of the situation, Xue Fangli embraced him, "What do you want to hear?" Forget others, Jiang Juan complained to him, "Even if it's not good-looking, you should still praise me." Xue Fangli: "Praise you." Jiang Juan shook his head, "No, you’re being insincere." Xue Fangli then slowly said two words, "Beautiful." Jiang Juan was still dissatisfied and felt like he would be driven to madness, "What’s wrong with you? Is praising me a crime?" "How else can it not be insincere?" Xue Fangli grabbed Jiang Juan's hand and carelessly replied, "You've been causing me trouble every day by going out—people want to draw your portrait, I haven't died yet but already someone is coveting you. If I praise you, perhaps in the future, you will not only be arrogant from favoritism but also from beauty. I can do nothing about it." Pausing for a moment, Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan again, "Want to know what I was thinking just now?" Jiang Juan blinked his eyes; he wanted to hear it, "Mm-hmm." Xue Fangli grabbed Jiang Juan's hand and kissed the tip of his finger, "This beauty, how can anyone else see you." "Also..." Suddenly using force, Xue Fangli pressed Jiang Juan down onto the soft bed. He lowered his eyes, his gaze deep with desire, "With this phoenix robe on, I want to take it off you myself."</p>
