						<p>Jiang Juan was combing his hair and putting on makeup as Miss Xiao Baita was standing there. You could use your powerful purchasing power to buy her out, Sch Fanli thought as he glanced at Jiang Juan and held his hand.</p><p>He really wasn’t afraid of him; he even dared to reach out.</p><p>And…</p><p>it felt quite soft.</p><p>The servant noticed the scene and let go of Jiang Juan, no longer supporting him. Jiang Juan took a step forward, but he hadn’t recovered from those few arrows yet—his legs were still weak—and with this movement, Jiang Juan stumbled forward.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>This was an embarrassing situation.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt like he would be humiliated in front of everyone as he fell like a dog eating shit. Suddenly, someone pulled him back, and he ended up colliding into Sch Fanli’s arms.</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned for a moment. Sch Fanli asked him, "Third Young Master, what happened?"</p><p>Weak legs, or scared stiff? Jiang Juan wanted to open his mouth but then thought it would be too embarrassing to tell the truth, so he decided not to speak honestly. On the spot, he came up with a lie: "... My heart hurts."</p><p>Sch Fanli lowered his head; Jiang Juan did look terrible. And at this moment, they were quite close together; he could smell the faint herbal scent on the young man’s body.</p><p>He didn’t mind this smell.</p><p>Sch Fanli said, "Then rest for a bit before we continue."</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled an “oh” and glanced at Sch Fanli, feeling even more puzzled.</p><p>Was King Li not quite approachable?</p><p>How did the descriptions in the book match up with reality?</p><p>Is the author redefining "disregarding human ethics" and "tyrannical and capricious"?</p><p>Jiang Juan thought about it over and over but still couldn't figure it out, so he decided to give up. At that moment, he also felt that he had rested enough and could move again. He took a few steps back and tugged at Xue Fangli's sleeve, "Your Highness, I'm ready."</p><p>As he stepped back, the fragrant scent lingering around Xue Fangli's nostrils gradually faded away, and Jiang Juan couldn't smell it anymore.</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned slightly but spoke in his usual tone, "Alright, let's go."</p><p>Jiang Juan took a few glances but didn't seem too bothered.</p><p>He was thinking about something else. According to the original storyline, Xue Fangli should be starting to have an episode, right?</p><p>Jiang Juan began to frequently glance at Xue Fangli.</p><p>Xue Fangli noticed and thoughtfully rubbed the small leaf purple sandalwood Buddha beads on his wrist without inquiring further.</p><p>As they entered the wedding hall, the matchmaker respectfully presented a red ribbon. Jiang Juan and Xue Fangli each held one end.</p><p>Just as Jiang Juan tightened his grip on the ribbon, he noticed something was amiss.</p><p>The man beside him seemed to have paused his movements.</p><p>His hand gripping the ribbon trembled uncontrollably, with veins protruding beneath pale skin. Xue Fangli's eyes were half-closed, his brows deeply furrowed, and the other hand pressed against his temple, appearing to be in extreme pain.</p><p>He was experiencing a severe headache and had an episode.</p><p>The high official reached into his robe, struggling due to trembling fingers before finally managing to take out a medicine bottle and shaky handedly poured out the medicine.</p><p>"Knock, knock, knock——"</p><p>In the midst of a deathly silence, the only sound was that of the bottle cap tapping against his palm. After several attempts to pour out the pills, Gao Guan Shi still couldn't manage it; his face turned pale as he realized something.</p><p>The medicine was gone.</p><p>His breath hitched.</p><p>"Y-Wangye..."</p><p>"Are you feeling a headache?"</p><p>Gao Guan Shi and Jiang Juan spoke simultaneously. Gao Guan Shi looked at him with a mixture of shock and anger—among all the guests in the hall, only this Third Young Master was still standing. Gao Guan Shi couldn't decide whether he should be seen as ignorant and fearless or brave.</p><p>Everyone in the capital knew that although Prince Li was gravely ill, he was unpredictable and cruel. Encountering him during one of his fits could mean death.</p><p>Jiang Juan caught Gao Guan Shi's gaze and was utterly perplexed. Of course, what baffled him even more was why everyone had fallen to their knees. However, this seemed less important at the moment.</p><p>After a brief hesitation, Jiang Juan asked Xue Fang Li, "Should I massage your head? It might help ease some of the pain."</p><p>Before undergoing heart surgery, Jiang Juan had actually rested in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital for some time. Given the low success rate of the surgery and his family's strong opposition to such risks, he spent his days idle in the ward, unable to even take long walks. He thus resorted to learning massage techniques from an old physician in the neighboring room.</p><p>Though he only mastered the basics, it should still alleviate some pain, as a way of thanking him for helping him up earlier.</p><p>Jiang Juan waited for a while but got no response from Xue Fang Li, assuming that he didn't trust him. He added, "I really can give you a massage."</p><p>Xue Fang Li finally opened his eyes, bloodshot almost to the point of redness. The pain was evident in his expression as he stared at Jiang Juan emotionlessly and said, "Okay."</p><p>Gao Guan Shi's forehead broke into cold sweat with a light thud; he sighed silently, looking at Jiang Juan as though he were already dead.</p><p>Sigh. I wonder if the noble people in the palace will blame me for the Third Young Master's absence.</p><p>Jiang Juan set aside the red silk and pressed Xue Fangli onto a chair, completely oblivious to the man's gaze that landed on his neck and the intensely malevolent look in his eyes.</p><p>Xue Fangli suddenly raised his hand, his fingertips touching Jiang Juan's skin.</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "What is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli ignored him, slightly curling his fingers, about to exert force when he caught a faint scent.</p><p>A subtle, almost imperceptible aroma of medicinal herbs.</p><p>The irritation and frustration caused by the headache seemed to be smoothed away by something. Sniffing this smell—this smell that he didn't dislike, even finding it rather pleasant—Xue Fangli's mood gradually returned to calmness.</p><p>Xue Fangli's fingers were very cold; Jiang Juan shivered slightly. He asked Xue Fangli again, "What is it?"</p><p>Xue Fangli looked into the youth's clear eyes and paused before speaking in a flat tone, "There's a red mole here."</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his head, the red mole right at the hollow of his neck. He couldn't see it but still felt a jolt.</p><p>How coincidental, he also had a red mole here.</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded vaguely. "Yeah, there is one."</p><p>Xue Fangli retracted his hand, and Jiang Juan stood up, moving behind him to start massaging.</p><p>The youth's strength was very light, and he located the acupoints accurately, but that was all he could do; he merely knew how to do it. Xue Fangli didn't stop him, closing his eyes lightly as he silently inhaled the youth's scent, his malevolent aura dispersing into nothingness.</p><p>The high official had been kneeling for a long time without hearing any screams. He cautiously lifted his head and was immediately stunned speechless.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Why didn't the Prince kill him?</p><p>That's not right.</p><p>Gao Jiangshi stood rooted to the spot, his gaze lingering too long. Xue Fangli looked at him with a sense of awareness, and Gao Jiangshi immediately shuddered before crawling on the ground, his heart pounding wildly.</p><p>Xue Fangli, looking tired, said, "Go fetch some medicine."</p><p>Gao Jiangshi hurriedly replied, "Yes!"</p><p>He stood up in cold sweat, turned around, and ran off as fast as he could.</p><p>Jiang Juan massaged Xue Fangli for a while before feeling tired and deciding to take it easy, attempting to substitute words for actions. "Prince, do you always get headaches?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli again, "Was my massage not bad?"</p><p>"...Fair enough."</p><p>Jiang Juan was satisfied.</p><p>Not long after, Gao Jiangshi returned. It seemed he didn't dare to linger for a moment; he left in cold sweat and returned drenched in anxiety. Xue Fangli took the medicine bottle.</p><p>The massage master seized the opportunity to run away. Jiang Juan lowered his head to look, his curiosity piqued. He remembered that the text hadn't explicitly mentioned Li Wang's illness, only stating it was incurable. So he asked, "Prince, what is your illness?"</p><p>His Adam's apple bobbed a few times as Xue Fangli swallowed the pill, and his gaze suddenly turned cold.</p><p>What illness? Insanity.</p><p>He looked at Jiang Juan indifferently.</p><p>As the third son of the Shushang Mansion, who was not favored, it was said that he grew up in the countryside from a young age and had a timid and shy personality. He did not agree with this assessment.</p><p>To kill him would be as easy as flipping one's hand.</p><p>However...</p><p>Xue Fangli recalled the eyes of the youth. There was an inexplicable joy and anticipation in them, clear as if they had not been tainted by a single grain of dust. He looked at Xue Fangli without fear or anxiety, simply gazing at him.</p><p>Killing him would be too much.</p><p>Expelling him would suffice.</p><p>With this thought, Xue Fangli slowly spoke: "Coughing up blood."</p><p>The medicine seemed to alleviate his pain, and Xue Fangli put on that layer of genteel demeanor again. However, there was a hint of detachment in his expression.</p><p>Coughing up blood...</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes widened.</p><p>Diseases causing coughing up blood seemed rather severe, no wonder the Xue Fangli in the books died on his wedding day.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed and then sincerely asked Xue Fangli: "Your Highness, are you feeling better? Can we continue with the ceremony?"</p><p>"It's not burdensome," Jiang Juan blinked his eyes. If being happy as a salted fish was considered a burden, he would be willing to bear it for a lifetime. Jiang Juan genuinely said, "Your Highness is noble and upright; considering me marrying into your family as climbing up high."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "Since we haven't gone through the ceremony yet, I'll send you away. What do you think?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "..."</p><p>He looked into Jiang Juan's eyes, seeing sincerity in the young man's black pupils. He tapped the medicine bottle lightly several times and after a long pause, Xue Fangli said, "Since that's the case, I'll ask you again in a few days."</p><p>As he spoke, he lowered his head and coughed softly; blood traces indeed seeped from between his fingers.</p><p>Jiang Juan saw this and sighed continuously.</p><p>Alas, it didn't take long before you disappeared in Chapter 3 of the novel.</p><p>A servant brought Xue Fangli a golden basin, and he washed his hands slowly. In the rippling water, Xue Fangli inexplicably recalled what Jiang Juan had said.</p><p>So weakened that even taking a few steps caused chest pain, how much longer could he last?</p><p>He sneered silently, his voice surprisingly gentle.</p><p>"Then let us continue with the ceremony."</p><p>The matchmaker, realizing she had just circled around Hell's Gate, wiped the cold sweat from her forehead hastily and broke into a broad smile. She raised her voice and shouted, "First bow to heaven and earth!"</p><p>"Second bow to your parents!"</p><p>"Bow to each other as husband and wife!"</p><p>"Enter the bridal chamber——!"</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Juan suddenly remembered something.</p><p>What was the plot for the part where they bowed to each other?</p><p>—"Duke Ling is a man of unfathomable depth; he is terrifying and even more so, alarming. Jiang Nian recalls that she had been bowing her head ever since getting off the sedan chair, not daring to peek at anything. The entire journey was filled with anxiety and fear. What made it even more terrifying was that he fell ill halfway through. Jiang Nian witnessed Duke Ling killing many of his servants, blood flowing like a river."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "? ? ?"</p><p>He looked at Xue Fangli, who was as gentle as jade before him, then at the unharmed servants, and once again fell deeply into confusion.</p><p>He picked it up, shook off the dust, and even lowered his head to sniff. Jiang Juan's sense of smell wasn't very sensitive; he could only detect a medicinal scent, not much different from other Chinese herbs.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously, "If it doesn’t smell like this, then what does it smell like?"</p><p>Xue Fangli didn’t immediately answer. After a long moment, he slowly said, "Come over."</p><p>He would come over if he wanted to; Jiang Juan moved closer.</p><p>In fact, he wasn't just insensitive to scents but also had an unusually dull perception of atmosphere. For instance, right now, the high official was already grieving for him silently, but Jiang Juan approached without any precautions.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him a few times and then placed his hand on his right shoulder. Beneath the wide sleeves, there was a pale and slender wrist. Xue Fangli exerted a little force, causing him to bend down.</p><p>His gaze landed on the youth's neck.</p><p>A long, white, and beautiful section. A few strands of black hair hung loosely, touching the youth’s neck at one point, where a red mole was extremely prominent and sensuous.</p><p>At the same time, as he got closer, the youth's scent became more distinct.</p><p>—a medicinal fragrance that was hard to identify. Perhaps it was from some rare herb or a mixture of several herbs. In any case, it wasn't chaotic; all elements blended perfectly, with a light and gentle aroma.</p><p>The madness and brutality deep in Xue Fangli's soul were calmed by this scent, even his extremely unstable emotions found temporary peace.</p><p>"Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan did not know what to do and raised her head blankly.</p><p>Slanted beams of light crept through the gaps in the bamboo curtains, falling precisely on his fair face. The jade beads of the curtain swayed continuously; it was unclear whether he or the beads were more translucent. The young man’s eyelashes flickered gently, soft and pure, like a small bodhisattva seated upon a lotus.</p><p>He was right here, within reach, yet seemed as elusive as clouds and mist, always dispersing into nothingness, leaving no trace.</p>
