						<p>No matter how worried he was, Jiang Juan still walked in.</p><p>"Wangfei."</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan, Manager Wang managed to force a smile. He was drenched in sweat and clearly couldn't hold his own against Jiang Qingliang, who was wiping his forehead incessantly with a handkerchief.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang turned his head to look at Jiang Juan, said nothing, and Jiang Juan politely greeted him, "Long time no see."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang curiously asked, "Long? It's only been one day, right?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was silent for a few seconds before nodding her head sincerely. She said, "What you said."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>What was going on? That familiar feeling of being cut off again.</p><p>Ever since the medicinal dishes were brought to the table, Jiang Qingliang had been talking non-stop, and Manager Wang now felt dizzy every time he heard his voice. Taking advantage of this momentary silence, Manager Wang hurriedly invited Jiang Juan, "Wangfei, all these dishes are tonic medicinal foods. Perhaps they can help your heart condition. May I ask you to taste them?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang opened his mouth, unsure which word had triggered his inner nitpicker. "You just said—"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "What you said."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang stubbornly finished his sentence, "—tonic medicinal foods can only strengthen the body."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He stared at Jiang Juan, "Don't you know social etiquette? Why didn't you let others finish speaking?"</p><p>Being reprimanded by a nitpicker for not knowing social etiquette was quite amusing. Jiang Juan was speechless as she looked at him. Thousands of words were reduced to just four: "What you said."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "."</p><p>Before encountering Jiang Juan, his life had never been marked by silence; he was always the one who could shut others up. Being left speechless was an experience he had never had before, and Jiang Juan managed to achieve this with just four words.</p><p>—"What you said…"</p><p>Damn it, did he not want a face?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang felt depressed, but no matter how upset he got, he could only vent his frustration uselessly. He asked Jiang Juan, "Can't you say anything else? If you don’t know about social etiquette, can’t you at least argue back? Why do you just let them insult you?"</p><p>His tone was quite harsh. Manager Wang enjoyed seeing Jiang Qingliang squirm but was afraid they might start a real argument, so he hurriedly ladled some chicken soup and said with a smile, "Quick, try this; the emperor has praised it repeatedly."</p><p>In fact, Manager Wang’s worry was unnecessary. Jiang Juan was too lazy to argue with someone who just liked to provoke others. It was too tiring; if something could be resolved with four words, he didn’t want to talk about it for hours. Jiang Juan picked up a spoon and tasted a mouthful of the chicken soup.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>This mouthful was a mixture of flavors—truly a medley of tastes—the original taste of the chicken broth had strangely fused with that of well-cooked Chinese medicine, giving rise to all five flavors: sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty.</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn’t prepared for this; he hadn’t expected Emperor Hongxing to poison him with dark cuisine. Tears welled up involuntarily in his eyes.</p><p>"Hey, you…"</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him. Jiang Qingliang felt even more uncomfortable and couldn’t help recalling what he had said, wondering if he had been too harsh.</p><p>As these thoughts crossed his mind, Jiang Qingliang couldn’t resist calling out to him again. When Jiang Juan looked over, his eyelashes were wet with tears, his eyes glistening.</p><p>What the heck.</p><p>Why did he cry?</p><p>It was just two sentences; so what?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was speechless. He was quite afraid of people crying, especially when they were as beautiful as a little beauty—no matter how much he tried to deny it, Jiang Juan fit his aesthetic point perfectly, like an angel; with those tears, he felt that he had committed a great sin.</p><p>Before meeting Jiang Juan, his life had never known silence; he was always the one who could shut others up. Being left speechless was something he had never experienced before, and Jiang Juan managed to achieve this with just four words.</p><p>—"What you said…"</p><p>Damn it, didn’t he want a face?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang felt depressed, but no matter how upset he got, he could only vent his frustration uselessly.

He had always been the one to silence others, rendering them speechless. But being left without a word was a new experience for him—one achieved with just four words from Jiang Juan.</p><p>—"What you said…"</p><p>Damnit, couldn’t he at least maintain some semblance of his dignity?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang felt deeply depressed but could only vent his frustration in useless outbursts. He turned to Jiang Juan and asked, "Can’t you say anything else? If you don’t understand social etiquette, can’t you at least argue back? Why do you just let them insult you?"</p><p>His tone was sharp with exasperation. Manager Wang found it entertaining to watch Jiang Qingliang squirm but feared they might escalate into a real argument. He quickly ladled some chicken soup and said with a smile, "Quick, try this; the emperor has praised it repeatedly."</p><p>In reality, Manager Wang’s worry was misplaced. Jiang Juan had no interest in engaging with someone who enjoyed provoking others. It was too much effort—four words could resolve most issues. Jiang Juan picked up a spoon and tasted a mouthful of the chicken soup.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…"</p><p>This single taste was an explosion of flavors—a perfect blend where the original chicken broth had unexpectedly fused with well-cooked Chinese medicine, creating a harmonious mix of sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty.</p><p>Jiang Juan hadn’t expected this; he certainly didn’t anticipate that Emperor Hongxing would resort to dark cuisine. Tears welled up involuntarily in his eyes.</p><p>"Hey, you…"</p><p>Jiang Juan ignored him, lost in his thoughts. Jiang Qingliang felt increasingly uncomfortable, replaying the words that had slipped out. He wondered if he had been too harsh.</p><p>These thoughts plagued him as he spoke once more, trying to reach through Jiang Juan’s silence. When Jiang Juan finally looked up, his eyelashes were damp with tears, his eyes shimmering with unshed emotions.</p><p>What in the world?</p><p>Why was he crying?</p><p>It was just two sentences; so what?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang stood there speechless, his heart heavy with regret and fear. He was afraid of seeing people cry, especially someone as beautiful as Jiang Juan—no matter how much he tried to deny it, she fit his aesthetic ideals perfectly, like an angel. Her tears seemed to accuse him of some grave sin.</p><p>"You, don't cry," Jiang Qingliang said as he lifted someone's barb—his skills at consoling people were lacking. He dryly said, "I was just joking around. Why are you crying?"</p><p>"——"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was flustered and said, "I'm sorry. It was rude of me to say that. I shouldn't have teased you. I won't tease you anymore... "</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>Did he misunderstand something?</p><p>Jiang Juan pondered for a few seconds. What malicious intentions could a dead fish possibly have? He glanced at Jiang Qingliang and slowly asked, "Really?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said, "If it's not true, then what is—"</p><p>Before he could finish, Jiang Qingliang remembered his words about not teasing him and paused, then corrected himself, "Of course, it's as real as pearls."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh" and picked up another bowl of chicken soup. "I forgive you. Here's to our friendship."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang didn't understand what he meant but guessed that he wanted him to drink the soup, so he tasted a sip.</p><p>Eww!</p><p>Jiang Qingliang turned pale. "What is this stuff? Why does it taste like this? Did someone poison it?"</p><p>Jiang Juan sympathetically said, "Yeah, it tastes awful."</p><p>Guan Zongguan hurriedly explained, "You shouldn't say that. A good medicine tastes bitter but is good for the sick. This medicinal soup follows the same principle. Chicken soup is nutritious, and when combined with herbs, it's even more beneficial."</p><p>Jiang Juan understood the reasoning, but he still couldn't help saying, "But it really tastes strange."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang gulped down a large half-bowl of ice sugar pear juice and finally suppressed that taste. He realized something after a while and asked Jiang Juan with a blank face, "So you—didn't cry just now because I teased you, but because the chicken soup tasted too bad?"</p><p>Jiang Juan, innocent-looking, looked at him, "Or what? No one would cry like that, right?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "............"</p><p>This made her so angry.</p><p>He gradually became shark-hearted.</p><p>No, being a shark was against the law, and besides, he had just been punished by the Prince and forced to spend the night soaking in water.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang silently picked up the bowl and began to slurp on the iced sugar snow pear soup again.</p><p>Gang Zongguan almost burst out laughing but managed to hold it back. He then continued serving dishes, "Sir, why don't you try this roasted pigeon?"</p><p>The entire table was filled with medicinal cuisine. Even the chicken broth could be cooked into such a flavor; one could only imagine what the others were like. As victims of the chicken broth, Jiang Juan and Jiang Qingliang exchanged horrified glances.</p><p>"Madame, since you are weak, I will take some deer antler for you..."</p><p>"Mister Jiang, please eat this nourishing congee, which has heat-clearing and fire-resolving effects."</p><p>Despair, Jiang Juan really felt despair.</p><p>However, the feast was a gift from Emperor Hongxing. She could not refuse to eat it, so Jiang Qingliang, with a pained expression, picked up her chopsticks. Jiang Juan had no choice but to muster her courage and put another mouthful in her mouth.</p><p>No, even if she starved to death or jumped down from here, she would never take another bite.</p><p>Only now did Jiang Juan understand why the Prince said he could not eat the food here. After a few seconds of thought, Jiang Juan decided to leave.</p><p>In the next second, the silver chopsticks in his hand fell with a "clack." Jiang Juan clutched her chest and winced in pain, frowning.</p><p>Governor Wang was startled, "Princess Consort, what's the matter with you?"</p><p>Jiang Juan had a pale face and shook his head, "My chest hurts a bit... "</p><p>He didn't finish speaking, as if he couldn't breathe from the pain. Governor Wang hurriedly supported him, patting his back to help him take a breath.</p><p>After a while, Jiang Juan said again, "I feel stuffy, can't breathe."</p><p>Governor Wang was terrified, "Then quickly go outside for some fresh air."</p><p>Governor Wang carefully helped him up, and although Jiang Juan's steps were somewhat wobbly, he winked at Jiang Qingliang as they passed by.</p><p>——Hurry up and run away.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "?"</p><p>He froze for a moment before bursting into laughter. He reached into his sleeve, secretly giving Jiang Juan a thumbs-up and quickly followed him out to blend in.</p><p>This Jiang Juan wasn't bad; he was quite clever and had some loyalty.</p><p>Not wanting to eat, he pretended to have an illness, not only escaping himself but also reminding him to run away quickly.</p><p>However—</p><p>Such a clever person, could it really be that he pushed Niege into the lake?</p><p>Last time, he was already suspicious of Jiang Juan's constant nagging, which was quite annoying. Moreover, he had an illness anyway; he could have easily taken advantage of Niege secretly without needing to act so stupid.</p><p>Thinking about it, Jiang Qingliang felt there was only one possibility.</p><p>——There must be some misunderstanding between Jiang Juan and his brother Niege.</p><p>In Jiang Juan's case, he unintentionally cleansed himself in front of Jiang Qingliang. He feigned illness for a while, planning to resume his normal state afterward, but before he could recover, Xue Fangli had arrived.</p><p>Jiang Juan was being supported by Manager Wang when Xue Fangli arrived and immediately picked him up.</p><p>"Your Highness, you've finally come!"</p><p>Although Jiang Juan claimed that his heart disease wasn't serious and that he just needed to rest, Manager Wang couldn't help but be worried. Not only did he secretly send people to invite the imperial physician, he also hurried to notify the Prince in the Palace of Tranquility.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He still didn't want to deal with the Prince.</p><p>"Why are you hurting again?"</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes. Jiang Juan's skin was almost translucent white, and with his listless expression, he looked so fragile that one touch could shatter him.</p><p>Jiang Juan shook his head, indicating that he was fine, then lowered his head, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>It was as silent as in the Palace of Tranquility.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at Jiang Juan a few times before reluctantly closing his eyes. Since Jiang Juan didn't speak up, Xue Fangli asked Manager Wang with a stern expression, "What happened to him?"</p><p>Manager Wang sighed, "Just after he finished having dinner, Princess Consort suddenly said her chest hurt and she couldn't breathe."</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Manager Wang hesitated and said, "However, before that, Princess Consort had been arguing with Mr. Jiang Qingliang. Princess Consort has heart disease and can't stand the stress. This slave tried to stop her once, but seeing that she was just joking around with Mr. Jiang Qingliang, I didn't intervene again... I wonder if it had anything to do with that..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "???"</p><p>How dark is this eunuch's heart?</p><p>Afraid of being blamed, he took the entire blame on himself.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang stiffened as he passed by, inwardly muttering "Oh no." He softened his footsteps and was about to take off running when Xue Fangli’s head rose slightly without lifting his eyes from the ground: "Stop."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>He hated it.</p><p>"W-Wang Yu."</p><p>Reluctantly, Jiang Qingliang stopped in his tracks and bowed politely. Xue Fangli lifted an eyelid, looking at Jiang Qingliang without any expression on his face.</p><p>The person in his arms was very light, almost weightless. Xue Fangli held Jiang Juan so gently that he didn’t dare to use too much force, afraid of breaking him. However, after hearing Manager Wang’s words, he could barely suppress his anger.</p><p>He wouldn’t answer him, but would play around with others?</p><p>Didn’t he say he trusted him? What kind of mood was he in now?</p><p>Xue Fangli asked Jiang Qingliang indifferently: "Did you find Wang’s small leaf zitan bracelet in the lake?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang gritted his teeth and replied, "No."</p><p>He wasn’t stupid. The Wang Yu hadn’t attended the Yumei Fairy’s ceremony, so how could he have dropped the bracelet in the lake? Making him look for it was purely to torment him.</p><p>Xue Fangli nodded slightly and said absentmindedly, "Wang remembered, maybe the bracelet is in Weiyang Lake inside the palace. Since you’re quite good with water, go find it for Wang again."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "? ? ?"</p><p>What did he do wrong?</p><p>Just because his name was Jiang Qingliang, did that mean he had to stay in the water all the time?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang felt devastated. Xue Fangli was the Wang Yu; since he was noble and said it was so, Jiang Qingliang could only suffer and say, "Yes, Wang Yu."</p><p>The sleeve of his robe was suddenly tugged a few times, the movement coming from the person in his arms. Xue Fangli lowered his head while Jiang Juan tilted hers and said softly, “It has nothing to do with him.”</p><p>“Even if it were truly his heart condition causing this outburst, it’s not because of him.”</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was quite moved by these words and looked at him.</p><p>A good brother, saving him from the fire.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang knew that Jiang Juan’s outburst was just an act, but he couldn’t bring himself to say so. Now that Jiang Juan had taken the initiative to clear things up for him, Jiang Qingliang felt a weight lifted off his shoulders.</p><p>As he continued to feel touched, Jiang Qingliang met Xue Fangli’s cold gaze, which made half of his back go cold and his heart nearly stop beating.</p><p>Darn it, why is he so angry?</p><p>It was just because he glanced at his concubine twice.</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>His Wang Ye (imperial prince) uncle seemed quite concerned about his concubine, but Jiang Juan had just been speaking up for him.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: “…”</p><p>No way, no way, this isn’t something to be unhappy about?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang froze in place, thinking for a few seconds. His strong survival instinct made him decide to take a dip in the water to cool off. He forced a smile and said, “It’s pretty hot. Why don’t we go into the water? Your Highness, you must be looking for your bracelet.”</p><p>This time, when Jiang Qingliang tried to leave, Xue Fangli didn’t stop him. He slowly lowered his eyelids and met Jiang Juan’s gaze. After a long while, he spoke in a cold voice.</p><p>“It’s not because of him, is it because of the Wang?”</p><p>Xue Fangli asked him, “What are you upset about?”</p><p>"Was it King ❀ who turned the person into a man-zhi and threw them in a pigsty, or was it King ❀ who brutally peeled the hunter's skin off alive? Can't you bear to hear this?"</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly frowned, Xue Fangli stroked his face with an indifferent expression. "Huh? Why aren't you speaking?"</p><p>He paused for a moment and laughed carelessly. "How could King ❀ forget that Queen ❀ has a compassionate heart? Surely she can't bear either of these things, can she?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback. "……"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly. He didn't think Jiang Juan's words would be something he wanted to hear. Xue Fangli asked Jiang Juan again, "Didn't you say you believe ❀ King?"</p><p>"That's what you call believing?"</p><p>He had a boundless fury and endless resentment, but no place to vent them—holding in his arms was a jade beauty who was sickly weak; he couldn't exert any force or even get angry.</p><p>His emotions were surging, the madness inside him raging, Xue Fangli forcibly suppressed it and finally said calmly, "Forget it."</p><p>Whether ❀ Xing believed or didn't believe was unimportant.</p><p>As long as he didn't get angry, as long as he was fine.</p><p>Xue Fangli half-closed his eyelids and slowly spoke, "You have a heart condition, so you can't be angry, there's no need to be angry over ❀ someone. That woodcutter wanted to stab—"</p><p>His voice trailed off, and a hand covered his lips; it was Jiang Juan stopping Xue Fangli from continuing.</p><p>Jiang Juan belatedly realized he was getting angry while the Prince had misunderstood something, so he could only explain, "I don't believe ❀ his nonsense; even he himself says he heard it secondhand."</p><p>"Prince, do you really not know what you're angry about?"</p><p>Jiang Juan lowered his lashes and softly said, "Why should you let others talk about things the Prince hasn't done? No matter what happened in the bookstore, it can't be blamed on the Prince. But why don't you say anything, why don't you explain?"</p><p>The Prince was a victim, Jiang Juan knew he shouldn't get angry at the Prince, but he really couldn't help it.</p><p>Jiang Juan raised his eyes, his pupils bright and clear. He said earnestly, "Your Highness, I do not want you to be misunderstood."</p>
