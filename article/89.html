						<p>This day, Yang Liu painted for a long time.</p><p>In the end, he was an artist, so he painted freely and contentedly. As for what to do after finishing the painting, Yang Liu was only allowed to paint a portrait of Jiang Juan, and the decision on where the painting would go was not in his hands. That evening, Yang Liu drank two catties of white wine miserably and cried to his friend all night long. His friend could not hold back his sobbing, and he wept until his face turned pale.</p><p>After this day, Jiang Juan's life gradually became more regulated.</p><p>During this period, Gu Xiang specially visited and met Jiang Juan. He praised Xie Bailu's talent in flood control and some inventions endlessly.</p><p>Since it concerned a matter of life and death, Jiang Juan rarely took the initiative to speak: "Is he unwilling to go south? Should I ask the Prince to invite him?"</p><p>Gu Xiang shook his head hurriedly upon hearing this: "It's unnecessary."</p><p>He smiled and said, "As soon as he heard that it was recommended by the princess consort, he immediately agreed, eager to leave for flood control tomorrow. He said that the princess consort needed him; not only would he be willing to manage floods, but even climb mountains and cross rivers."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Compared to the main character's suffering and Anping Marquis, they were too lucky.</p><p>In short, during this period, apart from not sleeping and having no time for himself, Jiang Juan almost had everything go smoothly,</p><p>but a turning point soon arrived.</p><p>One afternoon, Jiang Juan fell asleep and rolled over, but nobody embraced him. He opened his eyes drowsily to find the bed empty; the Prince was gone.</p><p>"Where's the Prince?"</p><p>Jiang Juan asked curiously as Lan Ting, who was guarding outside, lifted the canopy and smiled, saying, "It seems there is something, and the Prince went to handle it."</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered "Oh" and was about to turn over to sleep when he suddenly noticed something. He sat up abruptly, "Lanting, I... seem to be able to see a little..."</p><p>Lanting: "What's the matter?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "I... seem to be able to see a little."</p><p>The reason why it's said 'a little' is that Jiang Juan's eyes had not fully recovered and he could barely make out objects, but this was enough.</p><p>At first, Doctor Sun said there was no need to worry, as Jiang Juan's vision would recover soon. However, day after day passed with no signs of improvement. Lanting was naturally very worried, but now she finally breathed a sigh of relief, "Thank goodness."</p><p>Jiang Juan didn't react too strongly.</p><p>Rarely had the Prince been around, so he hadn't been bothered anymore. He could sleep as long as he wanted. Jiang Juan lay down again, just wanting to sleep soundly.</p><p>Unfortunately, misfortune struck quickly. Before Jiang Juan could fall asleep, someone ran over urgently with a pale face, crying and saying, "Princess Consort, Princess Consort, the cat is missing."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Jiang Juan had quite liked that cat. Lanting hurriedly asked about it, and it turned out that this four-eared cat couldn't be confined very well and often sneaked out to roam around the entire palace grounds. In the past, when mealtime came, the cat would return by itself, so the maids hadn't paid much attention.</p><p>But this time, since last night, the cat had not returned home. The maids had looked for it several times today and searched everywhere, but they couldn't find it. Everyone in the palace was now panicking.</p><p>Lanting asked her, "Did you check the places where the cat often went to play?"</p><p>The maid replied, "I did look, but I didn't find it. I practically searched the entire palace grounds, except for the Stand Snow Hall... I dare not go inside. The cat wasn't in any other place."</p><p>After hearing this, Jiang Juan asked curiously, "Why can't you go into the Stand Snow Hall?"</p><p>Stand Snow Hall...</p><p>The maidservant's fingers trembled slightly at the sides. The Princess Consort might not know these things, but they were all too aware that when His Highness was still a prince, if someone had offended him but he did not wish for them to die, he would send them to the Snow Hall for torment, making them beg for death without relief.</p><p>The Snow Hall was essentially a torture chamber.</p><p>It sounded rather mysterious. Jiang Juan thought it was just like a study where entering was not forbidden, so he should be able to. Jiang Juan said, "Well, I know that. You go look for somewhere else, and I'll take a look myself."</p><p>"Sir..."</p><p>Lanting held her hands tightly, with an instinctive feeling of discomfort. "Your eyes have just recovered, why don't you rest? Or perhaps I can ask the steward to help look?"</p><p>Jiang Juan also wanted to sleep, but he was not quite at ease after losing his cat. He still decided to go look for it himself. "It's okay."</p><p>Lanting hesitated, "Sir..."</p><p>The maidservant's unnatural expression did not escape Lanting's notice. She vaguely felt that the Snow Hall was not a place they should go, let alone their master.</p><p>Jiang Juan had made up his mind and would not listen to her objections. "Lanting, are you going?"</p><p>"Servant..."</p><p>Lanting was still trying to persuade him when Jiang Juan waited for a moment, realizing that Lanting did not want to go, so he left on his own. Seeing this, although Lanting felt increasingly uneasy, she still chased after him. "Sir, be careful. I'll support you."</p><p>The Snow Hall was not far.</p><p>The guards stood outside. When they saw Jiang Juan, they hesitated slightly but still allowed him to enter without blocking him.</p><p>Thus, Jiang Juan entered the Snow Hall unobstructed. While he looked around, he did not forget to ask Lanting, "Lanting, I can't see very clearly, help me take a look."</p><p>That's right, Tuanzi. Besides Xue Gou, Jiang Juan seriously gave his cat a nickname, and the name would depend on the situation.</p><p>The maidservant's fingers trembled slightly at the sides. The Princess Consort might not know these things, but they were all too aware that when His Highness was still a prince, if someone had offended him but he did not wish for them to die, he would send them to the Snow Hall for torment, making them beg for death without relief.</p><p>The Snow Hall was essentially a torture chamber.</p><p>The maidservant dared not tell Jiang Juan the truth and only vaguely said, "Without His Highness's permission, no one dares to enter."</p><p>It sounded rather mysterious. Jiang Juan thought it was just like a study where entering was not forbidden, so he should be able to. Jiang Juan said, "Well, I know that. You go look for somewhere else, and I'll take a look myself."</p><p>"Sir..."</p><p>Lanting held her hands tightly, with an instinctive feeling of discomfort.

The Princess Consort might not be aware of these things, but they were all too well-informed that when His Highness was still a prince, if someone had offended him but he did not wish for them to die, he would send them to the Snow Hall for torment, making them beg for death without respite.</p><p>The Snow Hall was essentially a torture chamber.</p><p>The maidservant dared not reveal the truth to Jiang Juan and only vaguely said, "Without His Highness's permission, no one dares to enter."</p><p>It sounded rather mysterious.

While he looked around, he did not forget to ask Lanting, "Lanting, I can't see very clearly, help me take a look."</p><p>Indeed, Tuanzi. Besides Xue Gou, Jiang Juan seriously gave his cat a nickname, and the name would depend on the situation.</p><p>—The Prince irritated him, the cat was called Xue gou. When he wanted to curse, he would call it Tuanzi without any reason.</p><p>Lanting responded, "Yes, Young Master."</p><p>They walked and stopped along the way, soon reaching the main hall. There were many guards standing outside the door. Jiang Juan did not pay much attention to them or intend to go in. However, as he passed by, he faintly heard a very subtle cat's meow and a familiar voice.</p><p>The Prince and the cat?</p><p>Jiang Juan turned around. The door was closed, and he could not see what was happening inside. He asked the guards for confirmation, "Is the Prince here?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Jiang Juan said, "Oh," raised his hand to knock on the door.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside Liexuetang, Xue Fali was holding a man's collar tightly, forcing him to lift his head.</p><p>"Do you want to die?"</p><p>Xue Fali's voice remained calm, "Has this Wang ordered you to die?"</p><p>The high official stood beside him, holding a cat. He glanced at it and thought that Li Shilang had rather delusional ideas. Having the Princess Dowager maimed like this was one thing, but he wanted to commit suicide and end his life once and for all.</p><p>How could His Highness afford to let him off?</p><p>This death he sought today might have angered His Highness.</p><p>The high official shook his head. As expected, just as he thought about it, Xue Fali spoke lazily, "Li Da, this Wang said he would cut you into pieces a thousand times over. You are still far from that. Why do you seek death?"</p><p>"Thanks to you, this Wang's Princess Dowager has not yet recovered her eye injury. How can you die."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled bitterly, his tone filled with regret. "I wanted to leave your eyes so that you ?? could see how ???? was brutally tortured, but now His Majesty has changed his mind—come, gouge out his eyes and stuff them into his mouth, make him swallow them!"</p><p>The guards moved forward at the command. Just then, a knock sounded on the door.</p><p>"Bang bang bang."</p><p>Lixue Hall rarely saw visitors unless there was something urgent. The chief steward looked at Xue Fangli; seeing him nod, he stepped over the pool of blood and rushed to the door.</p><p>"How…"</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the chief steward froze in place.</p><p>The Crown Princess? Why is it the Crown Princess?</p><p>Jiang Juan was also stunned.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, with bamboo curtains pulled down completely, blocking out the afternoon sunlight. The thick smell of blood filled the air. In a corner, a man was held down by the guards; his body was covered in blood stains, and one of his legs dragged on the ground, as if parts of flesh had been ?? cut off, revealing bleached white bones.</p><p>His eyelids lifted, and the next moment, Xue Fangli also paused in his movements.</p><p>"…Tuanzi is missing."</p><p>Seeing this bloody scene again made Jiang Juan a little scared. He was usually slow to react and rarely had any sense of danger, but at that moment, he became sharp-witted; his intuition told him not to let the Prince know that ???? could be seen.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked, "I heard a cat's meow when I passed by earlier, is Tuanzi here??"</p><p>It was indeed here, nestled in the chief steward’s arms. At that instant, the chief steward had truly been soaked with cold sweat. Hearing Jiang Juan ask this question made him realize that Jiang Juan could not see.</p><p>Still… still…</p><p>The prince had only recently been concerned about the crown princess discovering his secret not long ago.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>High Emissary lifted a hand, stuffed the cat into Jiang Juan's arms. Jiang Juan pet it and said, "Why are you running around everywhere?"</p><p>The little cat meowed incessantly and twisted to chase Jiang Juan’s fingers. Jiang Juan added, "...Is the prince also here? I think I heard his voice too."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Xue Fangli responded with a nod. Jiang Juan couldn't help hugging the cat tighter and asked him, "Prince, what's wrong? You forced me to accompany you during the day and even made me take a nap with you in the afternoon, but then you secretly ran away."</p><p>Xue Fangli stared at Jiang Juan for a long time before slowly saying, "Come here."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't going to comply. He spoke slowly, "I can’t come over. I don’t want Lanting to help me up; she almost tripped me several times. You better come and carry me."</p><p>After pausing, Jiang Juan continued, "What’s this smell? It's awful."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at High Emissary, who hurriedly opened the window for ventilation. Xue Fangli then said, "I tried some incense."</p><p>Jiang Juan responded with an “oh,” and Xue Fangli walked towards him, wrapping his arms around Jiang Juan’s waist and lifting him up.</p><p>"Can't you see? Running around like this?"</p><p>"Lanting couldn’t enter Lixuetang, so I said I would bring her in."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled carelessly. "She couldn't come in, but you could?"</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded, making a great effort to remain calm. "Otherwise, what else? I am the crown princess; are there any places I can’t go?"</p><p>Xue Fangli remained silent. Jiang Juan dared not look around and had intended to bury his face in Xue Fangli’s chest, but the smell of blood was too overwhelming, so he gave up. However, Jiang Juan suddenly remembered that evening when the prince returned with a similar scent.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>He paused, and Xue Fanglei caught him.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan shook her head slightly. Xue Fanglei sat down, and Jiang Juan perched on his lap, holding a little cat in her arms. She lowered her head, pretending to play with the cat, but her heart was pounding uncontrollably.</p><p>He had heard from Gao Guan Shi that the Prince was interrogating Li Shilang.</p><p>How did Li Shilang's legs end up like this?</p><p>Xue Fanglei didn't stop them. The guards exchanged glances and carried out orders to gouge out Li Shilang's eyes.</p><p>The blade pierced through, causing excruciating pain. Just as Li Shilang was about to scream, he was tightly covered his mouth by someone, and Jiang Juan still managed to hear a little bit. She asked, "Prince, what sound?"</p><p>She hesitated for a moment but then turned her head away. Not looking might have been fine, but upon seeing, Jiang Juan nearly fainted.</p><p>The next second, her chin was grabbed by a finger, turning her face back. Xue Fanglei calmly asked, "Want to eat some grapes?"</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Jiang Juan was slightly confused. When she didn't speak, Xue Fanglei took it as consent and fed her a grape.</p><p>At that moment, Li Shilang's eyes were gouged out, leaving only bloody hollows. On the other side, Xue Fanglei peeled the grape, letting the purplish-red juice drip from his pale fingers to Jiang Juan's lips.</p><p>Held in an embrace, Jiang Juan had to twist her head to see, but Xue Fanglei was directly facing Li Shilang's direction. However, he remained expressionless throughout.</p><p>Wasn't the Prince interrogating Li Shilang?</p><p>What were they doing?</p><p>Why didn't the Prince stop him?</p><p>"Eat."</p><p>Xue Fangli let out a single syllable, and Jiang Juan's eyelashes fluttered in fear. He opened his mouth to bite into the grape, but his jaw trembled lightly.</p><p>In fact, it wasn't just his jaw.</p><p>"Are you trembling?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said blankly, "Huh? Did I? Maybe the grape is too sour."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered his eyes and said, "Is that so. Give this prince a taste."</p><p>As soon as he spoke, he leaned in and kissed Jiang Juan.</p><p>But Jiang Juan was still reeling from the shock.</p><p>He suddenly remembered a detail.</p><p>That night, when the Prince returned, it was clearly after bathing, yet there was still a heavy stench of blood on him. One could imagine how bloody the scene had been.</p><p>What exactly was the Prince doing?</p><p>Wasn't the Prince supposed to be very... careful?</p><p>The Secretary's legs, the Secretary's eyes...</p><p>Without the Prince's order, how would the guards dare to act against the Secretary?</p><p>The Prince, the Prince—</p><p>"Miao."</p><p>"Prince..."</p><p>Jiang Juan turned his head, feeling very confused. He wanted to escape this kiss, but then he saw Li Shilang being forced to swallow his own eye, and Jiang Juan froze on the spot.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him a few times and said calmly, "I understand."</p><p>Jiang Juan asked him again, "What about you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli replied indifferently, "This Prince still has matters to attend to."</p><p>Lan Ting walked over with a pale face, "Yes, Young Master."</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jiang Juan acted as if nothing had happened and kept walking forward. However, Xue Fangli suddenly intervened again.</p><p>"Go slowly, the cat knocked over the tea cup, there's still some water ahead."</p><p>"No, just that one splash... of water."</p><p>"Did you see it?"</p><p>The crimson lips parted, and Xue Fangli slowly approached Jiang Juan. He wrapped his arms around Jiang Juan's waist, pulled her into his embrace, and then softly brushed against the side of her face, his voice filled with regret, "Are you afraid?"</p><p>"It's already too late to be afraid."</p><p>Xue Fangli was smiling, but his tone was as cold as a venomous snake, "It's truly a pity. No matter how much you fear, Your Majesty will not easily let you go."</p>
