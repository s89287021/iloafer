						<p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>Can it be this way?</p><p>Jiang Juan was incredulous, "Do you have any reason to do this or not?"</p><p>Xue Fangli did not answer and instead asked him, "Hmm? Don't you remember that I am your wife?"</p><p>What could Jiang Juan say? He could only slowly reply, "Remember, right."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, squeezing his chin even tighter. He smiled as he asked, "Remember, right? Is there anything uncertain?"</p><p>It was too dangerous; at this moment, Xue Fangli's gaze and tone were equally threatening. Jiang Juan hurriedly clarified, "...There is nothing uncertain."</p><p>Xue Fangli did not respond, but the clear jointed fingers moved, playing with Jiang Juan's lips.</p><p>Besides kissing, he very much enjoyed rubbing Jiang Juan, especially his waist and lips.</p><p>That slender waist, barely a handful yet incredibly supple, when rubbed vigorously, made Jiang Juan fidget in his arms. His hair would pile up together, like petals that had been crushed into a ball, pitiful yet charming.</p><p>His lips were slightly pale, but after being rubbed for a while, they would glow with a rosy hue, full of vitality.</p><p>Jiang Juan felt uncomfortable from the rubbing and wanted to bite, but he dared not do so. After all, last night when he bit him once, things had gone terribly wrong. Jiang Juan could only let him rub himself.</p><p>But even though he was obedient, he still did not escape.</p><p>His lips turned a rosy hue from the rubbing. Xue Fangli leaned down and kissed him lightly several times before saying leisurely, "I am thinking... I should blame myself."</p><p>Jiang Juan had no memory, so he curiously asked, "What? What do you blame yourself for?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said in a leisurely manner, "Comparing me with those messy people is my fault."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "Ah?"</p><p>Xue Fangli: "There has been no marital intimacy between us to date. If I had been less lenient and cared more for your body, we might have gone further. Perhaps then you would understand our relationship better."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at Jiang Juan and said slowly, "Since that is the case, I will find someone else to help you take care of yourself in the future so that we can eventually engage in intimate activities."</p><p>Jiang Juan was a little dumbfounded, "No, no need."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled, "Why not? Do you know...?"</p><p>He lowered his head, his voice hoarse, "I might really become a saint by restraining myself."</p><p>This time, it wasn't just dangerous; Jiang Juan felt like he would be devoured alive at any moment.</p><p>As usual, Jiang Juan was being held in Xue Fangli's arms. He was truly restless now, and Jiang Juan frantically pushed Xue Fangli away, not wanting to be held anymore. But before he could even stand up, he was pulled back by the waist.</p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Jiang Juan's eyes darted around, "You... you're too stiff, I don't want to sit with you."</p><p>He had experienced the discomfort of this before and feared that sitting like this again would cause his skin to chafe. Jiang Juan said, "Let's take it slow, let me get used to it first, we... we..."</p><p>By the end, Jiang Juan was almost incoherent, inadvertently revealing his true thoughts, "It's too big, I can't do it."</p><p>Xue Fangli raised an eyebrow, seemingly pleased, and smiled, "What can't you do?"</p><p>"You can do it."</p><p>Whether one succeeds or fails is a matter for the future. Jiang Juan was panicked to the end, but he eventually came to his senses. After all, he was safe now, so Jiang Juan leaned back and salty tears clung to Xue Fangli's shoulder.</p><p>Do as you please.</p><p>Not long after, Gu Puwang brought Qi Xiuran from Dali Temple Prison.</p><p>That day, there were several incidents in the imperial palace, and Jiang Juan did not even bother to look at the faces beneath the masks. When Qi Xiuran was brought again today, he only felt a sense of unfamiliarity.</p><p>The youthful handsomeness that this face once had could still be faintly seen.</p><p>"Qi Xiuran."</p><p>Xue Fangli read out his name slowly, and Qi Xiuran looked at him with what seemed like resentment mixed with melancholy.</p><p>After staying in prison for several days, Qi Xiuran's clothes were messy, and weeds were tangled in his hair. However, from start to finish, his posture remained exquisite.</p><p>"Haven't you found it tragic over these years?"</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Even after removing the mask, you are still someone else."</p><p>Qi Xiuran was taken aback, as he had thought that Xue Fangli would interrogate him for wrongdoing but did not expect him to say this.</p><p>"I have nothing. If I want revenge, I must pay a price."</p><p>Qi Xiuran smiled; whether he was himself or someone else, it did not matter to him.</p><p>Over the years, he read the books Su Feiyue read and said the words she would say, becoming someone else. Only an empty shell remained within him, filled with resentment.</p><p>It was this resentment that had supported him until now, his sole reason for living.</p><p>"You can do it."</p><p>Whether success or failure comes to pass is a matter for the future. Jiang Juan's panic reached its peak, but he eventually calmed down. After all, he was safe now, so he leaned back and let salty tears rest against Xue Fangli's shoulder.</p><p>Do as you please.</p><p>Not long after, Gu Puwang brought Qi Xiuran from Dali Temple Prison.</p><p>That day, several incidents occurred in the imperial palace, and Jiang Juan did not even glance at the faces beneath the masks.

However, throughout it all, his posture remained exquisite.</p><p>"Haven't you found these years tragic?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Even after removing the mask, you are still someone else."</p><p>Qi Xiuran was taken aback, as he had expected Xue Fangli to interrogate him for wrongdoing but did not expect this response.</p><p>"I have nothing. If I want revenge, there must be a price."</p><p>Qi Xiuran smiled, indifferent to whether he was himself or someone else.</p><p>Over the years, he read the books Su Feiyue read and spoke the words she would say, becoming someone else. Only an empty shell remained within him, filled with resentment.</p><p>It was this very resentment that had sustained him until now, his sole reason for living.</p><p>"You can do it."</p><p>Whether success or failure is to come, it remains a matter for the future. Jiang Juan's panic reached its peak, but he eventually found solace in the knowledge that he was safe. He leaned back, salty tears clinging to Xue Fangli's shoulder.</p><p>Do as you please.</p><p>Not long after, Gu Puwang brought Qi Xiuran from Dali Temple Prison.</p><p>That day, several incidents unfolded within the imperial palace, and Jiang Juan had no time to notice the faces beneath the masks. When Qi Xiuran was brought before him once more, he felt an unfamiliar chill.</p><p>The youthful handsomeness that this face once held could still be faintly discerned.</p><p>"Qi Xiuran."</p><p>Xue Fangli enunciated his name slowly, and Qi Xiuran gazed at him with eyes filled with a mixture of resentment and melancholy.</p><p>After several days in prison, Qi Xiuran's garments were disheveled, weeds tangled within his hair. Yet, throughout it all, his posture remained exquisitely composed.</p><p>"Haven't you found these years tragic?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked, "Even after shedding the mask, you are still someone else."</p><p>Qi Xiuran was taken aback, expecting Xue Fangli to demand an explanation for his actions but instead receiving this cryptic remark.</p><p>"I have nothing. If I seek revenge, a price must be paid."</p><p>Qi Xiuran smiled, indifferent to whether he was himself or another person entirely.</p><p>Over the years, he had read every book Su Feiyue read and said every word she would speak, transforming into someone else. Only an empty shell remained within him, filled with resentment.</p><p>It was this very resentment that sustained him until now, his sole reason for living.</p><p>Zhiru sighed, "I only regret that I couldn't take your life. The wolf blood—once and now, it is the same."</p><p>"Do you truly not know who you hate?"</p><p>Staring at Zhiru for a few seconds, Xue Fangli opened his mouth again, "The father emperor captured her, forced her to give birth to a son, and made her suffer madly—it has nothing to do with me."</p><p>"You investigated that I went mad upon seeing blood, but you don't know how she died?"</p><p>Zhiru smiled, "It's related to you in some way, after all. Besides, she hated you."</p><p>"And what about you?"</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled slightly, "For years, she cried and struggled through, yet why did she break down on that one day?"</p><p>"She recognized you," Zhiru replied.</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke softly and slowly, "Before taking her own life, Su Fimei recovered from her illness and went to the palace to request marriage with the Princess. She—saw and recognized it was you."</p><p>On those nights, the woman cried with tears streaming down her face. She did not go mad or ignore people; she merely lay on the table crying nonstop.</p><p>Her words were fragmented.</p><p>"Desire is like holding a torch. Walking against the wind will inevitably burn your hands...1"</p><p>"Just as in a thorny forest, standing still means not being pricked. Without greedy thoughts, one can constantly enjoy the bliss of cessation. The moment greed arises, one is wounded by all things2."</p><p>He promised to take her away but did not keep his word.</p><p>He promised to take her away and went to the palace to request marriage with the Princess.</p><p>"She hated me, hated the father emperor; she..."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled faintly, "I also hate you."</p><p>Qi Xiuran was taken aback and felt it absurd, "What did you say?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke softly, "If I remember correctly, on that day, you were walking in the Imperial Garden with the Emperor. Coincidentally, she was also taking a stroll there, and she saw you."</p><p>Seeking to marry the Princess Chang, Qi Xiuran had acted as Su Feiyuejian for the first time, so he naturally remembered it well.</p><p>On that day, he toured the Imperial Garden with Emperor Hongxing. He encountered Jang Qingmei who was wandering around. At that moment, Qi Xiuran did not dare to look at her closely, afraid that he would reveal his feelings and thus ruin everything.</p><p>No longer as graceful and composed as before, urgency and anxiety crept into Qi Xiuran's expression. In disbelief, he asked, "She recognized me? She really recognized me on that day?"</p><p>"She wouldn't fail to recognize you," Xue Fangli said calmly, "Even if you turned into ashes, she would still know it was you."</p><p>It wasn't until he confirmed Qi Xiuran's identity that Xue Fangli understood these events.</p><p>He had originally thought that Jang Qingmei's rebellious behavior and refusal to be hurt unless provoked were out of concern for Qi Xiuran. In fact, her sorrow had reached its peak, and she was heartbroken.</p><p>A buzzing sound echoed in Qi Xiuran's mind, leaving him momentarily blank and a chill creeping up his spine.</p><p>"She thought you wouldn't come because the Emperor discovered it and worried about you every day, but then you changed your name and married your aunt."</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke softly and slowly, "In the end, you sought revenge for her but it was also you who caused her death. Instead of hating me, you should hate yourself more."</p><p>Qi Xiuran's entire body shuddered as he stared blankly at Xue Fangli. His lips moved but no words came out; all he could repeat was, "How could this be? How could this be?"</p><p>Xue Fangli watched with a cold eye on the absurdity of the situation; he had seen enough.</p><p>He had summoned Qi Xiuran only to avoid bearing those unfounded accusations. Xue Fangli did not care about them, but someone did.</p><p>"Take him away."</p><p>Xue Fangli lowered her chin and raised her eyes, refusing to give him another glance. However, Qi Xiuran struggled frantically as if driven by madness. He said in a dazed manner, "But I——only wanted to save her! From the very beginning, all I wanted was to save her; all I wanted was to take her away. Why didn't she wait? Wait for me? If she had only waited, just for a moment…"</p><p>As he spoke, Qi Xiuran nearly choked on his words.</p><p>He never thought that he would end up becoming one of the murderers.</p><p>Everything he did was meant to save her, yet it ended up killing her instead.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Why could this happen?</p><p>From Jiang Juan's perspective, only one word could describe the situation:</p><p>Fate played tricks.</p><p>Jiang Juan sighed deeply.</p><p>But from start to finish, Xue Fangli had been completely innocent.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Juan gently held his hand and hugged him tightly.</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, naturally understanding Jiang Juan's thoughts. He silently smiled, raised one hand, and lazily wrapped it around Jiang Juan's waist, pulling him into a full embrace.</p><p>At this point, the case of Princess Chang's forced abdication had become clear. For Su Feiyue and Jiang Qingmei, Xue Fuying and Qi Xiuran had collaborated for years in secret to seek revenge, with Duke Anping assisting them from the sidelines.</p><p>Xue Fangli said, "Aunt… take Princess Chang back to her mansion; she must never leave its grounds again. Qi Xiuran and Duke Anping will be exiled to Youzhou shortly and shall not leave this world."</p><p>Dali Temple Prison.</p><p>Gu Puwang delivered the message.</p><p>Schue Fu Ying gently stroked the egret emblem as she had been imprisoned for several days. Her appearance was haggard, but her spine remained straight throughout. She muttered to herself, "This nephew of mine, it seems, has no regard for anyone's life."</p><p>Duke Ping of Anping snorted in disdain, "He’s putting on an act!"</p><p>Gu Pu glanced at him and, remembering something, added, "My lord, the emperor has a message for you."</p><p>"When you initially entered the palace to request marriage from the late emperor, he did not grant your request. However, the new emperor, moved by your deep affection for Second Young Master, specially allowed you both to marry in prison and then go to Youzhou together."</p><p>Duke Ping of Anping’s face turned pale, "What?"</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Nian also paled, "What did you say?"</p><p>During his time in prison, Jiang Nian had been constantly anxious.</p><p>He had been arrested along with Princess Chang and others. Since Princess Chang held a special status and was considered the main culprit, they were confined to Dali Temple Prison. Jiang Nian, who did not have such standing, was kept in a common prison cell.</p><p>In recent days, Jiang Nian had been pondering how to clear himself of involvement. He even had some ideas, but this news left him reeling.</p><p>Being granted marriage with Duke Ping of Anping.</p><p>Being exiled to Youzhou alongside Duke Ping of Anping.</p><p>Jiang Nian knew very well what kind of person Duke Ping was, and given the current situation, he certainly did not want to be tied to Duke Ping. He even less wanted to be exiled to Youzhou!</p><p>After hearing this, Jiang Nian immediately broke down.</p><p>"I will not marry him!"</p><p>Jiang Nian shook his head fiercely and pleaded with the guard, "I am Second Young Master of the Ministry of Personnel. Please help me convey a message to my father; ask him to save me, please hurry!"</p><p>"Just tell my father it’s Jiang Nian, and he’ll see you. I am his most beloved son; after I’m released from prison, I will surely reward you generously. Please help me!"</p><p>The guard glanced at him but asked, "Is your father the Secretary of State Jiang? The Minister of Rites?"</p><p>Jiang Nian hurriedly replied, "Yes, he is! He is my father!"</p><p>The guard sympathetically said, "Because of you, your Secretary's residence has been ordered to be searched and confiscated. I suppose Minister Jiang has no time to take care of you anymore."</p><p>Jiang Nian was stunned, "What?"</p><p>The guard did not speak further and reached out to grab Jiang Nian. Jiang Nian suddenly came back to his senses and shouted, "I don't know! I know nothing! Prince Hou said he would go south, and coincidentally, I also had plans to go south, so I offered to join him. He took me to their camp."</p><p>"I know nothing! I am innocent…"</p><p>No matter how much he clarified, the guard forcefully dragged him out and pushed him aside. The Marquis of Anping was brought over by the guard as well, looking pale with anger, having clearly heard Jiang Nian's words just now.</p><p>In the dimly lit prison, there were only a few flickering candles. This was a hasty and poorly organized wedding, without a matchmaker, without any relatives, nothing at all.</p><p>"First bow to heaven and earth!"</p><p>Jiang Nian was brutally pressed down by the guard and bowed with the Marquis of Anping towards heaven and earth.</p><p>"Second bow to your parents!"</p><p>Jiang Nian was once again pressed down and bowed once more.</p><p>"Couple's bow—!"</p><p>Once they completed this bow, the ceremony was considered complete. He would have to follow the Marquis of Anping to Youzhou. Jiang Nian resisted to the utmost, struggling desperately, "Let me go! Let me go!"</p><p>"I will not marry him! I will not marry him!"</p><p>Jiang Nian broke down and said, "I won't go to Youzhou! He is the one who forced his way into the palace and plotted rebellion. I know nothing about it, it has nothing to do with me!"</p><p>Despite his repeated clarifications, he was still forced down to the ground. After the final bow, Jiang Nian finally married Marquis of Anping as wished. However, when he heard the prison guard's "ceremony complete," his vision went black, overwhelmed by anger and distress, causing him to faint!</p>
