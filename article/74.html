						<p>Prince Consort?</p><p>Why was he awarded the title of Prince Consort?</p><p>Jiang Juan asked blankly, "Then what about the Crown Prince?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing's expression was amiable. "You're the Prince Consort, so Fifth Prince wouldn't it be right for him to become the Crown Prince by virtue of your greatness?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???" </p><p>He had heard of such things before and was utterly shocked; his shock was written all over his face, and Emperor Hongxing smiled. "Has this emperor lied to you? Aren't I granting you a great reward?"</p><p>It wasn't just a great reward; Jiang Juan muttered, "This is too heavy."</p><p>The plot underwent major changes. Originally, the eldest prince was supposed to take charge of state affairs in his place, but now that he was out of the picture, Emperor Hongxing's intention was to establish the Prince as Crown Prince.</p><p>Jiang Juan hesitated for a moment and asked, "Your Majesty, does the Prince know that he will become the Crown Prince?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing smiled. "No, you should have asked if he knows that you will become the Prince Consort."</p><p>Jiang Juan blinked. "Then does the Prince know?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing replied, "He should know very soon."</p><p>After saying this, he stared at Jiang Juan intently, seemingly recalling something and sighed.</p><p>Just now, when Emperor Hongxing summoned Schue Fangli, he asked him only one question.</p><p>—"Do you still hate me?"</p><p>Xue Fanglei had nothing to say, only looking at Emperor Hongxing indifferently, with no emotion in his eyes.</p><p>He did not even want to put on a layer of mild mask anymore. The answer was evident, and Emperor Hongxing felt bitter in his heart, but he knew this was the punishment he deserved.</p><p>Fortunately, his son hated him but still cherished something in his heart.</p><p>For this cherishment, Lao Wu should accept this great gift.</p><p>Emperor Hongxing closed his eyes slightly and suddenly asked Jiang Juan, "How much do you know?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback, then realized that Emperor Hongxing was probably asking about the matters between Youmeiniang and the Prince. Jiang Juan hesitated before replying, "Youmeiniang hates the Prince, and the Prince also hates her, but... Your Majesty, it seems you want him to win her over, so the Prince has suffered a lot."</p><p>"I only..." Emperor Hongxing said slowly, "Who doesn't love their own child? She refused to stay by my side, let alone bear another child. With some attachment in her heart, she should change her mind, right?"</p><p>"Every time she tried to put Fanglei to death, I knew, and even I was there, but I still hoped," Emperor Hongxing said, "I treated it as a gamble. Gambling that she wouldn't really do it and that she would eventually give in..."</p><p>"She didn't, and she never gave in. If she doesn't love him, then so be it. She hates me and Fanglei, and there has been no change."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing's voice faded away. Sitting on the dragon bed, he no longer had the dignity Jiang Juan saw when they first met. His hair was disheveled, his eyes bloodshot, like a defeated man rather than the supreme ruler.</p><p>"Qingmei... she won."</p><p>A bitter taste filled his throat.</p><p>In Yangxindian Palace...</p><p>Xue Fanglei repeated again, "Empress Mei, what happened to my wife?"</p><p>His tone was unfriendly. Empress Mei shivered at the words and forced a smile, "Your Highness, you're saying this? Your Highness' wife cried and came to question me."</p><p>Empress Mei really felt wronged.</p><p>She harbored a mischief-making heart, relying on the Empress Dowager's presence to make her take action against Lady Liwang. However, Su Jiaoma, Jiang General, and Gu Censor all came to her aid, so she failed by a hair's breadth. </p><p>The Empress Dowager would just give him a light tap or two and burst into tears, is this playing the fool? </p><p>There were not many concubines for Emperor Hongxing, yet the drama of vying for favor was inevitable. Like Jiang Juan, others provoked her but would cry when Emperor Hongxing appeared; Mei Fei had seen it all before.</p><p>If the other concubines enjoyed stirring up trouble, Mei Fei would surely deal with them harshly. However, she couldn't do so with Jiang Juan, who even had to apologize: "Your Highness, I believe there was... some misunderstanding."</p><p>"Misunderstanding?"</p><p>Among those present, only Mei Fei had a grudge against Jiang Juan. As for others, even if they were foolish enough, they wouldn't dare provoke Jiang Juan. He sneered lightly, "Since Empress Dowager believes in a misunderstanding, this King can only ask others about it."</p><p>"The Emperor is inside; if there was indeed a misunderstanding, if not, this King will have the Emperor judge today."</p><p>Mei Fei's expression changed; the Emperor had hit her sore spot. She feared losing favor and, after much thought, gritted her teeth: "Perhaps... it was Empress Dowager."</p><p>Xue Fangli frowned, "Hmm?"</p><p>Seeing Jiang Juan's tears, he didn't think she intended to provoke the Empress Dowager. Jiang Juan was timid; she wouldn't dare to provoke the Empress Dowager on her own. The Empress Dowager had been warned by him before and shouldn't have provoked Jiang Juan again either, so Xue Fangli ruled out the Empress Dowager.</p><p>Mei Fei narrated the events roughly: "Empress Dowager was quite distressed lately and said some not-so-nice words; Wangfei he..."</p><p>Not-so-nice words were probably those terms like 'bastard' or 'omen', suggesting she shouldn't live.</p><p>Xue Fangli heard but couldn't be bothered to respond.</p><p>His grandmother could only move her mouth now. What else was she capable of?</p><p>"This King doesn't mind, but he was... meddlesome."</p><p>Xue Fangli let out a light snort, seemingly displeased, yet his crimson lips curled slightly upward.</p><p>Mei Fei: "..."</p><p>Do you really think too much of it?</p><p>Then, what are you laughing about?</p><p>Mei Fei looked at him in surprise, forgetting to continue speaking. Xue Fangli glanced over and withdrew his smile, giving her a cold look with thin eyebrows: "And then."</p><p>Mei Fei hastily said, "The Princess Dowager rebutted a few words, the Empress Dowager became furious, almost... hit the Princess Dowager across the face."</p><p>Xue Fangli suddenly lifted his eyelid, looking at Mei Fei coldly. Mei Fei's heart skipped a beat, feeling a chill run down her back. She hurriedly added, "But she didn't hit her down. A few officials—Jia Ma, Jiang Jiangjuan, and Gu Chen—intervened, and the Empress Dowager left."</p><p>"But she didn't hit her down?"</p><p>His grandmother, really doesn't learn.</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression darkened.</p><p>Mei Fei had never mentioned herself as someone who stirred up trouble from beginning to end, but she still felt uneasy. She said to Xue Fangli, "This Palace shall go first..."</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled enigmatically, "Grandmother wanted to hit him, so what about Princess Dowager Mei?"</p><p>"This Palace..."</p><p>Mei Fei moved her lips, instinctively reaching for her chest, but found it empty. Her movement paused as she remembered the lesson from before and finally said, "This Palace only mentioned that day's eavesdropping incident to the Empress Dowager."</p><p>How did she mention it? She must have been up to no good, yet Mei Fei didn't mention a word about it. But even if she didn't say anything, Xue Fangli already had an idea. He nodded slightly, "This King understands."</p><p>With that, Xue Fangli turned and walked into the Yangxin Palace.</p><p>He said nothing, did nothing, yet it caused Princess Mei to feel an intense sense of unease. She bit her lip and frowned tightly, only able to console herself silently.</p><p>It’s alright, it’s alright.</p><p>"Your Majesty, she didn’t win; you made a mistake."</p><p>When Jiang Juan said this, Xue Fangli entered the Yangxin Hall. He glanced at Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Prince."</p><p>Seeing Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan squinted her eyes in what seemed to be an expression of happiness, with sparkling eyes. Xue Fangli nodded, his tone matter-of-fact, but his demeanor inexplicably softened a bit.</p><p>"Cough, cough, cough."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing was smiling but could not stop coughing. Wang Zongguan hurriedly handed him a handkerchief. He wiped hastily and then sat up straight again, smiling: "Old Fifth, I gave you this princess a generous gift just now, do you know what it is?"</p><p>Xue Fangli asked without much interest: "What?"</p><p>"I am awarding her the position of Crown Princess. What are your thoughts on that?"</p><p>A long time ago, Emperor Hongxing had intended to make him Crown Prince, but Xue Fangli had never shown any interest.</p><p>Even though many people coveted this position, and it was within his reach, for Xue Fangli, it held little meaning. After all, even his survival in this world lacked significance, existing solely out of a sense of hatred.</p><p>—Too many people wanted him dead; yet he chose to live.</p><p>Since Jiang Juan appeared.</p><p>The young man possessed a compassionate heart, and the grudges and hardships Xue Fangli had endured over the years were given new meaning—to soften the young man’s heart, to make him feel compassion, to have him experience more pain, and to hold on to himself longer.</p><p>From his first attempt at coercion, tricking the young man into softening his heart and making him look adoringly at him, Xue Fangli had already reconciled with his past.</p><p>He said nothing, did nothing, yet it caused Princess Mei an intense sense of unease. She bit her lip tightly, frowning deeply, only able to console herself silently.</p><p>It's okay, it's okay.</p><p>"Your Majesty, she didn't win; you made a mistake."</p><p>As Jiang Juan spoke these words, Xue Fangli entered the Yangxin Hall and glanced at Jiang Juan.</p><p>"Prince."</p><p>Seeing Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan squinted her eyes in what appeared to be an expression of happiness, with sparkling eyes.

She bit her lip tightly, her brow furrowed deeply, only able to console herself silently.</p><p>It’s alright, it’s alright.</p><p>"Your Majesty, she didn’t win; you made a mistake."</p><p>As Jiang Juan spoke these words, Xue Fangli entered the Yangxin Hall and glanced at her. </p><p>"Prince."</p><p>Seeing Xue Fangli, Jiang Juan squinted her eyes in what seemed to be an expression of happiness, with sparkling eyes.

His thoughts were solely of the youth, his mind and eyes filled only with the youth.</p><p>He even rejoiced that these hardships were plentiful enough.</p><p>He always——was in fear.</p><p>Xue Fangli’s heart moved with concern, yet the youth should have no qualms.</p><p>He should be carefree and fearless.</p><p>Xue Fangli——did not speak. In the long silence, Hongxing Emperor kept staring——at him.</p><p>Would he accept it?</p><p>For her, his concubine.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>Hongxing Emperor closed his eyes.</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>In the next second, Xue Fangli calmly uttered two words.</p><p>This moment, the Hongxing Emperor had imagined many times. But truly——being harshly rejected again, he——lost composure, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p>Xue Fangli's expression remained unchanged. "Father Emperor, I have fulfilled your wish regarding the position of Crown Prince. I also have a request to make."</p><p>Emperor Hongxing hurriedly said: "Speak."</p><p>The Empress Dowager was quite old and had gotten into a sedan chair. She felt extremely tired, with her head pounding. A maidservant approached quietly and massaged her temples.</p><p>The sedan chair swayed back and forth as the Empress Dowager propped up her face. Her eyelids drooped, and she fell asleep. Suddenly, shouts were heard from behind.</p><p>"Empress Dowager!"</p><p>"Empress Dowager—!"</p><p>Wang Zongguan's voice was shrill and thin. He carried a lantern and ran over quickly. The Empress Dowager woke up, recognizing Wang Zongguan's voice. She hurriedly ordered the sedan chair to stop.</p><p>"Empress Dowager, His Majesty has come to see you."</p><p>The Empress Dowager was stunned, then joyfully exclaimed: "His Royal Highness is seeing this old woman?"</p><p>The maidservant beamed with happiness upon hearing that: "Empress Dowager, what good news!"</p><p>Her previous fatigue vanished instantly. The Empress Dowager's face lit up in a smile. "Quickly return to the Yangxin Palace. His Royal Highness is seeing this old woman."</p><p>The palace attendants who were carrying the sedan chair said "Aye" and hurriedly turned around, rushing back on the same path. Wang Zongguan carried the lantern and chased after them, sighing inwardly but showing no trace of joy on his face.</p><p>In a short time, they arrived at Yangxin Palace. The Empress Dowager practically flew there, almost leaving the maidservant behind as she chased after her. She covered her mouth to laugh. "Empress Dowager, please slow down a little."</p><p>It had been ten years since Emperor Hongxing refused to see his mother, creating a rift between them. This was the first time in ten years that he agreed to meet her. Would Empress Dowager be able to hold back?</p><p>"I have my reasons," replied the Empress Dowager with a laugh as she pushed open the door of Yangxin Palace.</p><p>"Your Majesty..."</p><p>In the Palace of Tranquility, Lady Mei knelt on the ground, anxiously asking, "What have I done?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing asked, "What? It's you who should be asking what happened. Someone brought a petition to me."</p><p>Lady Mei was stunned and instinctively asked him, "But did Consort Ning—did she say anything to Your Majesty?"</p><p>"If it was about the morning tea, Your Majesty, do not believe her!" Lady Mei hastily denied, "She poured tea on me while serving it, I just lost my temper..."</p><p>The emperor frowned. "Consort Ning?"</p><p>Seeing his reaction, Lady Mei panicked and asked again, "Could it be Princess Shude?"</p><p>"Your Majesty, I strangled the silk you rewarded her with, there was a reason!"</p><p>Lady Mei urgently defended herself, "We are about to offer sacrifices to our ancestors; how can one wear red and look flamboyant? She insisted on making a dress for herself, I thought it inappropriate..."</p><p>She couldn't continue, as the excuses were flimsy. She tried to steady herself and put on her usual demure act, "Your Majesty, what really happened?"</p><p>This usually worked, but now when she looked up, she saw Emperor Hongxing with pursed lips, seemingly extremely angry, about to speak but instead started coughing. Lady Mei was startled.</p><p>"Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p>She grabbed a handkerchief to wipe him, but he pushed her away in anger. "I never knew you were the leader of the palace!"</p><p>"As one of the consorts, she should have served tea for you?" Emperor Hongxing said, "You say it's sacrilegious to wear red and flamboyant before ancestral sacrifices, what color is your dress then?"</p><p>"I thought you had a small temper but could recognize the bigger picture, that's why I entrusted the phoenix seal to you. But..."</p><p>"You are secretly so tyrannical!"</p><p>Mei Fei stiffened, didn't you know about these things?</p><p>What exactly were these things?</p><p>Emperor Hongxing saw her reaction and said coldly, "Are you still having trouble with the Fifth Prince's consort?"</p><p>It turned out so.</p><p>It was Li Li.</p><p>Mei Fei's figure swayed. As soon as she was summoned, she faced Emperor Hongxing's interrogation and became flustered, even forgetting about something, only to reveal many things!</p><p>Mei Fei's face paled. Emperor Hongxing expressed his disappointment, "You hold the Phoenix Seal; you should lead the harem, yet you are utterly unworthy of your position!"</p><p>"Hand over the Phoenix Seal and go receive your punishment—fifty lashes!"</p><p>As the Phoenix Seal was handed over, all her years of effort were about to be in vain. Mei Fei pleaded, "Your Majesty, I dare not defy you any further; please spare me this time..."</p><p>She begged while crawling towards Emperor Hongxing, trying to reach for his sleeves. He raised his hand, and she missed, falling flat. Emperor Hongxing said coldly, "My will is set."</p><p>Mei Fei collapsed on the ground, tears streaming down silently.</p><p>Empress Dowager watched the farce quietly, her heart sinking bit by bit, but still holding onto some hope. She smiled faintly and asked, "Did His Majesty summon me to come to terms?"</p><p>Emperor Hongxing only replied coldly, "Mother, in a few days, I will have someone take you to Zhao'an Temple. From then on... you will remain with the lanterns and ancient Buddha at Zhao'an Temple, never returning to the palace again."</p>
