						<p>The Holy Emperor left the palace, and his entourage was indeed grand, a huge procession of people.</p><p>At the beginning of March, which is already the season for spring outings, the Peonies Garden was in full bloom with pink and white cherry blossoms. Therefore, young masters and misses had made appointments to go on an outing there.</p><p>Jiang Nian and Duke An Ping were among them.</p><p>"Seen Your Majesty."</p><p>Everyone took their leave one after another. After saying he would pass by, Emperor Hongxing truly wandered around for a while. But Jiang Nian noticed that there was also a carriage accompanying the emperor, and the person inside had not shown himself throughout, only glancing out occasionally.</p><p>As most people left, the carriage finally showed some movement.</p><p>A man stepped out. He was tall with a complex black-golden robe, handsome in appearance but seemed to have a suppressed malevolence, making him look sinisterly beautiful.</p><p>In his arms was a young man who bowed and said something to a servant before taking a step forward.</p><p>It was Prince Li.</p><p>The person in his arms was his younger brother.</p><p>Every time he saw this brother of his, he would be nestled in the man's embrace. Who would have thought he had such a spineless nature?</p><p>Jiang Nian curled up the corner of his lips and smiled. Then, turning back, he saw Duke An Ping staring intently in one direction—the Pear Blossom Garden where Prince Li had entered, with a complex expression.</p><p>Jiang Nian frowned and asked sternly, "Duke, what are you looking at?"</p><p>Duke An Ping turned away his gaze, maintaining a composed posture, "Prince Li. The person he is carrying in his arms... could it be Jiang Juan?"</p><p>Jiang Nian: "Mm."</p><p>Anping Marquis spoke in a low voice, "What propriety is this?"</p><p>Strangely enough, it was he who thought about it.</p><p>Duke Ling had always been strict with his etiquette and would stare at it for a long time, but he only found it absurd.</p><p>Jiang Nian shook his head and thought to himself that he had overreacted. He smiled and said, "Prince Wang is like this, how would others feel if they were in his place?"</p><p>Said and done, Jiang Nian lowered his eyes, feeling regretful. He was supposed to admire the cherry blossoms with Anping Marquis but, inexplicably, he said, "Your Highness, are you thinking of accompanying His Majesty? If so, go find His Majesty first; I will come for you later."</p><p>Anping Marquis asked him, "Why?"</p><p>Jiang Nian smiled and replied, "His Majesty shouldn't stay too long. If you accompany me first, he might leave by the time you get there."</p><p>He made a reasonable point, and Anping Marquis thought for a moment, "Alright then."</p><p>The two went their separate ways. Jiang Nian took a deep breath and entered the Plum Blossom Garden.</p><p>Amidst the falling petals, a soft couch was placed under the shade of plum blossoms. Xue Fangli bent down to lay Jiang Juan down.</p><p>Transferred from his embrace to another place, even with the best sleep, there were signs that Jiang Juan was waking up. Xue Fangli brushed away a lock of hair from his side face and reached out to wrap his shoulder, lightly patting him in a relaxed manner.</p><p>Though he had no expression, his actions carried a hint of tenderness.</p><p>This tenderness, even if only a trace, coming from King Li, was enough to astonish people.</p><p>Jiang Nian stared at it for a long time, took a step closer, and pretended to stumble upon him, "…Your Highness, you are here too?"</p><p>Xue Fangli raised his head. Jiang Nian continued, "Is something wrong with my brother? Did he fall asleep?"</p><p>Jiang Nian worriedly asked, "His body is weak; if he stays here, he might get cold."</p><p>Xue Fangli finally raised his eyelids, smiling and said something, but he ignored Jiang Nian.</p><p>"Your Majesty has said that no one is allowed to enter the Plum Garden. Are you deaf?"</p><p>Jiang Nian froze, then smiled apologetically: "My Lord, it's the guards' fault. I knew you were with your younger brother, so I rudely barged in."</p><p>"What if you know," Xue Fangli said word by word, "do you still want to leave?"</p><p>His tone was very cold, almost freezing, as he looked at Jiang Nian heavily. That sinister aura made Jiang Nian feel both fear and resentment.</p><p>Why?</p><p>He had been reborn once, changing many things, but he could never change the Li Wang's attitude toward him.</p><p>If the Li Wang treated everyone like that, it would be fine, but he treated Jiang Juan so specially.</p><p>Why? Why? Why?</p><p>Jiang Nian clenched his palm hard. He was unwilling, truly unwilling. If Jiang Juan could do it, why couldn't he?</p><p>In the past, Jiang Juan had merely been his sidekick, imitating everything he did and being constantly overshadowed by him.</p><p>Their father favored him, and Jiang Juan's fiancé admired him. Even if Jiang Juan was the most beautiful person in the capital, she was known as the First Beauty of the Imperial City.</p><p>But such a Jiang Juan still received the Li Wang's favor.</p><p>It was the Li Wang whom he avoided but secretly liked.</p><p>Jealousy almost devoured Jiang Nian, and he lost his reason. His chest rose and fell, and he looked down and said, "My Lord, is he really worthy of your treatment?"</p><p>"Do you know that he is deeply in love with Marquis, not only pushing me into the lake but even daring to dream of climbing into Marquis's bed."</p><p>Silence, within the Hetian Manor, a sudden hush fell.</p><p>Dàozhīguò le jiǔ, Xue Fangli smiled. "He is kind-hearted; no matter how angry he gets with you, it's only pushing you into the lake. This king would do the same."</p><p>"If you say one more word, I will wake him up, and today I will bind your hands and feet and sink you in the lake."</p><p>His voice was light and slow, yet his laugh was terrifying, like that of a demon, sending shivers down one's spine.</p><p>Zhè gǔ sēnlěng de hán yì, also pulled Jiang Nian out of his daze. He looked at Xue Fangli in fear.</p><p>These words, if coming from another person, might just be threats, but coming from King Li, he would do it!</p><p>Fear and regret mixed in his heart. Jiang Nian felt rooted to the spot, not daring to move. At this moment, he heard Xue Fangli say again, "Young Master, do you really think this king knows all your thoughts?"</p><p>He scoffed lightly, "Your hidden gaze is truly disgusting."</p><p>He knew!</p><p>He actually knew!</p><p>This realization left Jiang Nian stunned, as if someone had slapped him hard. His blood surged with shame, and the feeling of helplessness and suffocation from his previous life overwhelmed him again. He clenched his fists and bit his teeth, forcing himself not to let out a sound.</p><p>Until Manager Wang found them.</p><p>"Your Highness, Your Highness—!"</p><p>"The Emperor is searching for you everywhere. Quickly go with me to Xingyuan."</p><p>After Manager Wang finished speaking, seeing Jiang Nian there too, he added, "Young Master, come along as well; the Marquis is here too."</p><p>Jiang Nian was still in a daze and took a while to regain his composure before whispering, "Alright."</p><p>Xue Fangli, however, instructed the guards: "Watch him closely. If he wakes up, bring him over."</p><p>The guards all responded in unison, but Jiang Nian's heart remained as cold as ice.</p><p>Duke Li knew his intentions.</p><p>This lifetime, Duke Li could see it; in his previous life, Duke Li had seen it as well.</p><p>But he was unmoved.</p><p>He repeatedly trampled on his sincerity and his dignity.</p><p>He——</p><p>Was doing just fine.</p><p>Jiang Nian's breathing was rapid, blood trickling from his pinched palm.</p><p>The bamboo grove was tranquil, with the water winding around.</p><p>A wine cup was placed upstream. When released, it floated downstream, reaching Yang Liusheng amidst laughter. He picked it up and drank it all in one go.</p><p>"Brother Yang has a great alcohol tolerance!"</p><p>"Our capital's water not only nourishes people but also treats guests well!"</p><p>"That's true. In ten out of eight times, Brother Yang drinks the wine from this flowing cup."</p><p>Yang Liusheng came to the capital for the first time this year, not only to reunite with old friends but also to seek an audience with Jiang Nian. He hurriedly asked, "Where is Young Master Jiang?"</p><p>He went to Hetang Garden.</p><p>Yang Liusheng hurriedly excused himself: "Everyone, I'm going to look for the Young Master."</p><p>It was well known that he had a passion for beautiful women and only admired painted beauties. Therefore, no one tried to retain him. Only his friend said, "Brother Yang, the beauty of this Young Master is unlike that of ordinary beauties."</p><p>There wasn't much else to it; whenever Yang Liusheng opened his mouth, he was extremely harsh. His friend was purely offering well-intentioned advice to prevent him from feeling attracted at first glance and then changing his mind later, which would force him to visit and apologize.</p><p>Regarding this Young Master Jiang Nian, Yang Liusheng had long heard many things about him, especially as the person reminding him was one of the few who knew about it.</p><p>——The beauty of the Young Master is not superficial. He may appear ordinary at first glance, but he is very endearing to look at for a long time. His personality is gentle and amiable, making anyone who interacts with him feel like they are basking in spring. Moreover, the Young Master himself is well-versed in poetry and books, giving him an extremely elegant demeanor, earning him the nickname 'Little Immortal Poet.'</p><p>Yang Liusheng was homeless and had traveled all over southern China, having seen many beauties. However, he had never encountered anyone like Jiang Nian before, so he became even more interested. He waved his hand and said, "Understood."</p><p>Humming a little tune, Yang Liusheng arrived at Hetang Garden.</p><p>Before stepping in, he looked out and was stunned on the spot.</p><p>The ground was covered with blooming hawthorn flowers, and a person on a soft sofa seemed to be asleep.</p><p>The colors of the flowers were dazzling, almost hallucinatory, yet the person was serene and gentle, as pure as snow or moonlight. The most striking color on his body was that of his long hair, which resembled clouds.</p><p>Yang Liusheng arrived just in time. Soon, the young man slowly woke up and sat up from the sofa with assistance.</p><p>His disheveled hair fell onto his shoulders, touching his snow-white neck. A servant came forward to speak with him about something, and hawthorn flowers landed in his hair and on his neck, their vibrant colors stunningly beautiful. However, he looked listless and powerless.</p><p>Drunk with love for the peonies, it seems the young master is still sleeping!1!</p><p>For some reason, Yang Liusheng remembered this line.</p><p>Truly, it was a deep sleep of spring hawthorns, with incomparable beauty!</p><p>Yang Liusheng was stunned by the beauty, wanting to immediately paint a "Spring Sleep of the Begonias" painting. However, as soon as he took a step forward, he was intercepted by the guards and stopped from entering.</p><p>Yang Liusheng scratched his head in anxiety. At that moment, his friend called him from afar, "Brother Yang! Brother Yang!"</p><p>Fearing to disturb the beauty, Yang Liusheng quickly turned around. His friend exclaimed in surprise, "You were lucky! The Emperor is also at the Hundred Flowers Garden today and specially summoned you. Come with me!"</p><p>Yang Liusheng was taken aback, "But—"</p><p>His friend didn't notice Yang Liusheng's hesitation and dragged him far away. Yang Liusheng finally managed to come back to his senses and exclaimed in amazement, "Young Master Jiang Nian is truly the first beauty!"</p><p>At the same time, a servant said to Jiang Juan, "Princess, Prince and the Emperor are at the Apricot Garden. You should go there after waking up."</p><p>Thinking he was going for a spring outing, Jiang Juan woke up to find himself being forcefully taken out for a spring outing. He bumped into the railing, feeling like life wasn't worth living.</p><p>Spring outing. Hundred Flowers Garden.</p><p>After confirming the keywords, it was clearly about the spring outing scene in the original text.</p><p>Jiang Juan found himself at the main stage of the protagonist's story.</p><p>He fell into deep thought.</p><p>Was Prince really that skilled at flipping him over? He had already adapted to the point where even being thrown into a pot of oil would allow him to calmly spread out like a salted fish pancake.</p><p>Alright, he needed to perk up.</p><p>Prince had been waiting for him for a long time and could afford to be flamboyant. However, after sending off Prince, he still wanted to enjoy his life as a happy salted fish.</p><p>He couldn't offend the protagonist again!</p><p>Today, he would be extra careful.</p><p>Jiang Juan finished her preparations, turned to the attendant, and said, "I am going to Xingyuan."</p><p>Xingyuan.</p><p>"Subject —— Yang Liusheng has seen His Majesty."</p><p>"In reply to His Majesty, I admire beautiful women. As long as I see a beautiful woman, I feel immensely pleased and elated."</p><p>"Oh? Who did you see?"</p><p>Yang Liusheng: "Young Master Jiang Nian."</p><p>Upon mentioning Jiang Nian, his words flowed like a torrent, "The water in the capital truly nourishes people. It is said that Young Master Jiang is not immediately stunning to behold, but his bone structure is beautiful. One must be patient and observe him calmly, but upon my first sight of him just now, I felt he possessed an ethereal presence, truly like a celestial being, with ice-like skin and snow-like bones!"</p><p>Yang Liusheng spoke in high praise, seemingly unaware that everyone was looking in the same direction.</p><p>Jiang Nian had just been humiliated and was quietly drinking tea at the moment. With his lowered eyes, he thought of Liewang and Jiang Juan. Jealousy and resentment sparked numerous thoughts within him —— today's humiliation, he would make Liewang and Jiang Juan pay back doubly!</p><p>His name was suddenly mentioned, and Jiang Nian raised his head to listen for a moment. The twisted emotions in his heart were finally suppressed, and Jiang Nian felt slightly better.</p><p>Yes, the title of the capital's most beautiful man brought him no benefits, nor did it mean much, but it was the result of his efforts after rebirth, carefully making friends with everyone and constantly catering to their preferences.</p><p>Taking another sip of tea under everyone's gaze, Jiang Nian smiled slightly and calmly said, "Mr. Liu, you flatter me too much."</p><p>Yang Liusheng was taken aback, glanced at him briefly, but did not pay much attention or understand why this person was flattering him. He continued enthusiastically, "How can it be mere flattery? Young Master Jiang's appearance is unparalleled in all of China and the south. I have never seen anyone with such beauty! He ——"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, someone entered Xingyuan. Yang Liusheng looked up and saw the young man who had been sleeping in the Hibiscus Courtyard earlier. His eyes lit up instantly, and he enthusiastically welcomed him, "Young Master Jiang! Young Master Jiang Nian!"</p><p>Jiang San Gongzi Juan: "???"</p>
