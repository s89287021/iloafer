						<p>Five years ago?</p><p>Jiang Nian was taken aback, "What happened?"</p><p>Gu Puwang asked lightly, "What exactly happened five years ago?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>Silence, a long silence.</p><p>Jiang Nian, who had come for today's appointment and whose birthday coincided with his, now felt quite embarrassed, and his smile faded somewhat.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jiang Nian frowned, "Wasn't it that I was kidnapped by thugs, or did I encounter them again at Luofeng Mountain?"</p><p>In reality, it was far more complex.</p><p>Five years ago, the then young Jiang Nian knew that Gu's only son, Gu Puwang, would be abducted by thugs in the near future. He also knew that Gu Puwang would be rescued by a local villager on Luofeng Mountain, but at the time, Gu Puwang was running a high fever and his memory was fragmented.</p><p>Jiang Nian had long begged his father to send him back home to visit his grandparents, but he diverted to Luofeng Mountain halfway through, claiming this credit for himself.</p><p>The reason -- in his previous life, Duke Ping An's ascension to the throne also had Gu's contribution, and Jiang Nian had wholeheartedly supported Duke Ping An. Gu's only son, Gu Puwang, was also quite influential at court.</p><p>As long as he befriended Gu Puwang, he could tie himself to the Gu family network, which is why Jiang Nian rushed to Luofeng Mountain at the right time.</p><p>But he would never admit this truth.</p><p>Gu Puwang was aloof and reclusive, hard to approach. With the help of this life-saving deed, it took Jiang Nian nearly five years to gain Gu Puwang's acceptance, although compared to Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang, Gu Puwang's attitude could only be described as lukewarm. Still, he was not someone who could be easily warmed up.</p><p>Jiang Nian: "Why are you asking about this now?"</p><p>Gu Puwang: "Someone recognized me yesterday. She said... when I was rescued by a villager in Luofeng Mountain, I have no memory of it, only remembering waking up in an abandoned temple."</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyelids twitched.</p><p>How could this be possible?</p><p>No one should know about this matter.</p><p>It shouldn't be so coincidental.</p><p>Jiang Nian's eyes flickered. "Who told you? Should I believe her? The events from back then, my memory is incomplete; I can't recall anything else... forget it. Could it be that I don't remember the high fever when I was taken care of in the abandoned temple?"</p><p>The more he spoke, the less he could control himself, almost to an aggressive extent. However, Gu Puwang remained calmly and didn't interrupt him.</p><p>Only after Jiang Nian finished speaking did Gu Puwang say, "I remember it, but—"</p><p>"Niangge, I asked about what happened five years ago."</p><p>Gu Puwang said slowly, "Your ancestors are from Jiangbei. If you came home to visit relatives, why would you appear in Luofeng Mountain?"</p><p>Jiang Nian replied calmly, "We were traveling hurriedly and encountered foggy weather. The driver took the wrong direction."</p><p>This explanation had been given several times before, and when Gu Puwang asked about it, Jiang Nian could still handle the situation. However, Gu Puwang was sharp-witted, so Jiang Nian didn't dare to say too much, fearing he might reveal something.</p><p>"Don't you believe me?"</p><p>Jiang Nian took the initiative. His eyelashes trembled as if there were tears in his eyes. "I've been here for five years; wouldn't you know my character? How can others say so and you believe it?"</p><p>But he forgot that Gu Puwang was not Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang.</p><p>"Niangge, I know."</p><p>Gu Puwang looked at Jiang Nian with an unchanged expression and said, "It is precisely because I know that I ask."</p><p>Jiang Nian's lips moved slightly, "…"</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Why did he forget?</p><p>Throughout all these years, Gu Puwang had stayed aloof from the three of them. It was as if he was friendly with him but not too close. He seemed more like an observer always watching, and on several occasions, Jiang Nian felt that Gu Puwang could easily see through him.</p><p>But since Gu Puwang never said anything about it, Jiang Nian did not bring it up either, and they lived in relative peace for many years.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Nian felt extremely angry.</p><p>He had spent so much time and thought so hard, only to end up with this?</p><p>Gu Puwang was questioning him.</p><p>Why couldn't he just unconditionally stand by his side?</p><p>Even if Gu Puwang wasn't saved by him, these past years, he had treated Gu Puwang decently. Why did he have to be so stubborn about it? Like always, pretending not to know wouldn't work?</p><p>Almost instantly, Jiang Nian made up his mind. With tears welling in his eyes, he said, "… don’t believe me."</p><p>"For the past five years, haven’t I treated you well? How can you easily believe someone else’s slander, …"</p><p>He could barely speak, as if he was on the verge of breaking down. Jiang Nian looked at Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang with a pale face.</p><p>"What about them?"</p><p>Jiang Nian asked, "Could it be that they doubt me just like him?"</p><p>That may be true, but in Jiang Nian’s world, Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang certainly did not possess such intelligence. They also wouldn’t listen to him if he were to speak to them, and if forced to choose a side, Jiang Nian was certain they would stand by his side.</p><p>"Not..."</p><p>Xue Jun stammered as he opened his mouth.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Jiang Nian’s eyes flickered; he knew this too. </p><p>But in the next second, reality slapped him hard.</p><p>"Brother Nian, tell me the truth," Xue Jun said with a bitter expression.</p><p>Jiang Nian was clearly unwilling to admit it, but Xue Jun wanted to give him one last chance. If Jiang Nian admitted his mistake and apologized sincerely, Xue Jun would give him another chance.</p><p>However, in Jiang Nian’s view, this meant that Xue Jun had taken Gu Puwang’s side.</p><p>"..."</p><p>Jiang Nian looked at him in disbelief, unable to form a complete sentence for quite some time. His body trembled slightly, as if he had just suffered a huge blow. He turned to Jiang Qingliang and asked, "Gu Puwang doesn’t believe me; Xue Jun doesn’t believe me, what about you?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang avoided his gaze, saying, "Brother Nian, it’s not that I don’t believe you—it’s just—"</p><p>"That the person who truly saved Gu Puwang is Mr. Baichao."</p><p>Just one sentence sent Jiang Nian into a cold abyss.</p><p>"What!?"</p><p>Snow White Morning?</p><p>How could it be Snow White Morning?</p><p>In an instant, all the color drained from Jiang Nian's face. Unlike his earlier act, at this moment he truly felt embarrassed; years of meticulously prepared lies and masks were torn open unexpectedly.</p><p>Humiliating, so humiliating.</p><p>"Niang…"</p><p>"How did they find out?"</p><p>Jiang Nian almost exhausted all his strength to ask that question.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang hesitated for a moment, deliberately omitting the part about the Orchid Pavilion, after all, she was Jiang Juan's maid. She said vaguely, "Mr. Bai's servant…"</p><p>But how could Jiang Nian be easily deceived? After a while of silence, he asked, "Was it someone from Princess Jang—Taizi's people who said so? I guessed it must have been that maid around him."</p><p>Originally fearing involvement with Jiang Juan, Jiang Qingliang did not dare to reveal the truth. Now that Jiang Nian had figured it out, she could only say, "Well… I was just recognized, but it wasn't Brother Juan's doing; it's just—"</p><p>Before she finished her sentence, Jiang Nian interrupted her, his voice sharp and piercing, "What did you call him?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was stunned, "Brother Juan?"</p><p>"Brother Juan, what a Brother Juan."</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Nian could no longer control himself. That 'Brother Juan' made him feel both offended and amused.</p><p>Clenching his fists tightly, he asked word by word, "When did your relationship get so close that you can call him Brother Juan?"</p><p>"Could it be you've forgotten? He pushed me into the lake; it was this wretch who pushed me into the lake!"</p><p>Jiang Nian hated Jiang Juan, but this hatred stemmed from his jealousy. Initially, Jiang Nian could still console himself, thinking that Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang were on his side, as well as Gu Puwang. However, now—</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was actually shouting "Brother Juan!"</p><p>Gu Puwang and Xue Jun even believed their maid's words!</p><p>"Why can't they associate with him? Do they know how despicable he is? He made me suffer humiliation at the Princess Chang's residence, and he repeatedly humiliated Li Wang—"</p><p>"He deserves to die! He deserves to die—!"</p><p>At this moment, whether it was Jiang Qingliang or Xue Jun, they were all stunned.</p><p>Wenchuan, despicable.</p><p>How could Brother Nie speak like this?</p><p>Both his actions and his curses toward Jiang Juan had completely overturned Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang's previous perceptions of him.</p><p>"...Don't say such things about Brother Juan; he is actually quite good."</p><p>After being shocked, Xue Jun said with a complex expression, "He pushed you into the lake—Brother Nie, Brother Juan has an illness, his body is not well, how could he have the strength to push someone? Besides, he is so timid; when I gave him a golden cicada before, it made him cry. How could he dare to push someone?"</p><p>"I had always wanted to ask what exactly happened, but Gu Puwang stopped me, saying that he couldn't explain."</p><p>Xue Jun said, "Brother Nie, whatever I said before, I believed. I trusted his words, but today I suddenly realized... it seems like I didn't really know him at all."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang also said, "Blaming Brother Juan for the humiliation at Princess Chang's residence... but Brother Nie, this matter is actually Li Houge's fault."</p><p>Gu Puwang did not speak, only frowned at Jiang Nian, clearly disagreeing with his words. Their three attitudes could not have been more obvious.</p><p>Jiang Nian only felt a dizzy spell.</p><p>Why did these three suddenly turn on Jiang Juan?</p><p>When had they started interacting with each other?</p><p>They, they —— </p><p>There were thousands of words in their hearts, hundreds of emotions swirling within. Jiang Nian really couldn't understand what was going on. He spent so much time getting close to them and went out of his way to please them, only for it all to come to nothing!</p><p>"They..."</p><p>Jiang Nian felt the world spin before him. Gao Puwang also seemed at a loss, biting his lip as he struggled to hold back his anger, uttering a few words before turning around and walking away.</p><p>"It was my mistake to misjudge you!"</p><p>They had torn apart their friendship in such an ugly manner, and Xue Jun and the others were not happy about it either. After all, they had been friends for many years.</p><p>Xue Jun sighed deeply, leaning on the railing and staring blankly into space. "Why did things turn so bad?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang joined him, saying with a confused look, "Did we really come to know Brother Nian without truly understanding him?"</p><p>Xue Jun's mood was low as he replied, "Yeah."</p><p>Gu Puwang came over and corrected them, "It's you all, not us."</p><p>Both Xue Jun and Jiang Qingliang turned to look at him. This time, they didn't immediately start squabbling as they usually did, mainly because their friendship had indeed soured.</p><p>They glared at Gu Puwang for a while with their eyes before lowering their heads once more, sighing sadly. Gu Puwang remained silent and gazed far into the distance, looking like —— </p><p>Lan Ting commented, "Three dejected little dogs."</p><p>The tea house and the Lantern Moon Pavilion stood facing each other, but the tea house was relatively low and shrouded by bamboo curtains. Several people on the opposite side had waited for a long time at the railing but still couldn't see Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan praised her: "…What a good metaphor."</p><p>Lan Ting smiled, "I don’t know what they said to Young Master Er, but it ended unhappily. He looked quite displeased, and they seemed rather despondent too."</p><p>Although Jiang Juan didn’t know the specifics of their conversation, she felt there was some connection to what Lan Ting had mentioned earlier. After all, among them, Jiang Nian could be considered handsome and kind; this setup seemed to have collapsed.</p><p>In recent times, they had been getting quite close with Jiang Juan. Originally, she had intended to distance herself from the main group, but despite her complaints about them being a bunch of little kids, she still enjoyed hanging out with them because it was fun to play around.</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan said to Lan Ting, "Lan Ting, could you run over for me? Please?"</p><p>Not long after, Lan Ting arrived at the Lantern Moon Pavilion.</p><p>"Sixth Prince, Young Master Jiang, Young Master Gu…"</p><p>Lan Ting softly called out. The three people leaning on the railing turned their heads. Lan Ting took her hand from behind her back and said with a smile, "Young Master asked me to deliver this to you guys."</p><p>In her hand were three strings of candied haws, with golden-brown sugar coating wrapped around red haw berries. Lan Ting smiled and said, "Only eating candy can soothe one’s worries. Young Master, please enjoy the candied haws."</p><p>Xue Jun and company were taken aback but soon laughed. Only Jiang Qingliang muttered to himself, "Eating candied haws? Do you think we’re kids?"</p><p>Despite his complaints, he ran fastest, snatching a string of candied haws from Lan Ting’s hand. Jiang Qingliang asked, "Where’s Brother Juan? Where is he? How did he know we were unhappy?"</p><p>"He’s at the tea house on the opposite side. You should be able to see him if you look down."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang lowered his head and searched one by one. Soon enough, his eyes lit up, and the sad puppy turned happy in an instant. Jiang Qingliang shouted, "Brother Juan! Brother Juan!"</p><p>Hearing his voice, Jiang Juan turned his head, but it was to no avail; he couldn’t see anything. Nonetheless, he asked, "What’s going on?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang yelled loudly, "Come find us to play!"</p><p>The tea house and the Lantern Moon Pavilion faced each other, but the tea house was shorter and obscured by bamboo curtains, making it difficult for those standing at the railing opposite to spot Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan praised her: “…What a vivid metaphor.”</p><p>Lan Ting smiled. “I wonder what they said to Young Master Er; they certainly didn’t leave on good terms. He seemed quite disheartened, and so did they.”</p><p>Though Jiang Juan wasn’t privy to their conversation’s details, she sensed a connection to what Lan Ting had mentioned earlier. After all, among them, Jiang Nian was known for his handsomeness and kindness; this image seemed to have crumbled.</p><p>In recent times, they had become quite close with Jiang Juan. Initially, she had aimed to distance herself from the main group, but despite her disdain for their childish behavior, she still enjoyed hanging out with them because it was fun to play around.</p><p>After some thought, Jiang Juan said to Lan Ting, “Lan Ting, could you run over and do something for me? Please?”</p><p>Shortly after, Lan Ting arrived at the Lantern Moon Pavilion.</p><p>“Sixth Prince, Young Master Jiang, Young Master Gu…”</p><p>Lan Ting softly called out. The three people leaning on the railing turned their heads. Lan Ting brought her hand from behind her back and said with a smile, “Young Master asked me to deliver this to you.”</p><p>In her hand were three strings of candied haws, each wrapped in golden-brown sugar coating around red haw berries. Lan Ting smiled and said, “Only eating candy can soothe one’s worries. Please enjoy the candied haws, Young Master.”</p><p>Xue Jun and his companions were surprised at first but soon laughed. Only Jiang Qingliang muttered to himself, “Eating candied haws? Do you think we’re kids?”</p><p>Despite his complaints, he ran forward, grabbing a string of candied haws from Lan Ting’s hand. Jiang Qingliang called out, “Where’s Brother Juan? Where is he? How did he know we were unhappy?”</p><p>“He’s at the tea house on the opposite side. You should be able to see him if you look down.”</p><p>Jiang Qingliang lowered his head and began searching. Soon, his eyes lit up, transforming his sorrow into happiness in an instant. Jiang Qingliang shouted, “Brother Juan! Brother Juan!”</p><p>Hearing the commotion, Jiang Juan turned his head but saw nothing. Nevertheless, he asked, “What’s going on?”</p><p>Jiang Qingliang yelled loudly, “Come find us to play!”</p><p>The tea house and Lantern Moon Pavilion stood opposite each other, but the tea house was shorter and shrouded by bamboo curtains, making it difficult for those on the opposite side to see Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan praised her: "…What a vivid metaphor."</p><p>Lan Ting smiled. "I wonder what they said to Young Master Er; their conversation didn't go well at all.

Jiang Qingliang shouted, "Brother Juan! Brother Juan!"</p><p>Hearing the commotion, Jiang Juan turned his head but saw nothing. Nevertheless, he asked, "What’s going on?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang yelled loudly, "Come find us to play!"</p><p>The last word had just come out when the bamboo curtain was pulled back. Xue Fangli turned his head to the side, and a warning glance came over him, almost making him shiver down to his bones. Jiang Qingliang only felt his hair stand on end.</p><p>"…Forget it. Let's play another day."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang shivered, fumbled to touch his nose, and submitted pathetically.</p><p>Xue Jun was unusually clever once, guessing that his fifth brother would never let Juan ge act alone and predicting this outcome. Unable to find Juan ge to play with, he still had the candied haws given to him by Xue Jun, who lowered his head to bite into one.</p><p>It was so sweet.</p><p>The knot in his heart seemed to ease a little, and he felt better too.</p><p>What could alleviate sorrow? Only eating candy.</p><p>Clearly, what alleviated sorrow was only Juan ge.</p><p>Xue Jun was just swaying his head in thought when the candied haws were snatched away from him. Jiang Qingliang had finished his own candied haws and started to covet others'. He stuck out his tongue, staining two Hawthorn berries. Xue Jun went mad upon seeing this, "F*cking hell, this is my candied haws!"</p><p>He leaped at Jiang Qingliang's neck. Seeing these two fight, Gu Puwang stepped back a few steps in disgust, not wanting to be involved.</p><p>Although the candied haws were still in his hand, Gu Puwang did not touch them. Lan Ting, seeing this, curiously asked him, "Young Master Gu, why aren't you eating it? Do you not like it?"</p><p>Gu Puwang did not answer immediately; he just lowered his head to look at the candied haws for a long time before slowly smiling. "It's not that I don't like it."</p><p>"It has been a long time since anyone used candied haws to cheer me up. I find it hard to part with them."</p>
