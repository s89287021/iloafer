						<p>On the twenty-first day of September, it is auspicious for weddings.</p><p>The Lingguang Hall was bustling with activity. The maids stood by respectfully, frequently sneaking glances at one corner and then bursting into laughter.</p><p>——The new emperor and empress are about to hold their ceremony!</p><p>"Master, shall I assist you?"</p><p>Lanting stood outside the screen and asked Jiang Juan, who did not respond for a while before slowly coming out and complaining to Lanting, "It's so troublesome."</p><p>Lanting laughed and said, "A wedding gown, of course it will..."</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Lanting saw someone and stopped talking.</p><p>Prior to this, Jiang Juan had not worn red clothes either.</p><p>During the coronation ceremony and enthronement rites, Jiang Juan had worn crimson robes or phoenix dresses, magnificent and intricate. He looked as beautiful as a little phoenix, proud and passionate.</p><p>A splendid and flourishing hawthorn flower.</p><p>Lanting stared at him for a long time before murmuring, "Master, you look beautiful."</p><p>In the past, Jiang Juan had been pure like a celestial being from the Jade Pool, as clear as a small bodhisattva sitting on a lotus pedestal. But when he wore this wedding gown, his appearance was truly radiant like spring dawn, setting him apart.</p><p>Jiang Juan furrowed his brows and said, "What nonsense are you talking."</p><p>Lanting finally came back to her senses, realizing that Jiang Juan was not really angry but just embarrassed. Lanting laughed continuously, then pressed Jiang Juan to sit in front of the mirror and picked up a comb.</p><p>"Master, according to custom, it should be your family's womenfolk who would groom you. But Mr. has never married, and Lady passed away early, so..."</p><p>Lanting said, "Today, I can only trouble you. The maid will comb your hair for you."</p><p>"Why is there no woman here?" Jiang Juan said seriously, "You should be the one to comb it."</p><p>Lanting was taken aback and then she pursed her lips into a smile, gently lowering the comb.</p><p>"One comb to the end, no worries about wealth; two combs to the end, no illness or sorrow; three combs to the tail, equal standing in marriage."</p><p>Lanting recited each word slowly as Jiang Juan's long hair flowed like a waterfall over her shoulders. Finally, Lanting secured it with a hairpin and took the phoenix crown from the maid to place on Jiang Juan.</p><p>"It's so heavy."</p><p>The tassel swayed, and Jiang Juan tried to lift his head. Lanting quickly held him down, "Master, don't move."</p><p>Unable to move his head, Jiang Juan moved his hands instead, using his fingers to play with the tassel hanging between his eyes.</p><p>"Meow."</p><p>With a splash, a cat leaped onto the mirror stand. It was light brown with black stripes all over, resembling a plump weasel but with four ears.</p><p>Jiang Juan called out to it, "Tuanyuan."</p><p>As its name suggested, this young weasel cat, not even four months old, had been pampered into a little piglet, round and chubby. Hearing Jiang Juan call, the weasel cat sprang onto his lap, but Lanting quickly stopped it.</p><p>"No—! Don't hold it!"</p><p>Lanting hurriedly intercepted, and the little fat cat landed squarely in her chest. It took her quite some time to recover.</p><p>She disapprovingly said to Jiang Juan, "Master, don't hold it today; you'll get covered in fur."</p><p>In fact, Lanting believed that Xue Tuanyuan shouldn't be here at all. According to tradition, the bride and groom couldn't meet before the wedding. After Xue Fangli left, Jiang Juan felt bored and insisted on having Xue Tuanyuan brought to him for play.</p><p>"Getting cat hair on you won't be a big deal."</p><p>Jiang Juan wasn't too concerned, so Lan Ting had to remind him, "His Majesty does not like cat hair."</p><p>"He likes it or he doesn't..."</p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Juan remembered something and blinked at Lan Ting, saying, "He dislikes so many things; we don't need to worry about that. Lan Ting, have someone take Tuanzi to the new room later."</p><p>Lan Ting: "Ah?"</p><p>They were planning to spend the night in their bridal chamber that evening. Lan Ting asked Jiang Juan, "What do you mean by taking the cat there?"</p><p>Of course, it was to cause trouble!</p><p>Xue Fangli wasn't human; whenever he returned to Jiang Juan's arms after being away, he would be tormented from head to toe several times. There was no doubt that Xue Fangli wouldn't let him off easy tonight. Jiang Juan had already been a bit apprehensive about it, but Lan Ting had reminded him.</p><p>Jiang Juan replied, "Play with the cat together?"</p><p>Lan Ting: "... "</p><p>Is playing with cats supposed to happen during their honeymoon night?</p><p>Lan Ting hesitated to speak. Seeing this, Jiang Juan solemnly said, "This is our eldest son, the future Crown Prince. It wouldn't make sense for him not to be present on our wedding night."</p><p>What's a Crown Prince? This is just a cat. Lan Ting sighed and said helplessly, "Young Master, if you want a Crown Prince, why don't you eat more dates and peanuts and try your best?"</p><p>This isn't about having children; eating more wouldn't work. Jiang Juan glanced at her, attributing everything to Xue Fangli regardless of the situation. "What can I do? Without a Crown Prince, it's not His Majesty's fault for not trying hard enough."</p><p>Lan Ting said wistfully, "Young Master, His Majesty will find out."</p><p>Jiang Juan shuddered and immediately closed his mouth, no longer daring to speak casually.</p><p>Not long after, as the auspicious time arrived, the red veil fell down.</p><p>"Sir, let me help you," Lan Ting said softly, lifting Jiang Juan up and leading him out of the hall.</p><p>Jiang Juan knew that Xue Congyun would carry him to the sedan chair afterward.</p><p>"Prince Jing, excuse me…"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Lan Ting froze. Jiang Juan didn't notice anything and neither did he see the other person make a "shhh" gesture at Lan Ting. Lan Ting smiled and said nothing, helping Xue Congyun lift Jiang Juan.</p><p>Xue Congyun was usually uncoordinated, but carrying someone turned out to be rather steady for him.</p><p>He walked for quite a while without saying anything. Jiang Juan, not used to the silence, poked his back, "Why aren't you talking?"</p><p>Xue Congyun ignored him.</p><p>Jiang Juan poked again, "Why are you so quiet?"</p><p>Xue Congyun remained silent.</p><p>Jiang Juan found it strange and just then, the person carrying him laughed heartily and spoke, "Brother Juan, it's me!"</p><p>Startled by the sudden sound, Jiang Juan jumped. But when he came to his senses, he was overjoyed.</p><p>"Jiang Qingliang, is that you? You're back?"</p><p>During this period, Jiang Qingliang had been at the border, and Jiang Juan never expected him to rush back.</p><p>"Yeah, Brother Juan, how could I possibly not come for your wedding?" Jiang Qingliang laughed merrily. "Besides, it's not just me."</p><p>Not long after, as the auspicious time arrived, the red veil fell down.</p><p>"Sir, let me help you," Lan Ting said softly, lifting Jiang Juan up and leading him out of the hall.</p><p>Jiang Juan knew that Xue Congyun would carry him to the sedan chair afterward.</p><p>"Prince Jing, excuse me…"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Lan Ting froze. Jiang Juan didn't notice anything and neither did he see the other person make a "shhh" gesture at Lan Ting.

But when he came to his senses, he was overjoyed.</p><p>"Jiang Qingliang, is that you? You're back?"</p><p>During this period, Jiang Qingliang had been at the border, and Jiang Juan never expected him to rush back.</p><p>"Yeah, Brother Juan, how could I possibly not come for your wedding?" Jiang Qingliang laughed merrily. "Besides, it's not just me."</p><p>"Juan Ge."</p><p>It was Gu Puwang's voice.</p><p>Jiang Juan was very happy, "You're back too."</p><p>Gu Puwang smiled slightly, "Yes, calling you Brother Juan, you are no other brother. We naturally have to send you up in the sedan chair."</p><p>They traveled thousands of miles to rush back to Beijing; it would be impossible for Jiang Juan not to feel touched.</p><p>Xue Congjun had also said that this grand wedding was a pity because Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang could not make it back.</p><p>The frontier is remote, and military discipline is strict. If Jiang Qingliang were to return this time, apart from being dusty and sleepless on the road, he would certainly be punished when he returned to the frontier.</p><p>Jiang Juan thanked them seriously, "Thank you..."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang waved his hand, "For what?"</p><p>Gu Puwang also said "Mm," "When you were unconscious, we couldn't help. Today is your grand wedding day; of course, we can't miss it again."</p><p>Jiang Juan couldn't help but laugh, but he didn't forget that one person was missing. Jiang Juan asked, "Where's Xue Congjun?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang's expression stiffened as he said awkwardly, "He'll be here later."</p><p>Gu Puwang calmly agreed, "Mm, he told us to come first. Brother Juan, let me carry you."</p><p>Jiang Juan said "Oh," "Alright."</p><p>Gu Puwang carried Jiang Juan out of Lingguang Hall and into the sedan chair.</p><p>Jiang Juan had just sat down when she heard Xue Congjun's voice.</p><p>"Jiang Qingliang! Gu Puwang! You two beasts!"</p><p>Xue Congjun ran over with rage, "You two actually teamed up to send me away and secretly carried Brother Juan away!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>How could this be.</p><p>Xue Congjun raged on, "Beasts! You two are just beasts!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang retorted fiercely, "What did you brag about in your letter? That it was too bad we couldn't return, that you were forced to carry Brother Juan into the sedan chair alone, and you were afraid of carrying him badly."</p><p>Gu Puwang remained calm, "We were only trying to relieve Prince Jing's worries."</p><p>Xue Congjun: "..."</p><p>Wasn't this boasting? Who wanted their help in relieving worries. Xue Congjun gritted his teeth until they clicked, glared fiercely at Jiang Qingliang and Gu Puwang, then turned to the sedan chair and sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p>"Brother Juan! Brother Juan—!"</p><p>Xue Congjun cried like a heartbroken piggy, "Let me carry you. Hurry up and come out, let me carry you. They've all carried you; I want to too!"</p><p>"Brother Juan!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He sighed, feeling quite fond of his foolish son Xue Congjun. Just as Jiang Juan was about to support the sedan chair and stand up, a gong sounded, and Manager Wang's shrill voice echoed, "Start the sedan chair—!"</p><p>Hearing this, Xue Congjun cried even louder.</p><p>"Juan Ge wuwu wuwu wuwu!"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "......"</p><p>Upon arrival, fireworks lit up the sky.</p><p>Only then did Jiang Juan lift the curtain of the carriage. A hand reached out towards him.</p><p>The skin was pale, the joints clear, a hand that Jiang Juan had held many times and made cry countless times.</p><p>Yet, Jiang Juan still extended his hand without hesitation.</p><p>Their fingertips touched, and the other person immediately tightened their grip on Jiang Juan's fingers, pulling him out of the carriage.</p><p>With his vision obscured, Jiang Juan could not see much, only the crimson sleeves and trailing skirts of the other person.</p><p>In the next moment, Jiang Juan was picked up across the chest.</p><p>Jiang Juan asked Xue Fangli, "Why didn't you carry me?"</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him, "If I carried you, I couldn't see you."</p><p>Jiang Juan narrowed his eyes and smiled silently.</p><p>Entering the main hall, Xue Fangli set Jiang Juan down, each holding one end of a red silk ribbon.</p><p>This grand wedding did not attract many guests, but Gu Xiang, General Jiang, and Bai Xuechao were present. Bai Xuechao was even invited to sit in a high position.</p><p>Wang Zongguan said with a beaming smile, "One bow to heaven and earth?!"</p><p>"Two bows to our parents!"</p><p>"Bow to each other as husband and wife!"</p><p>"Bring him into the—bridal chamber!"</p><p>The red candles flickered, and the light veil rose gently.</p><p>Footsteps grew closer.</p><p>Jiang Juan sat on the wedding bed. The phoenix crown was too heavy, and the red veil was too stifling. He had several times thought of taking them off but held back each time.</p><p>When Xue Fangli entered, Jiang Juan remained quietly seated there, obedient as a lamb.</p><p>The young man's face was tinged with the colors of the world, his beauty reaching an extreme. His little bodhisattva had dressed him in wedding attire on this day and became his new bride.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him for a long time.</p><p>"Hurry up; it's too heavy."</p><p>For some reason, Jiang Juan suddenly felt a bit shy.</p><p>It wasn't as if he hadn't seen it before.</p><p>Jiang Juan muttered to himself, but he couldn't help feeling nervous.</p><p>Xue Fangli gazed at Jiang Juan, slowly lifting the red veil.</p><p>Jiang Juan was the one who urged him on, but when the red veil was truly lifted, she nervously lowered her lashes and dared not meet his gaze. Only the tassels hanging from her forehead swayed back and forth.</p><p>It felt cold and smooth.</p><p>This was a delicate gesture, but coming from him, it exuded an indescribable pride. Xue Fangli lowered his eyes, letting his gaze linger on Jiang Juan's body.</p><p>The tassels swayed, and Jiang Juan's lashes fluttered.</p><p>Pounding, pounding, pounding.</p><p>He heard the sound of his own heartbeat.</p><p>"How could a husband like me deserve such a wife?"</p><p>Xue Fangli’s voice was seductive.</p><p>Jiang Juan, feigning calmness, asked him, "What kind?"</p><p>"A beautiful and delicious wife."</p><p>He spoke each word slowly and deliberately.</p><p>What was so beautiful and delicious? Jiang Juan should have been angry, but whenever she looked into Xue Fangli's eyes, she felt even more bashful.</p><p>The flickering flames cast a mesmerizing glow as Jiang Juan roamed his eyes around restlessly. Beneath his lashes, his gaze was moist with emotion, while his face radiated an elegant hue that complemented his wedding gown, truly a sight to behold.</p><p>Xue Fangli looked at him and smiled, "Madam, it's time for the honey wine."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and simultaneously picked up the specially made cups with Xue Fangli—each gourd split into two halves and connected by a red string at the end.</p><p>They exchanged glances, then Jiang Juan lowered his head to drink the honey wine.</p><p>It was very bitter.</p><p>Not palatable.</p><p>Furrowing his brow, Jiang Juan still managed to finish the wine. He said to Xue Fangli, "This wine is so hard to drink."</p><p>"Are there any? candied fruits?"</p><p>Clearly it was a fine brew, yet Jiang Juan disliked it so much. Xue Fangli didn't say anything and simply stared at Jiang Juan's lips stained with wine before casually asking, "Come over."</p><p>Jiang Juan thought the candied fruits were on Xue Fangli's side, so he walked towards him. Suddenly, an arm snaked around his waist, pulling him closer. Xue Fangli pressed his forehead against Jiang Juan's and spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><p>"There are no? candied fruits."</p><p>Jiang Juan widened his eyes, "If there are no? candied fruits, why did you make me come over?"</p><p>Xue Fangli spoke softly and slowly, "Besides candied fruits, there is another way."</p><p>"If you kiss fiercely enough, you won't taste the bitterness."</p><p>Jiang Juan was taken aback for a moment before finally uttering an "oh." He pursed his lips, looking left and right warily, but then slowly said, "Then hurry up and kiss me. This wine really is so hard to drink."</p><p>Xue Fangli smiled quietly and leaned in to kiss Jiang Juan.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Jiang Juan sank into the bed. Xue Fangli raised his hand to pull back the canopy, and the red gauze curtains fell layer by layer. He bent down and kissed Jiang Juan again, pressing forcefully on that slender, supple waist. Jiang Juan's gaze was dazed.</p><p>The atmosphere gradually became sticky. Xue Fangli untied Jiang Juan's belt, but in the next moment—</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Jiang Juan was suddenly awakened.</p><p>On the bed of joy, there lay a fat cat that looked like a piglet. Xue Tuanzi turned his head curiously and looked at Jiang Juan innocently. Beneath its plump paws was a mouse.</p><p>Jiang Juan was stunned, "Mouse, there's a mouse!"</p><p>He almost jumped off the bed. Xue Tuanzi approached curiously, but with this movement, the mouse seized the opportunity to leap up swiftly, darting around wildly.</p><p>"Bang—"</p><p>"Cling clatter—!"</p><p>Amidst the chaos in the room, the mouse nearly leaped onto Jiang Juan. Jiang Juan was on the verge of tears from fright and hugged Xue Fangli tightly. The entire person hung onto him. Xue Fangli could only hold him securely with a sinister look on his face: "Help, come quick."</p><p>This night of beauty began with Xue Tuanzi delivering a mouse as a gift.</p><p>That night, the flowers were in full bloom and the moon was perfectly round.</p>
