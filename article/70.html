						<p>Mouth-to-mouth feeding?</p><p>How do you mouth-to-mouth feed?</p><p>No matter how bad my mood is, curiosity always persists. Jiang Juan glanced at Xue Fangli. Initially, it was just a curious glance, but suddenly, an idea struck Jiang Juan, causing her body to stiffen.</p><p>Mouth-to-mouth feeding.</p><p>And...how exactly does one do mouth-to-mouth feeding.</p><p>It took her a moment to react, and Jiang Juan remained silent for several seconds before choosing to take the spoon. She lowered her head gracefully and started drinking the porridge bite by bite.</p><p>Xue Fangli sighed softly, seemingly quite disappointed. Jiang Juan heard it and bit down on the spoon, sneaking in a step.</p><p>The next second, Jiang Juan's hand was grasped, and her fingers were toyed with one by one. She heard the man's voice, filled with amusement and nearly mocking, "So, you still want this king to feed you mouth-to-mouth?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied quickly, completely unaware that someone had been staring at them for a long time.</p><p>It would be impossible not to be surprised.</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao held his wine cup for a long time without taking a sip, lost in thought.</p><p>A few decades ago, he was too late. No matter how much he tried to make up for it later, the young man remained indifferent, staring at him coldly, like a hedgehog raising its spines to anyone who approached, no longer trusting anyone.</p><p>He never imagined he would see such a scene.</p><p>Tender, warm, and gentle.</p><p>He also never thought that the young man of old would one day be so patient and treat someone with great care and respect.</p><p>Without knowing how, it turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>Su Fei Yue was right.</p><p>—"His Consort Queen pulled him down."</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao revealed a relieved smile. He stood up and said gratefully, "Consort Queen, your servant will toast you."</p><p>Jiang Juan was startled, "Oh, okay."</p><p>Since he didn't drink alcohol, he didn't ask his maid to pour him a cup. Looking left and right, Jiang Juan simply snatched the wine cup from Xue Fang Li's hand and took a small sip.</p><p>The wine cup was taken away, leaving his hands empty, but Xue Fang Li wasn't upset. He merely glanced at Jiang Juan, who couldn't get used to strong alcohol, with his eyebrows furrowed, then chuckled softly.</p><p>Perhaps the Wangfu should prepare more fruit wine.</p><p>When young men got drunk... it was the most entertaining.</p><p>Xue Fang Li's expression turned thoughtful.</p><p>Having finished most of the porridge, Jiang Juan felt that General and Prince still had something to discuss. He asked, "General Jiang, where is Jiang Qing Liang?"</p><p>"He is in his courtyard."</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao smiled, "I heard he has been frequently interacting with someone recently, but are you looking for him?"</p><p>Idle hands should find something to do; why not stir up some trouble? Jiang Juan asked him, "Is it okay?"</p><p>Jiang Sen Tao quickly gave a signal to the steward of the mansion, "Consort Queen, there is no need to be so polite."</p><p>Jiang Juan nodded and stood up. After taking a few steps, he turned around. His hand was still being held, and Jiang Juan looked at Xue Fang Li, shaking it a few times, "Prince, I will go play."</p><p>Xue Fangli glanced at him without saying a word. Jiang Juan thought for a moment and asked, "Zhe… also?" Xue Fangli snorted lightly, "Not." Jiang Juan: "…" That Zhe let go of his hand. Jiang Juan looked at him curiously, shaking his head a few more times before Xue Fangli used some force to pull Jiang Juan back, saying with a half-smile, "You were only willing to stay by this king’s side; now you seem to enjoy hanging around with some odd people." What kind of odd people? Jiang Juan said seriously, "Let’s talk about important matters. This is so boring; I don’t want to listen." Xue Fangli nodded, though he was slightly unhappy, he did not really detain Jiang Juan. He simply instructed the steward at the military mansion, "He has always had heart disease; keep an eye on him." The steward answered respectfully. Jiang Juan’s hand was finally released, and he said goodbye to Xue Fangli before following the steward away. Jiang Qingliang lived in Liangji Yard. The steward knocked on the door, and Jiang Qingliang’s voice echoed from inside, "Who is it?" "Young Master, it’s me." "There are so many people in the mansion; if you don’t say your name, how will I know who it is?" "… Zhao." "There are many surnames Zhao; which Zhao are you talking about?" Jiang Juan: "…" He even argued over this. No wonder he was Jiang Qingliang; Jiang Juan was stunned. Jiang Qingliang insolently spoke again, "Why aren’t you speaking? Don’t you know that the surname Zhao is ranked first on the Hundred Family Surnames list? Who are you?" The steward smiled bitterly, and before he could respond, Jiang Juan said from in front of him, "Dad."</p><p>Jiang Juan slowly asked him: "Not many people have called you 'daddy', right?"</p><p>Zhang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Zhang Qingliang: "............"</p><p>Indeed, not many.</p><p>A clatter and rattle sounded in the study. Zhang Qingliang rushed over, opened the door, and excitedly asked him: "Brother Juan, how did you come?"</p><p>Jiang Juan honestly said: "I came to argue with you."</p><p>Zhang Qingliang: "? ? ?"</p><p>Zhang Qingliang was choked up again. Jiang Juan was satisfied; he peeked inside and saw a book laid out on the desk, with many words written on it. Jiang Juan curiously asked: "What are you doing?"</p><p>Zhang Qingliang pursed his lips and said, "My performance in this month's evaluation was terrible. The Prefect of Sacrifices reported me to my father, who punished me by making me copy the entire《Wenyuan Yinghua》."</p><p>Jiang Juan snorted.</p><p>Zhang Qingliang had to finish copying the whole book before it got dark. He had been slacking off for too long and now couldn't afford to pay attention to Jiang Juan. Without saying much, he drooped his head and continued copying. Jiang Juan looked at him and, out of rare kindness, asked: "Do you want me to help copy a bit?"</p><p>Zhang Qingliang was astonished: "Huh? !"</p><p>"Brother Juan, I don't mean to be rude, but can you read?"</p><p>After holding it back for so long, Zhang Qingliang blurted out another sentence.</p><p>It wasn't surprising that he asked this question. Zhang Qingliang didn't have any ill intentions; he had always known that Jiang Juan grew up in the countryside, where there were no schools. Furthermore, there was a rumor in the capital that Jiang Juan couldn't read characters, so hearing Jiang Juan offer to help copy made Zhang Qingliang shocked.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>Damn, he was just a piece of salted fish, and not someone who slipped through the cracks of compulsory education. Moreover, Jiang Juan still had his grandfather enforcing his self-cultivation, so he had been forced to learn quite a bit. It was merely a matter of copying.</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at Jiang Qingliang with the intention of scaring him, "It's just copying, right? Even if you can't read, you can copy it, just like drawing; follow along."</p><p>After saying that, Jiang Juan took the brush from his hand and looked down at the words on the paper. He hesitated for a long time without putting pen to paper, as if he really couldn’t read, pondering how to follow along.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was filled with cold dread. He shouted, "Brother Juan, so what if you can't read, don't do anything crazy! My dad is very strict; I'm not allowed any corrections, and if I make a mistake, I have to start over. I've copied so much already, I don’t want to start from the beginning again, Brother Juan, Brother Juan—!"</p><p>"No, this really isn't like drawing at all. Don't try to follow along! Your goodwill is noted, but no, no need for me to beg on my knees!"</p><p>"It's not a big problem."</p><p>Amidst his wailing and sobbing, Jiang Juan wrote without hesitation, then exclaimed, "It seems I've written it wrong."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "……"</p><p>Written wrong, there was nothing he could do about it now. Jiang Qingliang slumped backward, tears welling up in his eyes but no tears to shed as he said, "Brother Juan, I already told you that it wouldn't work."</p><p>Betrayed like this, Jiang Qingliang didn’t even think of cursing; instead, he kept pounding his chest in frustration. After all—</p><p>Why would his Brother Juan have any ill intentions? He just wanted to help him copy the text.</p><p>Xue Congjun and Gu Puwang did not receive the same treatment.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was suffering yet happy at the same time; his father was simply too strict, so even if one word was written wrong, he would have to start over. Jiang Qingliang resignedly reclaimed the brush from Jiang Juan with a long sigh, "Forget it, I'll just rewrite it."</p><p>"Brother Juan, are you still playing around by drawing? If you’re going to play, give me this sheet, and I’ll get someone else to fetch another brush for you."</p><p>Jiang Juan glanced at him. "Don’t you want to look?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang's heart ached; the longer he looked, the more pain he felt. He waved his hand, "I won't look."</p><p>Jiang Juan no longer wanted to deceive him, "Still want to take a look, huh?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang really didn't want to see it. He thought that since Jiang Juan had never been educated and couldn't read or write, when this was her first time writing, she still took a look. The result——</p><p>"Eh? Brother Juan, where did you write it?"</p><p>On the paper were all of Jiang Qingliang's own scrawl. There wasn't even a black ink blob from a mistake. After a while, he finally realized, "Brother Juan, you didn't write anything, right? You were just toying with me."</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "How could I not have written it? The last character was written by me. Where did I copy from? Don't you remember?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "? ??"</p><p>He looked again, and this time there was a problem.</p><p>The last character really wasn't written by him.</p><p>Whether it was the beginning stroke or the structure of the character, it was exactly like his writing habits. If Jiang Juan hadn't mentioned it and if Jiang Qingliang hadn't recalled where he copied from, he would have never recognized it.</p><p>Not just similar, it was identical.</p><p>"Brother Juan, you can read!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was so shocked that he couldn't close his mouth.</p><p>In fact, just by looking a few times, the degree to which his handwriting was imitated made Jiang Juan not only able to read but also revealed that Jiang Qingliang had been slacking off. He was delighted, "Brother Juan, you're actually this capable. Come on, copy some more for me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang immediately changed his expression and readily admitted his mistake, "Brother Juan, I couldn't recognize a gem when I saw it. Please, copy a bit more for me."</p><p>When Jiang Juan said he would help him copy, it was just an impulse, and he regretted it as soon as he finished speaking. However, once he regained clarity, he shook his head and said, "There are too many characters, and I don't want to copy anymore. Besides——"</p><p>Imitating someone's handwriting wasn't about writing it as poorly as possible; if it was written too badly, the structure would lack coherence, making the imitation even more exhausting. Jiang Juan said, "Your writing is too poor to imitate."</p><p>Jiang Juan no longer wanted to deceive him, "Still want to take a look?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang really didn't want to see it. He thought that since Jiang Juan had never been educated and couldn't read or write, she must have written something the first time, so he took a look. The result——</p><p>"Eh? Brother Juan, where did you write it?"</p><p>The paper was covered with Jiang Qingliang's own scrawl. There weren't even any smudges from mistakes. After a moment, he finally realized, "Brother Juan, you didn't write anything! You were just toying with me."</p><p>Jiang Juan said slowly, "How could I not have written it? The last character was written by me. Where did I copy from? Don't you remember?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "? ??"</p><p>He looked again, and this time he saw something odd.</p><p>The last character really wasn't written by him.</p><p>Whether it was the starting stroke or the structure of the character, it perfectly matched Jiang Qingliang's handwriting habits. If Jiang Juan hadn't mentioned it and if Jiang Qingliang hadn't recalled where he copied from, he would have never recognized it.</p><p>Not just similar; it was identical.</p><p>"Brother Juan, you can read!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was so shocked that he couldn't close his mouth.</p><p>In fact, after only a few glances, the degree to which his handwriting was imitated revealed that Jiang Juan not only could read but also that Jiang Qingliang had been slacking off. He was delighted, "Brother Juan, you're actually this capable. Come on, copy some more for me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang immediately changed his expression and readily admitted his mistake, "Brother Juan, I couldn't recognize a gem when I saw it. Please, copy a bit more for me."</p><p>When Jiang Juan said he would help him copy, it was just an impulse, but he regretted it as soon as he finished speaking. However, once he regained clarity, he shook his head and said, "There are too many characters, and I don't want to copy anymore.

Jiang Juan said, "Your writing is too poor to imitate."</p><p>Jiang Juan no longer wished to deceive him and said, "Still want to take a look?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang truly had no desire to see it. He thought that since Jiang Juan was uneducated and unable to read or write, this must have been her first attempt at writing. Therefore, he decided to take a look. The result——</p><p>"Eh? Brother Juan, where did you write it?"</p><p>The paper was filled with Jiang Qingliang's own messy handwriting. There weren't even any ink smudges from mistakes. After a moment of realization, he finally understood, "Brother Juan, you didn’t actually write anything! You were just toying with me."</p><p>Jiang Juan replied slowly, "How could I not have written it? The last character was written by me. Where did I copy from? Don't you remember?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was bewildered: "? ??"</p><p>He looked again and noticed something peculiar.</p><p>The last character really wasn’t his.</p><p>Whether it was the starting stroke or the structure of the character, it matched Jiang Qingliang’s handwriting perfectly. If not for Jiang Juan's mention and his own recollection of where he had copied from, he would never have recognized it.</p><p>Not just similar; it was identical.</p><p>"Brother Juan, you can read!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth.</p><p>In fact, with only a few glances, the degree to which his handwriting was imitated revealed that Jiang Juan could not only read but also that Jiang Qingliang had been slacking off. He felt delighted and said, "Brother Juan, you're actually this capable. Come on, copy some more for me."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang immediately changed his expression and admitted his mistake readily, "Brother Juan, I couldn’t recognize a gem when I saw it. Please, copy a bit more for me."</p><p>When Jiang Juan said he would help him copy, it was just an impulse, but he regretted it as soon as he finished speaking. However, once he regained clarity, he shook his head and explained, "There are too many characters, and I don’t want to copy anymore. Besides——"</p><p>Imitating someone's handwriting wasn't about writing it poorly; if written too badly, the structure would lack coherence, making the imitation even more exhausting. Jiang Juan said, "Your writing is too poor to imitate."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "..."</p><p>Damn, I got hurt.</p><p>Why did he speak out of turn.</p><p>Why did he believe the rumors and think that Brother Juan was illiterate?</p><p>Jiang Qingliang regretted it from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>He missed a good opportunity. Jiang Qingliang could only copy down the text diligently again, while Jiang Juan suddenly remembered something.</p><p>It seemed like everyone took for granted that he couldn't read big characters, even Jiang Juan himself subconsciously believed this—this character who shared the same name and surname with him had never studied, after all, he grew up in the countryside and didn't have the conditions to study.</p><p>The original body lived in the countryside; how could his grandfather afford to buy brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones for him to practice calligraphy?</p><p>Moreover, practicing calligraphy consumes a lot of resources. For someone living in the countryside, this would be quite an expense.</p><p>Could it be that his Secretary father gave him money?</p><p>It seemed that this explanation made sense... or did it?</p><p>Jiang Juan absentmindedly raised his hand and placed it on several stacks of books, his fingers subconsciously touching them. Jiang Juan lowered his head and looked; it was a travelogue titled "Taiping Youji".</p><p>He was quite curious about ancient travelogues, so he picked up the book. Jiang Qingliang was furiously writing and only said, "These books are borrowed from my classmate; he says they are good stuff."</p><p>How good exactly, Jiang Qingliang hadn't had time to read them yet. When Jiang Juan heard this, he became even more curious and flipped through the pages. In the next second, Jiang Juan froze in place.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "???"</p><p>Isn't this a travelogue?</p><p>The illustrations on the pages were exquisite, with diverse scenes and lifelike characters. However, the problem was that everyone in the pictures was completely naked, huddled together without any cover.</p><p>There was no censorship, and the large-scale illustrations were accompanied by detailed text, which had an immense impact on Jiang Juan.</p><p>Jiang Juan had never seen anything like it and felt embarrassed, but his curiosity got the better of him, so he gritted his teeth and turned the pages one by one.</p><p>He dared not look closely and flipped through them quickly, hearing "rustle" after "rustle." Before long, he had gone through more than half of the book. Jiang Juan glanced over it, and his fair fingers were about to turn another page—</p><p>His movement stopped.</p><p>In the last illustration on this page, a person was sitting in a chair with one leg raised and resting on the armrest, while another person was lowering their head in an absorbed posture.</p><p>It felt strangely familiar.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "……"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "…………"</p><p>With a snap, he nearly panicked as he shut the book closed.</p><p>The sudden sound made Jiang Qingliang shudder, almost writing the wrong character. He quickly corrected himself and asked while writing, "Brother Juan, what's going on?"</p><p>He looked up and was momentarily stunned, "Why is your face so red?"</p><p>"Really red?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was utterly bewildered. Jiang Qingliang stared at him, and before long, his own face turned red too. Jiang Qingliang shouted, "Brother Juan, don't keep staring at me like that."</p><p>"……Your face is really red too."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "?"</p><p>He touched his face and didn't feel it was hot. Jiang Qingliang shouted at him not to look, but he couldn't help glancing over and then glancing again. After all, who doesn't have a heart that yearns? His Jüan Ge this time... is he too...</p><p>Too... beautiful?</p><p>His face seemed to be painted with floral patterns, no, more vivid than any flower pattern. If one had to describe it as a flower, the peonies were truly national treasures, yet they seemed somewhat vulgar in comparison to his Jüan Ge. The plum blossoms were clear and jade-like, but they lacked vibrancy.</p><p>Jiang Qingliang thought hard but couldn't find an appropriate description. At this moment, he was somewhat regretful for not having studied well in the past.</p><p>If Gu Puwang had been here, he would have known how to describe it.</p><p>While Jiang Qingliang was feeling frustrated, Jiang Juan didn't care. His mind was a mess, and worst of all, the scenes from that book kept flashing through his mind.</p><p>Don't think, don't think.</p><p>Jiang Juan tried hard to stop himself, but the more he resisted, the less he could control it. He even remembered the sensation when his tongue brushed against the skin that day.</p><p>Scalding, wet.</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>The steward standing by his side also noticed something was wrong. Worried, he asked, "Madame, are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>Jiang Juan mumbled, "My heart is beating so fast."</p><p>Before handing over Madam to him, the Prince had instructed that she had a heart condition. Hearing this, the steward was startled, "Madame, has your heart condition flared up? I will immediately request the Prince and Lord?"</p><p>Jiang Juan snapped back to reality, "Ah? No, I don't think so?"</p><p>He said he didn't feel unwell, but after the steward's reminder, Jiang Qingliang became alarmed and exclaimed, "Why would it be beating fast out of nowhere? Quickly summon a doctor. What use is it for the Prince and my father if his heart condition flares up? Hurry up, get a doctor to check on him right away!"</p><p>"Nu zhe, zhe jiu ——!"</p><p>The steward ran off in terror. Jiang Juan could only reiterate again, "I'm fine, really."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang, however, remained on high alert and said, "The doctor is coming soon, Brother Juan, where do you feel uncomfortable?"</p><p>Jiang Juan: "..."</p><p>He truly wasn't feeling any discomfort.</p><p>Not long after, the doctor hadn't arrived yet, but Xue Fali did. He strode over to sit down forcefully in a chair, causing Jiang Juan, who was suffering from a relapse of his heart condition and had been forced to squat on the ground, to wince with pain. The layers of clothing billowed out, but Xue Fali merely held Jiang Juan's hand, his expression cold but his tone gentle, "Still uncomfortable?"</p><p>Jiang Juan said seriously, "Your Highness, don't worry, I'm fine."</p><p>Xue Fali lowered his eyelids and stared at Jiang Juan's pale fingers.</p><p>—— The steward had sent word that Jiang Juan's heart condition had flared up so severely that he couldn't even turn the pages of a book. He had sat there for quite some time but to no avail.</p><p>The young man was clearly afraid of pain, yet when it really hit him, he merely said that he was fine.</p><p>Xue Fali wished that Jiang Juan would cry out in pain as he used to, snuggling into his arms.</p><p>Thinking about this, Xue Fali's grip on Jiang Juan's hand loosened slightly. Jiang Juan winced and looked at him questioningly, but Xue Fali didn't say anything; instead, he picked up Jiang Juan and held him close.</p><p>"Guest room."</p><p>After a while, Xue Fali slowly uttered two words, "Guest room." Jiang Sen Tao, who had come with him, quickly signaled the maid, who then said, "Please follow Your Highness."</p><p>"Your Highness, why do we need to go to the guest room?"</p><p>Jiang Juan was feeling very confused. Xue Fangli looked at him a few times. At this moment, the ruddy color on Jiang Juan's face had already faded. The person Xue Fangli saw before him looked pale and weak.</p><p>It seemed like a vast expanse of snow, thin and faint, which would leave an impression if pressed and break if dropped.</p><p>Xue Fangli closed his eyes lightly, "Take a rest. When the physician comes, have a good look at you."</p><p>Jiang Juan: "... "</p><p>No, he really wasn't in trouble.</p><p>Jiang Juan wanted to speak but hesitated. Xue Fangli carried him out of the study room. Just as they were about to step out of the study room, Xue Fangli paused his steps, seemingly remembering something. He lowered his eyes and asked Jiang Juan, "Is he angry with someone again?"</p><p>Jiang Juan also shook his head hastily, "No, he wasn't angry with me."</p><p>Meng Sentao, however, shook his head vigorously when he heard this, "Your Highness, there's no need to hide anything for him. This boy is unruly all day long. Who else could have made him angry?"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang said helplessly, "Father, can't you be reasonable? I really didn't do anything. Ask Chun Tao if you don't believe me."</p><p>Meng Sentao looked at the maid called Chun Tao. The maid spoke softly, "Reporting to Your Excellency, Young Master was indeed copying books all along."</p><p>Jiang Qingliang muttered angrily, "I'm innocent!"</p><p>"Innocent? Innocent of what?"</p><p>Meng Sentao looked at him a few times and said firmly, "Your Highness's heart condition could have flared up anytime, but it happened to do so when he saw [UNKNOWN]. Instead of reflecting properly, you're still arguing back."</p><p>"Brat, run thirty laps on the battlefield for me!"</p><p>Jiang Qingliang: "??"</p><p>Is it his fault?</p><p>Who did he offend?!!!</p>
